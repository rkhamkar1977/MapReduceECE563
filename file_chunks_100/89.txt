a treasure&mdash;a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....
Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You've raised my
soul from the depths.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha's lips were quivering and he caught his breath.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has saved you, it seems,</q> laughed Rakitin spitefully. <q>And
she meant to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka jumped up. <q>Hush, both of you.
Now I'll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make
me ashamed, for I am bad and not good&mdash;that's what I am. And
you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea
of trying to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it's
all different. And don't let me hear anything more from you,
Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are both crazy,</q> said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement.
<q>I feel as though I were in a madhouse. They're both getting
so feeble they'll begin crying in a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall begin to cry, I shall,</q> repeated Grushenka. <q>He called
me his sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you,
Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and
annoyed, though he might have reflected that each of them was just
passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a
lifetime. But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything
that concerned himself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings
and sensations of others&mdash;partly from his youth and inexperience,
partly from his intense egoism.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, Alyosha,</q> Grushenka turned to him with a nervous
laugh. <q>I was boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an
onion, but it's not to boast I tell you about it. It's only a story, but
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
it's a nice story. I used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona,
my cook, who is still with me. It's like this. Once upon a time
there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she was. And
she died and did not leave a single good deed behind. The devils
caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire. So her guardian
angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember
to tell to God; <q>She once pulled up an onion in her garden,</q> said
he, <q>and gave it to a beggar woman.</q> And God answered: <q>You take
that onion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold
and be pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her
come to Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must
stay where she is.</q> The angel ran to the woman and held out the
onion to her. <q>Come,</q> said he, <q>catch hold and I'll pull you out.</q>
And he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her
right out, when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was
being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled
out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began
kicking them. <q>I'm to be pulled out, not you. It's my onion, not
yours.</q> As soon as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman
fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day. So the angel
wept and went away. So that's the story, Alyosha; I know it by
heart, for I am that wicked woman myself. I boasted to Rakitin
that I had given away an onion, but to you I'll say: <q>I've done
nothing but give away one onion all my life, that's the only good
deed I've done.</q> So don't praise me, Alyosha, don't think me good,
I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you
praise me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was
so anxious to get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five
roubles if he would bring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!</q>
</p>

<p>
She went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled
out a purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.
</p>

<p>
<q>What nonsense! What nonsense!</q> cried Rakitin, disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there's no fear of your refusing
it, you asked for it yourself.</q> And she threw the note to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Likely I should refuse it,</q> boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed,
but carrying off his confusion with a swagger. <q>That will come in
very handy; fools are made for wise men's profit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say
<pb n='393'/><anchor id='Pg393'/>
now is not for your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet.
You don't like us, so hold your tongue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I like you for?</q> Rakitin snarled, not concealing
his ill-humor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket
and he felt ashamed at Alyosha's seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving
his payment later, without Alyosha's knowing of it, and
now, feeling ashamed, he lost his temper. Till that moment he had
thought it discreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite
of her snubbing, since he had something to get out of her. But
now he, too, was angry:
</p>

<p>
<q>One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you
done for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make
such a fuss about it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke
with heat and there were hysterical notes in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don't dare to
speak to me like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in
that corner and be quiet, as though you were my footman! And
now, Alyosha, I'll tell you the whole truth, that you may see what
a wretch I am! I am not talking to Rakitin, but to you. I wanted
to ruin you, Alyosha, that's the holy truth; I quite meant to. I
wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you. And why
did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,
you turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes.
And I've looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking
every one about you. Your face haunted my heart. <q>He despises
me,</q> I thought; <q>he won't even look at me.</q> And I felt it so
much at last that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a
boy. I'll get him in my clutches and laugh at him. I was full of
spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody here dares talk or
think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose.
Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was
bound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has
been no one else. But looking at you, I thought, I'll get him in
my clutches and laugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am,
and you called me your sister! And now that man who wronged
<pb n='394'/><anchor id='Pg394'/>
me has come; I sit here waiting for a message from him. And do
you know what that man has been to me? Five years ago, when
Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one
might have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used
to sit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: <q>Where
is he now, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with
another woman, most likely. If only I could see him, if I could
meet him again, I'd pay him out, I'd pay him out!</q> At night I
used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the dark, and I used to brood
over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose and gloat over my anger.
<q>I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!</q> That's what I used to cry out
in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should really do
nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhaps
had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into
helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I
would get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole
world to pieces. And then what do you think? I began saving
money, I became hard-hearted, grew stout&mdash;grew wiser, would you
say? No, no one in the whole world sees it, no one knows it, but
when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did five years ago, when
I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all night, thinking,
<q>I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!</q> Do you hear? Well then, now
you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me&mdash;he was
coming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath
away; then I suddenly thought: <q>If he comes and whistles to call me,
I shall creep back to him like a beaten dog.</q> I couldn't believe myself.
Am I so abject? Shall I run to him or not? And I've been
in such a rage with myself all this month that I am worse than I
was five years ago. Do you see now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive
creature I am? I have shown you the whole truth! I played
with Mitya to keep me from running to that other. Hush, Rakitin,
it's not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to you. Before you
came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole
future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,
Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened
the day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world
knows what I am going through now, and no one ever can know....
<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>
For perhaps I shall take a knife with me to-day, I can't make
up my mind ...</q>
</p>

<p>
And at this <q>tragic</q> phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face
in her hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a
little child.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Misha,</q> he said, <q>don't be angry. She wounded you, but don't
be angry. You heard what she said just now? You mustn't ask
too much of human endurance, one must be merciful.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He
felt obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not
been there, he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked
at him ironically and Alyosha stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>You were so primed up with your elder's teaching last night
that now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!</q> said
Rakitin, with a smile of hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't laugh, Rakitin, don't smile, don't talk of the dead&mdash;he
was better than any one in the world!</q> cried Alyosha, with tears in
his voice. <q>I didn't speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the
judged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and
said to myself, <q>What does it matter?</q> in my cowardliness, but she,
after five years in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the
heart to her&mdash;it makes her forget everything, forgive everything, in
her tears! The man who has wronged her has come back, he sends
for her and she forgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to
meet him and she won't take a knife with her. She won't! No, I
am not like that. I don't know whether you are, Misha, but I am
not like that. It's a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....
Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us?
No, you haven't; if you had, you'd have understood her long ago ...
and the person insulted the day before yesterday must forgive
her, too! She will, when she knows ... and she shall know....
This soul is not yet at peace with itself, one must be tender with it ...
there may be a treasure in that soul....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his
ill-humor Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never
expected such a tirade from the gentle Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love
<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>
with her? Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk's really in love with
you, you've made a conquest!</q> he cried, with a coarse laugh.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha
with a tender smile shining on her tear-stained face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not
a person for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,</q> she turned to
Rakitin, <q>I meant to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but
now I don't want to. Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.</q> She
beckoned to him with a happy smile. <q>That's right, sit here. Tell
me,</q> she shook him by the hand and peeped into his face, smiling,
<q>tell me, do I love that man or not? the man who wronged me, do
I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here in the dark, asking
my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the time
has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have forgiven him already,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I really have forgiven him,</q> Grushenka murmured thoughtfully.
<q>What an abject heart! To my abject heart!</q> She snatched
up a glass from the table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air
and flung it on the floor. The glass broke with a crash. A little
cruel line came into her smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps I haven't forgiven him, though,</q> she said, with a sort of
menace in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as
though she were talking to herself. <q>Perhaps my heart is only getting
ready to forgive. I shall struggle with my heart. You see,
Alyosha, I've grown to love my tears in these five years....
Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I shouldn't care to be in his shoes,</q> hissed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you won't be, Rakitin, you'll never be in his shoes. You
shall black my shoes, Rakitin, that's the place you are fit for. You'll
never get a woman like me ... and he won't either, perhaps ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Won't he? Then why are you dressed up like that?</q> said Rakitin,
with a venomous sneer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don't know all
that is in my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I'll tear it off
at once, this minute,</q> she cried in a resonant voice. <q>You don't
know what that finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and
say: <q>Have you ever seen me look like this before?</q> He left me a
thin, consumptive cry-baby of seventeen. I'll sit by him, fascinate
<pb n='397'/><anchor id='Pg397'/>
him and work him up. <q>Do you see what I am like now?</q> I'll say
to him; <q>well, and that's enough for you, my dear sir, there's many
a slip twixt the cup and the lip!</q> That may be what the finery is
for, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh. <q>I'm
violent and resentful, Alyosha, I'll tear off my finery, I'll destroy
my beauty, I'll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn
beggar. If I choose, I won't go anywhere now to see any one. If I
choose, I'll send Kuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow,
and all his money and I'll go out charing for the rest of my life.
You think I wouldn't do it, Rakitin, that I would not dare to do it?
I would, I would, I could do it directly, only don't exasperate me ...
and I'll send him about his business, I'll snap my fingers
in his face, he shall never see me again!</q>
</p>

<p>
She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke
down again, hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and
shook with sobs.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's time we were off,</q> he said, <q>it's late, we shall be shut out of
the monastery.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka leapt up from her place.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha!</q> she cried, in mournful
surprise. <q>What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling,
tortured me, and now you'll leave me to face this night alone!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants
to, let him! I'll go alone,</q> Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, evil tongue!</q> Grushenka cried angrily at him; <q>you never
said such words to me as he has come to say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What has he said to you so special?</q> asked Rakitin irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he said to me,
it went straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the
first, the only one who has pitied me, that's what it is. Why did
you not come before, you angel?</q> She fell on her knees before him
as though in a sudden frenzy. <q>I've been waiting all my life for
some one like you, I knew that some one like you would come and
forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, some one would really
love me, not only with a shameful love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I done to you?</q> answered Alyosha, bending over
her with a tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; <q>I
<pb n='398'/><anchor id='Pg398'/>
only gave you an onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was
all!</q>
</p>

<p>
He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment
there was a sudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall.
Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily
into the room, crying out:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,</q> she cried,
breathless and joyful. <q>A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey
the driver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses....
A letter, here's the letter, mistress.</q>
</p>

<p>
A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while
she talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it
to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one
instant.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has sent for me,</q> she cried, her face white and distorted,
with a wan smile; <q>he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!</q>
</p>

<p>
But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly
the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go,</q> she cried; <q>five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by,
Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don't
let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don't
you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to
my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!</q>
</p>

<p>
She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, she has no thoughts for us now!</q> grumbled Rakitin.
<q>Let's go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick
of all these tears and cries.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood
a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were
running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being
led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the
bottom of the steps, Grushenka's bedroom window was suddenly
opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha:
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him
not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery.
And tell him, too, in my words: <q>Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel,
and not to you, noble heart.</q> And add, too, that Grushenka
loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him&mdash;so let
<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>
him remember that hour all his life&mdash;say, <q>Grushenka tells you to!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a
slam.
</p>

<p>
<q>H'm, h'm!</q> growled Rakitin, laughing, <q>she murders your
brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life! What
ferocity!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked
fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in
thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as
though he had been touched on an open wound. He had expected
something quite different by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha together.
Something very different from what he had hoped for had
happened.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a Pole, that officer of hers,</q> he began again, restraining
himself; <q>and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in
the customs in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some
puny little beggar of a Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He's
heard now that Grushenka's saved a little money, so he's turned up
again&mdash;that's the explanation of the mystery.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, so you've saved the sinner?</q> he laughed spitefully. <q>Have
you turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the
seven devils, eh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for
just now have come to pass!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Rakitin,</q> Alyosha answered with an aching heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've sold
my friend, you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am
not Judas.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it,</q> cried Alyosha,
<q>you remind me of it yourself....</q>
</p>

<p>
But this was the last straw for Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation take you all and each of you!</q> he cried suddenly,
<q>why the devil did I take you up? I don't want to know you from
this time forward. Go alone, there's your road!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha
alone in the dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked
across the fields to the monastery.

<head>Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee</head>

<p>
It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha
returned to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a
special entrance. It had struck nine o'clock&mdash;the hour of rest and
repose after a day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly
opened the door and went into the elder's cell where his coffin was
now standing. There was no one in the cell but Father Païssy,
reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice
Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's conversation and
the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep sound
sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father
Païssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.
Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his
knees and began to pray.
</p>

<p>
His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single
sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another
in a slow, continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart
and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw
that coffin before him, the hidden dead figure so precious to him,
but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning was no longer
aching in his soul. As soon as he came in, he fell down before the
coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy was glowing in his mind
and in his heart. The one window of the cell was open, the air
was fresh and cool. <q>So the smell must have become stronger, if
they opened the window,</q> thought Alyosha. But even this thought
of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and
humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him feel miserable
or indignant. He began quietly praying, but he soon felt that he
was praying almost mechanically. Fragments of thought floated
through his soul, flashed like stars and went out again at once, to
be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning in his soul a
sense of the wholeness of things&mdash;something steadfast and comforting&mdash;and
he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying
ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....
</p>

<pb n='401'/><anchor id='Pg401'/>

<p>
But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something
else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what
had interrupted it. He began listening to what Father Païssy was
reading, but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze.
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;</emph></q>
read Father Païssy. <q><emph>And the mother of Jesus was there; And both
Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marriage? What's that?... A marriage!</q> floated whirling
through Alyosha's mind. <q>There is happiness for her, too.... She
has gone to the feast.... No, she has not taken the knife....
That was only a tragic phrase.... Well ... tragic phrases should
be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases comfort the heart....
Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to bear. Rakitin
has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broods over
his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the
high road ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal,
and the sun is at the end of it.... Ah!... What's being
read?</q>...
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine</emph></q> ... Alyosha heard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn't want to miss it, I love
that passage: it's Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that
miracle! Ah, that sweet miracle! It was not men's grief, but
their joy Christ visited, He worked His first miracle to help men's
gladness.... <q>He who loves men loves their gladness, too</q> ...
He was always repeating that, it was one of his leading ideas....
<q>There's no living without joy,</q> Mitya says.... Yes, Mitya....
<q>Everything that is true and good is always full of forgiveness,</q> he
used to say that, too</q> ...
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or
me? Mine hour is not yet come.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
you, do it</emph></q> ...
</p>

<p>
<q>Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor,
people.... Of course they were poor, since they hadn't wine
enough even at a wedding.... The historians write that, in those
days, the people living about the Lake of Gennesaret were the poorest
that can possibly be imagined ... and another great heart,
<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>
that other great being, His Mother, knew that He had come not
only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that His heart
was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure
and unlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor
wedding. <q>Mine hour is not yet come,</q> He said, with a soft smile
(He must have smiled gently to her). And, indeed, was it to make
wine abundant at poor weddings He had come down to earth?
And yet He went and did as she asked Him.... Ah, he is
reading again</q>....
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor
of the feast. And they bare it.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew
the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
good wine; and when men have well drunk, that which is worse;
but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?...
Ah, yes ... It's the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of
course. Here are the guests, here are the young couple sitting,
and the merry crowd and ... Where is the wise governor of the
feast? But who is this? Who? Again the walls are receding....
Who is getting up there from the great table? What!... He
here, too? But he's in the coffin ... but he's here, too. He has
stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!</q>...
</p>

<p>
Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man,
with tiny wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There
was no coffin now, and he was in the same dress as he had worn
yesterday sitting with them, when the visitors had gathered about
him. His face was uncovered, his eyes were shining. How was this,
then? He, too, had been called to the feast. He, too, at the marriage
of Cana in Galilee....
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,</q> he heard a
soft voice saying over him. <q>Why have you hidden yourself here,
out of sight? You come and join us too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>

<p>
It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he,
since he called him!
</p>

<p>
The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are rejoicing,</q> the little, thin old man went on. <q>We are
drinking the new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see
how many guests? Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the
wise governor of the feast, he is tasting the new wine. Why do
you wonder at me? I gave an onion to a beggar, so I, too, am here.
And many here have given only an onion each&mdash;only one little
onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle one, you,
my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman
an onion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!...
Do you see our Sun, do you see Him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid ... I dare not look,</q> whispered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His
sublimity, but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto
us from love and rejoices with us. He is changing the water into
wine that the gladness of the guests may not be cut short. He is
expecting new guests, He is calling new ones unceasingly for ever
and ever.... There they are bringing new wine. Do you see they
are bringing the vessels....</q>
</p>

<p>
Something glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it till it
ached, tears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out
his hands, uttered a cry and waked up.
</p>

<p>
Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct
reading of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading.
It was strange, he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was
on his feet, and suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three
firm rapid steps he went right up to the coffin. His shoulder
brushed against Father Païssy without his noticing it. Father Païssy
raised his eyes for an instant from his book, but looked away again
at once, seeing that something strange was happening to the boy.
Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at the covered, motionless
dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on his breast
and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. He had
only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing in
his ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly
he turned sharply and went out of the cell.
</p>

<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>

<p>
He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his
soul, overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness.
The vault of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched
vast and fathomless above him. The Milky Way ran in two pale
streams from the zenith to the horizon. The fresh, motionless, still
night enfolded the earth. The white towers and golden domes of
the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire sky. The gorgeous
autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were slumbering till
morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the silence of
the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the
stars....
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the
earth. He did not know why he embraced it. He could not have
told why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he
kissed it weeping, sobbing and watering it with his tears, and vowed
passionately to love it, to love it for ever and ever. <q>Water the
earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears,</q> echoed in his
soul.
</p>

<p>
What was he weeping over?
</p>

<p>
Oh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which
were shining to him from the abyss of space, and <q>he was not
ashamed of that ecstasy.</q> There seemed to be threads from all those
innumerable worlds of God, linking his soul to them, and it was
trembling all over <q>in contact with other worlds.</q> He longed to
forgive every one and for everything, and to beg forgiveness. Oh,
not for himself, but for all men, for all and for everything. <q>And
others are praying for me too,</q> echoed again in his soul. But with
every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that something
firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his
soul. It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his
mind&mdash;and it was for all his life and for ever and ever. He had
fallen on the earth a weak boy, but he rose up a resolute champion,
and he knew and felt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy.
And never, never, all his life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some one visited my soul in that hour,</q> he used to say afterwards,
with implicit faith in his words.
</p>

<p>
Within three days he left the monastery in accordance with the
words of his elder, who had bidden him <q>sojourn in the world.</q>

<head>Chapter I. Kuzma Samsonov</head>

<p>
But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life,
had left her last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of
her love for ever, knew nothing of what had happened to her, and
was at that moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity.
For the last two days he had been in such an inconceivable
state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill with brain fever,
as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able to find
him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting
him at the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by
his orders, concealed his movements.
</p>

<p>
He had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,
<q>struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,</q> as he
expressed it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a
dash out of the town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him
to lose sight of Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained
afterwards in detail, and confirmed by documentary evidence; but
for the present we will only note the most essential incidents of
those two terrible days immediately preceding the awful catastrophe,
that broke so suddenly upon him.
</p>

<p>
Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely
and sincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and
mercilessly. The worst of it was that he could never tell what she
meant to do. To prevail upon her by force or kindness was also
impossible: she would yield to nothing. She would only have become
angry and turned away from him altogether, he knew that
well already. He suspected, quite correctly, that she, too, was passing
through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary
<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>
indecision, that she was making up her mind to something, and unable
to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he
divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate
him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing
Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting
question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly
persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered,
Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe
that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand
roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge
of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could
believe at times that all Grushenka's uneasiness rose from not knowing
which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to
think of the approaching return of the <q>officer,</q> that is, of the man
who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka's life, and whose
arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true
that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was
perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her
seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew,
too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had
shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly
any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.
Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle
with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining
any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did
not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up again after five years'
disappearance, still less in his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the <q>officer's</q>
first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility
of his new rival's visit was very vaguely suggested. The letter was
very indefinite, high-flown, and full of sentimentality. It must be
noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the
letter, in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had,
besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered afterwards, a certain
involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on
Grushenka's face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed
<pb n='407'/><anchor id='Pg407'/>
later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely
forgotten the officer's existence.
</p>

<p>
He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things
might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon
him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart
he was expecting every moment Grushenka's decision, always believing
that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment.
All of a sudden she would say to him: <q>Take me, I'm yours for ever,</q>
and it would all be over. He would seize her and bear her away
at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her away
at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia,
if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with
her incognito, so that no one would know anything about them,
there, here, or anywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin
at once!
</p>

<p>
Of this different, reformed and <q>virtuous</q> life (<q>it must, it
must be virtuous</q>) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He
thirsted for that reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in
which he had sunk of his own free will, was too revolting to him,
and, like very many men in such cases, he put faith above all in
change of place. If only it were not for these people, if only it
were not for these circumstances, if only he could fly away from
this accursed place&mdash;he would be altogether regenerated, would
enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and what he
was yearning for.
</p>

<p>
But all this could only be on condition of the first, the <emph>happy</emph>
solution of the question. There was another possibility, a different
and awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: <q>Go away. I
have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to
marry him and don't want you</q>&mdash;and then ... but then....
But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to the last
hour he didn't know. That must be said to his credit. He had no
definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching
and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy
solution of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But
for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental,
but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.
</p>

<p>
If she were to say to him: <q>I'm yours; take me away,</q> how could
<pb n='408'/><anchor id='Pg408'/>
he take her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it?
It was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor
Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption for so
many years, ceased. Grushenka had money, of course, but with
regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride; he
wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself,
at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive of taking
her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion.
I won't enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine
myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All
this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret
stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that
he had dishonestly appropriated. <q>I've been a scoundrel to one of
them, and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly,</q> was
his feeling then, as he explained after: <q>and when Grushenka knows,
she won't care for such a scoundrel.</q>
</p>

<p>
Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the
fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be
done, <q>and only because I hadn't the money. Oh, the shame of it!</q>
</p>

<p>
To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the
money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no
more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble,
I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that
sum he knew of, to <emph>have the right</emph> to take it, he must first restore
Katerina Ivanovna's three thousand&mdash;if not, <q>I'm a common pickpocket,
I'm a scoundrel, and I don't want to begin a new life as a
scoundrel,</q> Mitya decided. And so he made up his mind to move
heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand,
and that <emph>first of all</emph>. The final stage of this decision, so to say,
had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last
interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the
evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and
Mitya, after hearing Alyosha's account of it, had admitted that he
was a scoundrel, and told him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it
could be any comfort to her. After parting from his brother on that
night, he had felt in his frenzy that it would be better <q>to murder
and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to Katya. I'd rather
every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I'd rather go to
<pb n='409'/><anchor id='Pg409'/>
Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived
her and stole her money, and used her money to run away with
Grushenka and begin a new life! That I can't do!</q> So Mitya
decided, grinding his teeth, and he might well fancy at times that
his brain would give way. But meanwhile he went on struggling....
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing
left for him but despair&mdash;for what chance had he, with nothing
in the world, to raise such a sum?&mdash;yet to the very end he persisted
in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that the money
would somehow come to him of itself, as though it might drop from
heaven. That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have
never had anything to do with money, except to squander what
has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own,
and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most
fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he
had parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts
into a tangle of confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on
a perfectly wild enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in
such circumstances the most impossible, fantastic schemes occur
first, and seem most practical.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who
was Grushenka's protector, and to propose a <q>scheme</q> to him, and
by means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum
required. Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt,
not the slightest, and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look
upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from any but the
commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by
sight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a
word to him. But for some unknown reason he had long entertained
the conviction that the old reprobate, who was lying at
death's door, would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka's securing
a respectable position, and marrying a man <q>to be depended
upon.</q> And he believed not only that he would not object, but
that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that he
would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some
stray word of Grushenka's, he had gathered further that the old man
would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.
</p>

<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>

<p>
Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning
on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak,
from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness
and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon
Grushenka's past as something completely over. He looked on that
past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion
that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry
him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new
Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and
would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri
looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in
that remote past of Grushenka's, though she had never loved him,
and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with,
and, so to say, non-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon
him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that
he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had
changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that
this had been so for a long time.
</p>

<p>
In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya's part in all this,
for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It
was an instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded
that, being on the eve of his departure for the next world, old
Kuzma must sincerely repent of his past relations with Grushenka,
and that she had no more devoted friend and protector in the world
than this, now harmless old man.
</p>

<p>
After his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly
slept all night, and at ten o'clock next morning, he was at the
house of Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was
a very large and gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and
outhouses. In the lower story lived Samsonov's two married sons
with their families, his old sister, and his unmarried daughter. In the
lodge lived two of his clerks, one of whom also had a large family.
Both the lodge and the lower story were overcrowded, but the old
man kept the upper floor to himself, and would not even let the
daughter live there with him, though she waited upon him, and in
spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours, and at any
time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.
</p>

<p>
This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely
<pb n='411'/><anchor id='Pg411'/>
for show, furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long
monotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with
glass chandeliers under shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls.
All these rooms were entirely empty and unused, for the old man
kept to one room, a small, remote bedroom, where he was waited
upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her head, and by a lad,
who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to his swollen
legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only rarely lifted
from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting him led
him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and
taciturn even with this old woman.
</p>

<p>
When he was informed of the arrival of the <q>captain,</q> he at once
refused to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again.
Samsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like?
Whether he was drunk? Was he going to make a row? The answer
he received was: that he was sober, but wouldn't go away. The old
man again refused to see him. Then Mitya, who had foreseen this,
and purposely brought pencil and paper with him, wrote clearly
on the piece of paper the words: <q>On most important business closely
concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,</q> and sent it up to the old man.
</p>

<p>
After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor
to the drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a
summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This
younger son, a man over six foot and of exceptional physical
strength, who was closely-shaven and dressed in the European style,
though his father still wore a kaftan and a beard, came at once
without a comment. All the family trembled before the father.
The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of
the <q>captain</q> (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in
order to have a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by
his son and the servant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room.
It may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity. The
drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him was a vast, dreary
room that laid a weight of depression on the heart. It had a double
row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and three immense chandeliers
with glass lusters covered with shades.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his
fate with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the
<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>
opposite door, seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with
his long, military stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well
dressed, in a frock-coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black
gloves in his hands, just as he had been three days before at the
elder's, at the family meeting with his father and brothers. The old
man waited for him, standing dignified and unbending, and Mitya
felt at once that he had looked him through and through as he advanced.
Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's immensely
swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick,
hung down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in
dignified silence, motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and,
leaning on his son's arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa
opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his painful
exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of
his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he had
ventured to disturb.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it you want of me, sir?</q> said the old man, deliberately,
distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.
</p>

<p>
Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at
once speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive
frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on
the brink of ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he
failed. Old Samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant, though
his face remained cold and immovable as a statue's.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard
more than once of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Karamazov, who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother ...
seeing the whole town is gossiping about it ... for here
every one's gossiping of what they shouldn't ... and besides, it
might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your pardon,
through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna,
the lady for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...</q>
</p>

<p>
So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will
not reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize
the gist of it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention
(Mitya purposely used these words instead of <q>intentionally</q>)
consulted a lawyer in the chief town of the province, <q>a distinguished
lawyer, Kuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov.
<pb n='413'/><anchor id='Pg413'/>
You have perhaps heard of him? A man of vast intellect, the mind
of a statesman ... he knows you, too ... spoke of you in the
highest terms ...</q> Mitya broke down again. But these breaks
did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled
on and on.
</p>

<p>
This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting
the documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat
vaguely to these documents, and slurred over the subject with special
haste), reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning
the village of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have
come to him, Mitya, from his mother, and so checkmate the old
villain, his father ... <q>because every door was not closed and
justice might still find a loophole.</q> In fact, he might reckon on an
additional sum of six or even seven thousand roubles from Fyodor
Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least, twenty-five thousand,
he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact, <q>thirty, thirty,
Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn't get seventeen
from that heartless man!</q> So he, Mitya, had thrown the business
up, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming
here was struck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya
went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward), <q>so will
not you, excellent and honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take
up all my claims against that unnatural monster, and pay me a sum
down of only three thousand?... You see, you cannot, in any
case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear that. Quite
the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of three.</q>
Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll do the business with you at a notary's, or whatever it is ...
in fact, I'm ready to do anything.... I'll hand over all the deeds ...
whatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw
up the agreement at once ... and if it were possible, if it were only
possible, that very morning.... You could pay me that three
thousand, for there isn't a capitalist in this town to compare with
you, and so would save me from ... would save me, in fact ...
for a good, I might say an honorable action.... For I cherish the
most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you know well,
and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it had
not been as a father. And, indeed, it's a struggle of three in this
<pb n='414'/><anchor id='Pg414'/>
business, for it's fate&mdash;that's a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch!
A tragedy, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you've dropped
out long ago, it's a tug-of-war between two. I'm expressing it awkwardly,
perhaps, but I'm not a literary man. You see, I'm on the
one side, and that monster on the other. So you must choose. It's
either I or the monster. It all lies in your hands&mdash;the fate of three
lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse me, I'm making a mess
of it, but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes that
you understand ... and if you don't understand, I'm done for ...
so you see!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, <q>so you see!</q> and
jumping up from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal.
At the last phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware
that it had all fallen flat, above all, that he had been talking utter
nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<q>How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and
now it's nothing but nonsense.</q> The idea suddenly dawned on his
despairing mind. All the while he had been talking, the old man
sat motionless, watching him with an icy expression in his eyes.
After keeping him for a moment in suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch
pronounced at last in the most positive and chilling tone:
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, we don't undertake such business.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?</q> he muttered, with
a pale smile. <q>I suppose it's all up with me&mdash;what do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed
a movement in the old man's face. He started.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line,</q> said the old
man slowly. <q>There's the court, and the lawyers&mdash;it's a perfect
misery. But if you like, there is a man here you might apply to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,</q>
faltered Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>He doesn't live here, and he's not here just now. He is a peasant,
he does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He's been
haggling with Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse
at Tchermashnya. They can't agree on the price, maybe you've
heard? Now he's come back again and is staying with the priest at
<pb n='415'/><anchor id='Pg415'/>
Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the Volovya station. He wrote
to me, too, about the business of the copse, asking my advice.
Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if you
were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy
the offer you've made me, he might possibly&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A brilliant idea!</q> Mitya interrupted ecstatically. <q>He's the very
man, it would just suit him. He's haggling with him for it, being
asked too much, and here he would have all the documents entitling
him to the property itself. Ha ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling
Samsonov.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?</q> cried Mitya effusively.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't mention it,</q> said Samsonov, inclining his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you don't know, you've saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment
brought me to you.... So now to this priest!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No need of thanks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll make haste and fly there. I'm afraid I've overtaxed your
strength. I shall never forget it. It's a Russian says that, Kuzma
Kuzmitch, a R-r-russian!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant
gleam in the old man's eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once
blamed himself for his mistrustfulness.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's because he's tired,</q> he thought.
</p>

<p>
<q>For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand
that it's for her,</q> he cried, his voice ringing through the room.
He bowed, turned sharply round, and with the same long stride
walked to the door without looking back. He was trembling with
delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel
saved me,</q> was the thought in his mind. And if such a business
man as Samsonov (a most worthy old man, and what dignity!)
had suggested this course, then ... then success was assured. He
would fly off immediately. <q>I will be back before night, I shall be
back at night and the thing is done. Could the old man have been
laughing at me?</q> exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards his lodging.
He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was
<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>
practical <q>from such a business man</q> with an understanding of the
business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!).
Or&mdash;the old man was laughing at him.
</p>

<p>
Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards,
when the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself
confessed, laughing, that he had made a fool of the <q>captain.</q> He
was a cold, spiteful and sarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies.
Whether it was the <q>captain's</q> excited face, or the foolish conviction
of the <q>rake and spendthrift,</q> that he, Samsonov, could be
taken in by such a cock-and-bull story as his scheme, or his jealousy
of Grushenka, in whose name this <q>scapegrace</q> had rushed in on
him with such a tale to get money which worked on the old man,
I can't tell. But at the instant when Mitya stood before him, feeling
his legs grow weak under him, and frantically exclaiming that
he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him with
intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. When
Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his
son and bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and
never admitted even into the yard, or else he'd&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw
him enraged, trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the
old man was shaking with anger, and by evening he was worse, and
sent for the doctor.
</p>

<head>Chapter II. Lyagavy</head>

<p>
So he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for
horses. He had forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was
left after so many years of prosperity! But he had at home an old
silver watch which had long ceased to go. He snatched it up and
carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who had a shop in the market-place.
The Jew gave him six roubles for it.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I didn't expect that,</q> cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was
still in a state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home.
At home he borrowed three roubles from the people of the house,
<pb n='417'/><anchor id='Pg417'/>
who loved him so much that they were pleased to give it him, though
it was all they had. Mitya in his excitement told them on the spot
that his fate would be decided that day, and he described, in desperate
haste, the whole scheme he had put before Samsonov, the
latter's decision, his own hopes for the future, and so on. These
people had been told many of their lodger's secrets before, and so
looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud, and
almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles
Mitya sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station.
This was how the fact came to be remembered and established that
<q>at midday, on the day before the event, Mitya had not a farthing,
and that he had sold his watch to get money and had borrowed three
roubles from his landlord, all in the presence of witnesses.</q>
</p>

<p>
I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.
</p>

<p>
Though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would
at last solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station,
he trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in
his absence. What if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor
Pavlovitch? This was why he had gone off without telling her
and why he left orders with his landlady not to let out where he
had gone, if any one came to inquire for him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must, I must get back to-night,</q> he repeated, as he was jolted
along in the cart, <q>and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy
back here ... to draw up the deed.</q> So mused Mitya, with a
throbbing heart, but alas! his dreams were not fated to be carried
out.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya
station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve.
Secondly, he did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had
gone off to a neighboring village. While Mitya, setting off there
with the same exhausted horses, was looking for him, it was almost
dark.
</p>

<p>
The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him
at once that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he
was now at Suhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the
forester's cottage, as he was buying timber there too. At Mitya's
urgent request that he would take him to Lyagavy at once, and by
so doing <q>save him, so to speak,</q> the priest agreed, after some
<pb n='418'/><anchor id='Pg418'/>
demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his curiosity was obviously
aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on foot, as
it would not be <q>much over</q> a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed, and
marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost
ran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.
</p>

<p>
Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously
and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all
the way. The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He
turned off Mitya's questions with: <q>I don't know. Ah, I can't say.
How can I tell?</q> and so on. When Mitya began to speak of his
quarrel with his father over his inheritance, the priest was positively
alarmed, as he was in some way dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch.
He inquired, however, with surprise, why he called the peasant-trader
Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained to Mitya that,
though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he was never called so,
as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he must
be sure to call him Gorstkin, <q>or you'll do nothing with him; he
won't even listen to you,</q> said the priest in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that
that was what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the
priest dropped the subject, though he would have done well to put
into words his doubt whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that
peasant, calling him Lyagavy, there was not something wrong about
it and he was turning him into ridicule. But Mitya had no time
to pause over such trifles. He hurried, striding along, and only
when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize that they had come
not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three. This annoyed
him, but he controlled himself.
</p>

<p>
They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the
hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the
other side of the passage. They went into that room and lighted a
tallow candle. The hut was extremely overheated. On the table
there was a samovar that had gone out, a tray with cups, an empty
rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and some half-eaten crusts
of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched at full length
on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow,
snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I've
<pb n='419'/><anchor id='Pg419'/>
come in such haste. I'm in a hurry to get back to-day,</q> he said in
great agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not
giving their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake
him himself; he tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's drunk,</q> Mitya decided. <q>Good Lord! What am I to do?
What am I to do?</q> And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him
by the arms, by the legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making
him sit on the bench. Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only
succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and
violent, but inarticulate oaths.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you'd better wait a little,</q> the priest pronounced at last,
<q>for he's obviously not in a fit state.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's been drinking the whole day,</q> the forester chimed in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens!</q> cried Mitya. <q>If only you knew how important
it is to me and how desperate I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you'd better wait till morning,</q> the priest repeated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible!</q>
</p>

<p>
And in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping
man again, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his
efforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
</p>

<p>
<q>What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,</q> said Mitya,
in complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face.
The priest seized the moment to put before him, very reasonably,
that, even if he succeeded in wakening the man, he would still be
drunk and incapable of conversation. <q>And your business is important,</q>
he said, <q>so you'd certainly better put it off till morning.</q>
With a gesture of despair Mitya agreed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable
moment. As soon as he wakes I'll begin. I'll pay you for the light,</q>
he said to the forester, <q>for the night's lodging, too; you'll remember
Dmitri Karamazov. Only, Father, I don't know what we're to
do with you. Where will you sleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I'm going home. I'll take his horse and get home,</q> he
said, indicating the forester. <q>And now I'll say good-by. I wish
you all success.</q>
</p>

<p>
So it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester's horse, delighted
to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering
whether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>
Pavlovitch of this curious incident, <q>or he may in an unlucky hour
hear of it, be angry, and withdraw his favor.</q>
</p>

<p>
The forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without
a word, and Mitya sat on the bench to <q>catch the favorable moment,</q>
as he expressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul
like a heavy mist. A profound, intense dejection! He sat thinking,
but could reach no conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket
chirped; it became insufferably close in the overheated room. He
suddenly pictured the garden, the path behind the garden, the door
of his father's house mysteriously opening and Grushenka running
in. He leapt up from the bench.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a tragedy!</q> he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he
went up to the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean,
middle-aged peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long,
thin, reddish beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat,
from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch.
Mitya looked at his face with intense hatred, and for some unknown
reason his curly hair particularly irritated him.
</p>

<p>
What was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things
of such importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly
worn out, should with business of such urgency be standing over this
dolt on whom his whole fate depended, while he snored as though
there were nothing the matter, as though he'd dropped from another
planet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, the irony of fate!</q> cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head,
he fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a
sort of ferocity, pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but
after five minutes of vain exertions, he returned to his bench in
helpless despair, and sat down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stupid! Stupid!</q> cried Mitya. <q>And how dishonorable it all
is!</q> something made him add. His head began to ache horribly.
<q>Should he fling it up and go away altogether?</q> he wondered. <q>No,
wait till to-morrow now. I'll stay on purpose. What else did I
come for? Besides, I've no means of going. How am I to get away
from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!</q>
</p>

<p>
But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and
unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to
have slept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head
<pb n='421'/><anchor id='Pg421'/>
aching so unbearably that he could have screamed. There was a
hammering in his temples, and the top of his head ached. It was a
long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had
happened to him.
</p>

<p>
At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from
the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken
peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go
out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the
forester's room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that
the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance,
accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go
to see to it.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he's dead, he's dead! and ... what am I to do then?</q> cried
Mitya frantically.
</p>

<p>
They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney.
Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted
his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the
water, and put it on Lyagavy's head. The forester still treated the
matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said
grumpily:
</p>

<p>
<q>It'll be all right, now.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya
fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head,
and gravely resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out
that when he sat down for a moment to take breath, he closed his
eyes, unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and
slept like the dead.
</p>

<p>
It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about
nine o'clock. The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows
of the hut. The curly-headed peasant was sitting on the
bench and had his coat on. He had another samovar and another
bottle in front of him. Yesterday's bottle had already been finished,
and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya jumped up and
saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again, hopelessly and
incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened eyes.
The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting
composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so
Mitya fancied. He rushed up to him.
</p>

<pb n='422'/><anchor id='Pg422'/>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, you see ... I ... you've most likely heard from
the forester here in the hut. I'm Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov,
the son of the old Karamazov whose copse you are buying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a lie!</q> said the peasant, calmly and confidently.
</p>

<p>
<q>A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,</q> said the peasant,
speaking thickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do
wake up, and collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought
me here. You wrote to Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,</q>
Mitya gasped breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're l-lying!</q> Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya's legs
went cold.
</p>

<p>
<q>For mercy's sake! It isn't a joke! You're drunk, perhaps. Yet
you can speak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a painter!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For mercy's sake! I'm Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have
an offer to make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous
offer, concerning the copse!</q>
</p>

<p>
The peasant stroked his beard importantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you've contracted for the job and turned out a scamp.
You're a scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you you're mistaken,</q> cried Mitya, wringing his hands
in despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed
up his eyes cunningly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery.
D'you hear? You're a scoundrel! Do you understand that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly <q>something seemed to
hit him on the head,</q> as he said afterwards. In an instant a light
seemed to dawn in his mind, <q>a light was kindled and I grasped it
all.</q> He stood, stupefied, wondering how he, after all a man of
intelligence, could have yielded to such folly, have been led into
such an adventure, and have kept it up for almost twenty-four
hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the man's drunk, dead drunk, and he'll go on drinking
now for a week; what's the use of waiting here? And what if
<pb n='423'/><anchor id='Pg423'/>
Samsonov sent me here on purpose? What if she&mdash;? Oh, God,
what have I done?</q>
</p>

<p>
The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya
might have killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a
child. He went quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it
on without a word, and went out of the hut. He did not find the
forester in the next room; there was no one there. He took fifty
kopecks in small change out of his pocket and put them on the
table for his night's lodging, the candle, and the trouble he had
given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all round.
He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the
hut, to the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before
with the priest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful
feeling for anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode
along a narrow forest path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where
he was going. A child could have knocked him down, so weak was
he in body and soul. He got out of the forest somehow, however,
and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest, stretched as far as the
eye could see.
</p>

<p>
<q>What despair! What death all round!</q> he repeated, striding
on and on.
</p>

<p>
He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven
across country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya
asked the way, and it turned out that the old merchant, too, was
going to Volovya. After some discussion Mitya got into the trap.
Three hours later they arrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered
posting-horses to drive to the town, and suddenly realized that he
was appallingly hungry. While the horses were being harnessed,
an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an instant, ate a
huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three glasses of
vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He
flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a
new and <q>unalterable</q> plan to procure that <q>accursed money</q> before
evening. <q>And to think, only to think that a man's life should
be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!</q> he cried, contemptuously.
<q>I'll settle it to-day.</q> And if it had not been for
the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her,
which never left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful
<pb n='424'/><anchor id='Pg424'/>
again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart
every moment, like a sharp knife.
</p>

<p>
At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to
Rakitin with such horror. She was just then expecting the
<q>message,</q> and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see
her that day or the day before. She hoped that <q>please God he won't
come till I'm gone away,</q> and he suddenly burst in on her. The
rest we know already. To get him off her hands she suggested at
once that he should walk with her to Samsonov's, where she said
she absolutely must go <q>to settle his accounts,</q> and when Mitya
accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, making
him promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her home again.
Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting
at Samsonov's she could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, <q>if
only she's not lying,</q> he added at once. But he thought she was
not lying from what he saw.
</p>

<p>
He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved
woman, at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be
happening to her, and how she may be betraying him, but, when
shaken, heartbroken, convinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to
her; at the first glance at her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate
face, he revives at once, lays aside all suspicion and with joyful
shame abuses himself for his jealousy.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he
had so much still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from
his heart, anyway.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov
whether anything happened there last night, whether, by any chance,
she went to Fyodor Pavlovitch; ough!</q> floated through his mind.
</p>

<p>
Before he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up
again in his restless heart.
</p>

<pb n='425'/><anchor id='Pg425'/>

<p>
Jealousy! <q>Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,</q> observed
Pushkin. And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight
of our great poet. Othello's soul was shattered and his whole
outlook clouded simply because <emph>his ideal was destroyed</emph>. But Othello
did not begin hiding, spying, peeping. He was trustful, on the
contrary. He had to be led up, pushed on, excited with great difficulty
before he could entertain the idea of deceit. The truly jealous
man is not like that. It is impossible to picture to oneself the shame
and moral degradation to which the jealous man can descend without
a qualm of conscience. And yet it's not as though the jealous
were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man of lofty
feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet hide
under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the lowest
ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.
</p>

<p>
Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness&mdash;not
incapable of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it&mdash;though
his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe's. It
is not so with the really jealous man. It is hard to imagine what
some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook, and
what they can forgive! The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive,
and all women know it. The jealous man can forgive extraordinarily
quickly (though, of course, after a violent scene), and he
is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved, the very
kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be convinced
that it has all been <q>for the last time,</q> and that his rival
will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the
earth, or that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that
dreaded rival will not get near her. Of course the reconciliation
is only for an hour. For, even if the rival did disappear next day,
he would invent another one and would be jealous of him. And one
might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so watched
over, what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous guarding.
But that the jealous will never understand. And yet among
them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those very
men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening
and spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment,
anyway, though they understand clearly enough with their <q>noble
hearts</q> the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.
</p>

<pb n='426'/><anchor id='Pg426'/>

<p>
At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya's jealousy vanished, and, for an
instant he became trustful and generous, and positively despised
himself for his evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love
for the woman, there was an element of something far higher than
he himself imagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only
the <q>curve of her body,</q> of which he had talked to Alyosha. But,
as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all
the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience
at it.
</p>

<p>
And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to
make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least
a small, temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost
all gone on his expedition. And, as we all know, one can't take a
step without money. But he had thought over in the cart where
he could get a loan. He had a brace of fine dueling pistols in a case,
which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above
all his possessions.
</p>

<p>
In the <q>Metropolis</q> tavern he had some time since made acquaintance
with a young official and had learnt that this very
opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons. He used to
buy pistols, revolvers, daggers, hang them on his wall and show them
to acquaintances. He prided himself on them, and was quite a
specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya, without stopping
to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his pistols
to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying to
persuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent,
so the young man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing
would induce him to take interest. They parted friends.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch's by
the back way, to his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as
possible. In this way the fact was established that three or four
hours before a certain event, of which I shall speak later on, Mitya
had not a farthing, and pawned for ten roubles a possession he
valued, though, three hours later, he was in possession of thousands....
But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna (the
woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch's) he learned the very disturbing
fact of Smerdyakov's illness. He heard the story of his
fall in the cellar, his fit, the doctor's visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch's
<pb n='427'/><anchor id='Pg427'/>
anxiety; he heard with interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set
off that morning for Moscow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,</q> thought
Dmitri, but he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. <q>What
will happen now? Who'll keep watch for me? Who'll bring me
word?</q> he thought. He began greedily questioning the women
whether they had seen anything the evening before. They quite
understood what he was trying to find out, and completely reassured
him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been
there the night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya
grew thoughtful. He would certainly have to keep watch to-day,
but where? Here or at Samsonov's gate? He decided that he must
be on the look out both here and there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile....
The difficulty was that he had to carry out the new
plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure of its
success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved to
sacrifice an hour to it: <q>In an hour I shall know everything, I shall
settle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov's. I'll
inquire whether Grushenka's there and instantly be back here again,
stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov's again to bring her home.</q>
This was what he decided.
</p>

<p>
He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes,
dressed, and went to Madame Hohlakov's. Alas! he had built his
hopes on her. He had resolved to borrow three thousand from that
lady. And what was more, he felt suddenly convinced that she
would not refuse to lend it to him. It may be wondered why, if he
felt so certain, he had not gone to her at first, one of his own sort,
so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he did not know, who
was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how to speak.
</p>

<p>
But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov
well, and had seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he
knew she could not endure him. She had detested him from the
first because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she had,
for some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna
should throw him over, and marry the <q>charming, chivalrously
refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.</q> Mitya's manners
she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had once said
about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was uncultivated.
<pb n='428'/><anchor id='Pg428'/>
But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck
him: <q>If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna</q>
(and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) <q>why
should she refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me
to leave Katya and get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine
ladies, if they set their hearts on anything, will spare no expense to
satisfy their caprice. Besides, she's so rich,</q> Mitya argued.
</p>

<p>
As for his <q>plan</q> it was just the same as before; it consisted of the
offer of his rights to Tchermashnya&mdash;but not with a commercial
object, as it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady
with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand&mdash;but
simply as a security for the debt. As he worked out this new
idea, Mitya was enchanted with it, but so it always was with him
in all his undertakings, in all his sudden decisions. He gave himself
up to every new idea with passionate enthusiasm. Yet, when he
mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov's house he felt a shiver of
fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as a mathematical
certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this broke down,
nothing else was left him in the world, but to <q>rob and murder
some one for the three thousand.</q> It was half-past seven when he
rang at the bell.
</p>

<p>
At first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was
announced he was received with extraordinary rapidity. <q>As though
she were waiting for me,</q> thought Mitya, and as soon as he had
been led to the drawing-room, the lady of the house herself ran in,
and declared at once that she was expecting him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I'd no
reason to suppose you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself.
Yet, I did expect you. You may marvel at my instinct,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was convinced all the morning that you
would come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is certainly wonderful, madam,</q> observed Mitya, sitting
down limply, <q>but I have come to you on a matter of great importance....
On a matter of supreme importance for me, that is,
madam ... for me alone ... and I hasten&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you've come on most important business, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch; it's not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking
back to the miraculous (have you heard about Father Zossima?).
<pb n='429'/><anchor id='Pg429'/>
This is a case of mathematics: you couldn't help coming, after all
that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna; you couldn't, you couldn't,
that's a mathematical certainty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The realism of actual life, madam, that's what it is. But allow
me to explain&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm all for realism now.
I've seen too much of miracles. You've heard that Father Zossima
is dead?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, madam, it's the first time I've heard of it.</q> Mitya was
a little surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Last night, and only imagine&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam,</q> said Mitya, <q>I can imagine nothing except that I'm
in a desperate position, and that if you don't help me, everything
will come to grief, and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality
of the expression, but I'm in a fever&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, I know that you're in a fever. You could hardly fail
to be, and whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have
long been thinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am
watching over it and studying it.... Oh, believe me, I'm an experienced
doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I'm certainly an experienced
patient,</q> said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, <q>and I
feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you will
come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to
you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and
what I am hoping of you.... I have come, madam&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't explain it. It's of secondary importance. But as for help,
you're not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have
most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband
was ruined, <q>had come to grief,</q> as you characteristically express it,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I recommended him to take to horse-breeding,
and now he's doing well. Have you any idea of horse-breeding,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!</q> cried
Mitya, in nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. <q>I
simply implore you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two
minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything,
the whole plan with which I have come. Besides, I am short of
<pb n='430'/><anchor id='Pg430'/>
time. I'm in a fearful hurry,</q> Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that
she was just going to begin talking again, and hoping to cut her
short. <q>I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of despair,
to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on
safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!
Only let me explain&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!</q> Madame
Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn, <q>and whatever
you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I've told you so
already. You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can
give you more, immeasurably more, I will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
but you must listen to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya started from his seat again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, will you really be so good!</q> he cried, with strong feeling.
<q>Good God, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a
violent death, from a bullet.... My eternal gratitude&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!</q> cried
Madame Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Infinitely? But I don't need so much. I only need that fatal
three thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum
with infinite gratitude, and I propose a plan which&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it's said and done.</q> Madame
Hohlakov cut him short, with the modest triumph of beneficence:
<q>I have promised to save you, and I will save you. I will save you
as I did Belmesov. What do you think of the gold-mines, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything
about them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over
and over again. I have been watching you for the last month. I've
watched you a hundred times as you've walked past, saying to myself:
That's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold-mines.
I've studied your gait and come to the conclusion: that's a man who
would find gold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From my gait, madam?</q> said Mitya, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can
be told from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the
idea. I'm all for science and realism now. After all this business
<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>
with Father Zossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I'm
a realist and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness. I'm
cured. <q>Enough!</q> as Turgenev says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to
lend me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> Madame Hohlakov cut in
at once. <q>The money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand,
but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time.
I'll make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold-mines, make
millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and
lead us to better things. Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You
will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help
the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch. You'll become famous and indispensable to the Department
of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The depreciation
of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;
people don't know that side of me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, madam!</q> Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment.
<q>I shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice,
madam.... I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold-mines....
I'll come and see you again about it ... many times, indeed ...
but now, that three thousand you so generously ... oh, that would
set me free, and if you could to-day ... you see, I haven't a minute,
a minute to lose to-day&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!</q> Madame Hohlakov interrupted
emphatically. <q>The question is, will you go to the gold-mines
or not; have you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or
no.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go, madam, afterwards.... I'll go where you like ...
but now&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running
to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling
out one drawer after another, looking for something with desperate
haste.
</p>

<p>
<q>The three thousand,</q> thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping,
<q>and at the instant ... without any papers or formalities ...
that's doing things in gentlemanly style! She's a splendid woman,
if only she didn't talk so much!</q>
</p>

<pb n='432'/><anchor id='Pg432'/>

<p>
<q>Here!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya,
<q>here is what I was looking for!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next
the skin with a cross.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> she went on reverently,
<q>from the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it
on your neck myself, and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new
career.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging
it. In extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped
her, and at last he got it under his neck-tie and collar through his
shirt to his chest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now you can set off,</q> Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting
down triumphantly in her place again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, I am so touched. I don't know how to thank you, indeed ...
for such kindness, but ... If only you knew how
precious time is to me.... That sum of money, for which I shall
be indebted to your generosity.... Oh, madam, since you are so
kind, so touchingly generous to me,</q> Mitya exclaimed impulsively,
<q>then let me reveal to you ... though, of course, you've known it
a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have been false
to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I've behaved
inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with
another woman ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise,
for you know everything already, but whom I cannot leave on any
account, and therefore that three thousand now&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> Madame Hohlakov interrupted
in the most decisive tone. <q>Leave everything, especially
women. Gold-mines are your goal, and there's no place for women
there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous, you will
find the girl of your heart in the highest society. That will be a
modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By that time
the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and the new
woman will have appeared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, that's not the point, not at all....</q> Mitya clasped
his hands in entreaty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very
thing you're yearning for, though you don't realize it yourself. I
<pb n='433'/><anchor id='Pg433'/>
am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch. The development of woman, and even the political
emancipation of woman in the near future&mdash;that's my ideal. I've
a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don't know that
side of me. I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that
subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the vocation
of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two
lines: <q>I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.
Persevere.</q> And I signed myself, <q>A Mother.</q> I thought of signing
myself <q>A contemporary Mother,</q> and hesitated, but I stuck to the
simple <q>Mother</q>; there's more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
And the word <q>contemporary</q> might have reminded him of
<q><hi rend='italic'>The Contemporary</hi></q>&mdash;a painful recollection owing to the
censorship.... Good Heavens, what is the matter!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam!</q> cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands
before her in helpless entreaty. <q>You will make me weep if you
delay what you have so generously&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That's a noble
feeling ... such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease
your heart, and later on you will return rejoicing. You will hasten
to me from Siberia on purpose to share your joy with me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But allow me, too!</q> Mitya cried suddenly. <q>For the last time I
entreat you, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day,
if not, when may I come for it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven't got three thousand,</q>
Madame Hohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya
was stupefied.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as
good as in my hands&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that
case you misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. It's
true I promised you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I
remember it all now, but I was referring to the gold-mines.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the money? The three thousand?</q> Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.
</p>

<pb n='434'/><anchor id='Pg434'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, if you meant money, I haven't any. I haven't a penny,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm quarreling with my steward about it,
and I've just borrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself.
No, no, I've no money. And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
if I had, I wouldn't give it to you. In the first place I never lend
money. Lending money means losing friends. And I wouldn't give
it to you particularly. I wouldn't give it you, because I like you
and want to save you, for all you need is the gold-mines, the gold-mines,
the gold-mines!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, the devil!</q> roared Mitya, and with all his might brought
his fist down on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! Aie!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew
to the other end of the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out
of the house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one
possessed, and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he
had struck himself two days previously, before Alyosha, the last
time he saw him in the dark, on the road. What those blows upon
his breast signified, <emph>on that spot</emph>, and what he meant by it&mdash;that
was, for the time, a secret which was known to no one in the
world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that secret
meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he
had determined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that
would pay his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his
breast, from <emph>that spot on his breast</emph>, the shame he carried upon it,
that weighed on his conscience. All this will be fully explained
to the reader later on, but now that his last hope had vanished, this
man, so strong in appearance, burst out crying like a little child
a few steps from the Hohlakovs' house. He walked on, and not
knowing what he was doing, wiped away his tears with his fist.
In this way he reached the square, and suddenly became aware that
he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercing wail from
an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Lord, you've nearly killed me! Why don't you look where
you're going, scapegrace?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's you!</q> cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the
dark. It was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom
Mitya had particularly noticed the day before.
</p>

<pb n='435'/><anchor id='Pg435'/>

<p>
<q>And who are you, my good sir?</q> said the old woman, in quite a
different voice. <q>I don't know you in the dark.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. You're the servant there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch's.... But I
don't know you now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there
now?</q> said Mitya, beside himself with suspense. <q>I saw her to the
house some time ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What? Went away?</q> cried Mitya. <q>When did she go?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only
told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she
ran away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're lying, damn you!</q> roared Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! Aie!</q> shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.
</p>

<p>
He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived.
At the moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe.
It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure.
</p>

<p>
Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona,
in the kitchen when <q>the captain</q> ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing
shriek on seeing him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You scream?</q> roared Mitya, <q>where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a
word, he fell all of a heap at her feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fenya, for Christ's sake, tell me, where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don't know.
You may kill me but I can't tell you.</q> Fenya swore and protested.
<q>You went out with her yourself not long ago&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She came back!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Indeed she didn't. By God I swear she didn't come back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're lying!</q> shouted Mitya. <q>From your terror I know
where she is.</q>
</p>

<p>
He rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off
so easily. But she knew very well that it was only that he was in
such haste, or she might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he
surprised both Fenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action.
On the table stood a brass mortar, with a pestle in it, a small brass
<pb n='436'/><anchor id='Pg436'/>
pestle, not much more than six inches long. Mitya already had
opened the door with one hand when, with the other, he snatched
up the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, Lord! He's going to murder some one!</q> cried Fenya, flinging
up her hands.

<p>
Where was he running? <q>Where could she be except at
Fyodor Pavlovitch's? She must have run straight to him
from Samsonov's, that was clear now. The whole intrigue, the
whole deceit was evident.</q> ... It all rushed whirling through his
mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna's. <q>There was no
need to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no
alarm ... they would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna
was clearly in the plot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had
been bought over!</q>
</p>

<p>
He formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round
Fyodor Pavlovitch's house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky
Street, then over the little bridge, and so came straight to
the deserted alley at the back, which was empty and uninhabited,
with, on one side the hurdle fence of a neighbor's kitchen-garden,
on the other the strong high fence, that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch's
garden. Here he chose a spot, apparently the very place,
where according to the tradition, he knew Lizaveta had once climbed
over it: <q>If she could climb over it,</q> the thought, God knows why,
occurred to him, <q>surely I can.</q> He did in fact jump up, and instantly
contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence. Then he
vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, in
the garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he could see
the lighted windows of the house too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She's there!</q> and he
leapt from the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory
was ill and very likely Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one
to hear him, he instinctively hid himself, stood still, and began to
<pb n='437'/><anchor id='Pg437'/>
listen. But there was dead silence on all sides and, as though of
design, complete stillness, not the slightest breath of wind.
</p>

<p>
<q>And naught but the whispering silence,</q> the line for some reason
rose to his mind. <q>If only no one heard me jump over the fence!
I think not.</q> Standing still for a minute, he walked softly over the
grass in the garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked
slowly, creeping stealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps.
It took him five minutes to reach the lighted window. He
remembered that just under the window there were several thick
and high bushes of elder and whitebeam. The door from the house
into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut; he had carefully
looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached the bushes
and hid behind them. He held his breath. <q>I must wait now,</q> he
thought, <q>to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are
listening ... if only I don't cough or sneeze.</q>
</p>

<p>
He waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at
moments, he could scarcely breathe. <q>No, this throbbing at my
heart won't stop,</q> he thought. <q>I can't wait any longer.</q> He was
standing behind a bush in the shadow. The light of the window fell
on the front part of the bush.
