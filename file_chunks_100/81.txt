discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him for
his children's education (though the latter never directly refused
but only procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was,
indeed, at times effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a
personal interest in the orphans. He became especially fond of the
younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as one of his family.
I beg the reader to note this from the beginning. And to Yefim
Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met
with, the young people were more indebted for their education and
bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand roubles
left to them by the general's widow intact, so that by the time they
came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation
of interest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly
spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them.
I won't enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth,
but will only mention a few of the most important events. Of the
elder, Ivan, I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose
and reserved, though far from timid boy. At ten years old he
had realized that they were living not in their own home but on
other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it
was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his
infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude
for learning. I don't know precisely why, but he left the
family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering
a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated
teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to
<pb n='011'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>
declare afterwards that this was all due to the <q>ardor for good
works</q> of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that
the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But
neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young
man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As
Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the
tyrannical old lady's legacy, which had grown from one thousand to
two, it was delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and
the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the
university, as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was
studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate
with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for
him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that
from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that
may have been, the young man was by no means despondent and
succeeded in getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and
afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers
under the signature of <q>Eye-Witness.</q> These paragraphs,
it was said, were so interesting and piquant that they were soon
taken. This alone showed the young man's practical and intellectual
superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of
both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals,
unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for
copying and translations from the French. Having once got into
touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept up his connection
with them, and in his latter years at the university he published
brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so
that he became well known in literary circles. But only in his
last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a
far wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and
remembered him. It was rather a curious incident. When he had
just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two
thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more
important journals a strange article, which attracted general notice,
on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing,
as he was a student of natural science. The article dealt with
a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time&mdash;the
position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions
<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>
on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was
most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected
conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly
as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even
atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons
opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical
burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article
penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where
the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the
ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning
the author's name, they were interested in his being a native of
the town and the son of <q>that Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q> And just then
it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.
</p>

<p>
Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking
myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit,
which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never
fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that
a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious,
should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had
ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him,
and would not under any circumstances have given him money,
though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would
also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying
in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two
months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact
was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me.
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi√ºsov, of whom we have spoken already,
the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, happened to be in the
neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had come from
Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was
more surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the
young man, who interested him extremely, and with whom he
sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself
in acquirements.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is proud,</q> he used to say, <q>he will never be in want of pence;
he has got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want
here? Every one can see that he hasn't come for money, for his
father would never give him any. He has no taste for drink and
<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>
dissipation, and yet his father can't do without him. They get on
so well together!</q>
</p>

<p>
That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence
over his father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently
and even seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often
extremely and even spitefully perverse.
</p>

<p>
It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at
the request of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri,
whom he saw for the first time on this very visit, though he had
before leaving Moscow been in correspondence with him about an
important matter of more concern to Dmitri than himself. What
that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even
when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan
Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather
mysterious.
</p>

<p>
I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a
mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was
in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action
against him.
</p>

<p>
The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some
of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger
brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been
the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find
it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give
some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact,
which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing
the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been for the last year in our
monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest
of his life.

<head>Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha</head>

<p>
He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth
year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven.
First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha,
was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning.
He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the
monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to
say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of
worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason this life
struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as he
thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to
whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent
heart. But I do not dispute that he was very strange even at that
time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I have mentioned
already, by the way, that though he lost his mother in his fourth
year he remembered her all his life&mdash;her face, her caresses, <q>as though
she stood living before me.</q> Such memories may persist, as every
one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but
scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out
of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all
faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was
with him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open
window, the slanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most
vividly of all); in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a
lighted lamp, and on her knees before the image his mother, sobbing
hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him up in both arms,
squeezing him close till it hurt, and praying for him to the Mother
of God, holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put
him under the Mother's protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs
in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the picture!
And Alyosha remembered his mother's face at that minute. He used
to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he
rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood
and youth he was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed,
but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary,
from something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely
personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important to
him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it.
But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life to put
implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton
or na√Øve person. There was something about him which made
one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
not care to be a judge of others&mdash;that he would never take it upon
himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything.
He seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation
though often grieving bitterly: and this was so much
so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest
youth. Coming at twenty to his father's house, which was a very
sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste and pure as he was, simply
withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable, but without
the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation. His father, who
had once been in a dependent position, and so was sensitive and
ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and sullenness.
<q>He does not say much,</q> he used to say, <q>and thinks the more.</q>
But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and
kissing him terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality,
yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him,
such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one before.
</p>

<p>
Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and
it was so from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household
of his patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he
gained the hearts of all the family, so that they looked on him quite
as their own child. Yet he entered the house at such a tender age
that he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning
affection. So that the gift of making himself loved directly and
unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very nature, so to speak.
It was the same at school, though he seemed to be just one of those
children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and even disliked
by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and rather
solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a
corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was
at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see
at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the
contrary he was bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show
off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never
afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that he was
not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was
bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would happen
that an hour after the offense he would address the offender or
answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
though nothing had happened between them. And it was not that
he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront,
but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this completely
conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic
which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the
top want to mock at him, not from malice but because it amused
them. This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity.
He could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations
about women. There are <q>certain</q> words and conversations unhappily
impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure in mind and
heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among themselves,
and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which even
soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much
that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite
young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no
moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is
the appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as
something refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing
that Alyosha Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked
of <q>that,</q> they used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands
away, and shout nastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped
to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of
abuse, enduring their insults in silence. But at last they left him
alone and gave up taunting him with being a <q>regular girl,</q> and
what's more they looked upon it with compassion as a weakness.
He was always one of the best in the class but was never first.
</p>

<p>
At the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more
years to complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable
widow went almost immediately after his death for a long visit to
Italy with her whole family, which consisted only of women and
girls. Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of
Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had never seen before. On what
terms he lived with them he did not know himself. It was very
characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at whose expense
he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to his
elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two
years in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and
had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense
<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>
of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha's character
must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance
with him any one would have perceived that Alyosha
was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious enthusiast,
who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune,
would not hesitate to give it away for the asking, either for
good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he seemed
scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a literal
sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked for,
he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment,
or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
</p>

<p>
In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi√ºsov, a man very sensitive
on the score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following
judgment, after getting to know Alyosha:
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might
leave alone without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of
a million inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not
die of cold and hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once;
and if he were not, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would
cost him no effort or humiliation. And to shelter him would be no
burden, but, on the contrary, would probably be looked on as a
pleasure.</q>
</p>

<p>
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before
the end of the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he
was going to see his father about a plan which had occurred to him.
They were sorry and unwilling to let him go. The journey was
not an expensive one, and the ladies would not let him pawn his
watch, a parting present from his benefactor's family. They provided
him liberally with money and even fitted him out with new
clothes and linen. But he returned half the money they gave him,
saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival in the town
he made no answer to his father's first inquiry why he had come
before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually
thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his
mother's tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that
was the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the
whole reason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not
understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
soul, and drawn him irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable
path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him where his second
wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave since he had
thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had entirely
forgotten where she was buried.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not
been living in our town. Three or four years after his wife's death
he had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa,
where he spent several years. He made the acquaintance at first,
in his own words, <q>of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,</q>
and ended by being received by <q>Jews high and low alike.</q> It may
be presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for
making and hoarding money. He finally returned to our town only
three years before Alyosha's arrival. His former acquaintances
found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means an
old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with
more effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity
for making buffoons of others. His depravity with women was
not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting. In a short
time he opened a great number of new taverns in the district. It
was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not
much less. Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were
soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good security. Of late,
too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more
uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing
and go on with another, as though he were letting himself go altogether.
He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had
not been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged
considerably too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like
a tutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.
Alyosha's arrival seemed to affect even his moral side, as though
something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had
long been dead in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know,</q> he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, <q>that
you are like her, <q>the crazy woman</q></q>&mdash;that was what he used to call
his dead wife, Alyosha's mother. Grigory it was who pointed out
the <q>crazy woman's</q> grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town
cemetery and showed him in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone,
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
cheap but decently kept, on which were inscribed the name and
age of the deceased and the date of her death, and below a four-lined
verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class
tombs. To Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be
Grigory's doing. He had put it up on the poor <q>crazy woman's</q>
grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had
often pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the
grave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion
at the sight of his mother's grave. He only listened to Grigory's
minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood
with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word. It was
perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this little
episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch&mdash;and
a very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our
monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for
the second, Alyosha's mother, the <q>crazy woman,</q> but for the
first, Adela√Øda Ivanovna, who used to thrash him. In the evening
of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha.
He himself was far from being religious; he had probably never
put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses
of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance
at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably
to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his
little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude
of deep wrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam's apple hung
below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a
peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious
mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little stumps of
black decayed teeth. He slobbered every time he began to speak.
He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face, though, I believe,
he was well satisfied with it. He used particularly to point to
his nose, which was not very large, but very delicate and conspicuously
aquiline. <q>A regular Roman nose,</q> he used to say, <q>with my
goiter I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman patrician of
the decadent period.</q> He seemed proud of it.
</p>

<p>
Not long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly announced
that he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
were willing to receive him as a novice. He explained that this was
his strong desire, and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his
father. The old man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living
in the monastery hermitage, had made a special impression upon
his <q>gentle boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the most honest monk among them, of course,</q> he observed,
after listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming
scarcely surprised at his request. <q>H'm!... So that's where you
want to be, my gentle boy?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken
grin, which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy
slyness. <q>H'm!... I had a presentiment that you would end in
something like this. Would you believe it? You were making
straight for it. Well, to be sure you have your own two thousand.
That's a dowry for you. And I'll never desert you, my angel. And
I'll pay what's wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of
course, if they don't ask, why should we worry them? What do you
say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week.
H'm!... Do you know that near one monastery there's a place
outside the town where every baby knows there are none but <q>the
monks' wives</q> living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe.
I have been there myself. You know, it's interesting in its own
way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it's awfully Russian.
There are no French women there. Of course they could get them
fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it
they'll come along. Well, there's nothing of that sort here, no
<q>monks' wives,</q> and two hundred monks. They're honest. They
keep the fasts. I admit it.... H'm.... So you want to be a
monk? And do you know I'm sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would
you believe it, I've really grown fond of you? Well, it's a good
opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much
here. I've always been thinking who would pray for me, and
whether there's any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I'm
awfully stupid about that. You wouldn't believe it. Awfully.
You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep
thinking&mdash;from time to time, of course, not all the while. It's
impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell
with their hooks when I die. Then I wonder&mdash;hooks? Where would
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do they forge
them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in
the monastery probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance.
Now I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling.
It makes it more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is.
And, after all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't?
But, do you know, there's a damnable question involved in it? If
there's no ceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks
it all breaks down, which is unlikely again, for then there would be
none to drag me down to hell, and if they don't drag me down what
justice is there in the world? <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Il faudrait les
inventer</foreign>, those hooks,
on purpose for me alone, for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a
blackguard I am.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But there are no hooks there,</q> said Alyosha, looking gently and
seriously at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That's
how a Frenchman described hell: <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>J'ai bu l'ombre d'un
cocher qui avec l'ombre d'une brosse frottait l'ombre d'une carrosse.</foreign></q> How do
you know there are no hooks, darling? When you've lived with
the monks you'll sing a different tune. But go and get at the truth
there, and then come and tell me. Anyway it's easier going to the
other world if one knows what there is there. Besides, it will be
more seemly for you with the monks than here with me, with a
drunken old man and young harlots ... though you're like an
angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch
you there. That's why I let you go, because I hope for that.
You've got all your wits about you. You will burn and you will
burn out; you will be healed and come back again. And I will wait
for you. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who has
not condemned me. My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can't help
feeling it.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was
wicked and sentimental.

<head>Chapter V. Elders</head>

<p>
Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a
sickly, ecstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive
dreamer. On the contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well-grown,
red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health. He
was very handsome, too, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a
dark brown, with a regular, rather long, oval-shaped face, and wide-set
dark gray, shining eyes; he was very thoughtful, and apparently
very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red cheeks are not incompatible
with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy that Alyosha
was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the monastery
he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are never
a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose
realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will
always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and
if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would
rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he
admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by
him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the
miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound
by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle
Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did
see he said, <q>My Lord and my God!</q> Was it the miracle forced
him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because he
desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart
even when he said, <q>I do not believe till I see.</q>
</p>

<p>
I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had
not finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies
is true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
I'll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon
this path only because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination
and presented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for
his soul from darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some
extent a youth of our last epoch&mdash;that is, honest in nature, desiring
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
the truth, seeking for it and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at
once with all the strength of his soul, seeking for immediate action,
and ready to sacrifice everything, life itself, for it. Though these
young men unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is,
in many cases, the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for
instance, five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious
study, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth
and the cause they have set before them as their goal&mdash;such a sacrifice
is utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path
Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he
chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he
reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and
immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: <q>I want
to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.</q> In the
same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist,
he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism
is not merely the labor question, it is before all things the atheistic
question, the question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the
question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount
to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth. Alyosha would
have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before. It
is written: <q>Give all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me, if
thou wouldst be perfect.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha said to himself: <q>I can't give two roubles instead of
<q>all,</q> and only go to mass instead of <q>following Him.</q></q> Perhaps his
memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his
mother may have taken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight
and the holy image to which his poor <q>crazy</q> mother had held him
up still acted upon his imagination. Brooding on these things he may
have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice
all or only <q>two roubles,</q> and in the monastery he met this elder.
I must digress to explain what an <q>elder</q> is in Russian monasteries,
and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do so. I will
try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a few words.
Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of <q>elders</q> is
of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries,
though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos, it has
existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook
Russia&mdash;the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations
with the East after the destruction of Constantinople&mdash;this institution
fell into oblivion. It was revived among us towards the end
of last century by one of the great <q>ascetics,</q> as they called him,
Pa√Øssy Velitchkovsky, and his disciples. But to this day it exists in
few monasteries only, and has sometimes been almost persecuted as
an innovation in Russia. It flourished especially in the celebrated
Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was introduced into
our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three such
elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying
of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The
question for our monastery was an important one, for it had not
been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they had
neither relics of saints, nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious
traditions, nor historical exploits. It had flourished and been glorious
all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had
flocked for thousands of miles from all parts.
</p>

<p>
What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul,
your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder,
you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission,
complete self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible
school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest,
of self-mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to
attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those
who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves
in themselves. This institution of elders is not founded on theory,
but was established in the East from the practice of a thousand
years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary <q>obedience</q>
which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The
obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted
themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him
and them.
</p>

<p>
The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity
one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon
him by his elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt.
There, after great exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer
torture and a martyr's death for the faith. When the Church, regarding
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
him as a saint, was burying him, suddenly, at the deacon's
exhortation, <q>Depart all ye unbaptized,</q> the coffin containing the
martyr's body left its place and was cast forth from the church,
and this took place three times. And only at last they learnt that
this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and left his elder,
and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder's absolution
in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral take
place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent
instance.
</p>

<p>
A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos,
which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go
first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go
to the north to Siberia: <q>There is the place for thee and not here.</q>
The monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to the ≈ícumenical
Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him to release him from
his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not only was he unable
to release him, but there was not and could not be on earth a power
which could release him except the elder who had himself laid that
duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases
with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many
of our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to
persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly
esteemed among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well
as men of distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our
monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings,
and ask for counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of
the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being
arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the continual opening
of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing
of the character of the sacrament. In the end, however, the institution
of elders has been retained and is becoming established in
Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this instrument which
had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration
of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may
be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and
complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to
bondage and not to freedom.
</p>

<p>
The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners,
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
had been in the army in early youth, and served in the
Caucasus as an officer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by
some peculiar quality of his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the
elder, who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him. It
must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could
go where he pleased and be absent for whole days. Though he wore
the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others.
No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination was
deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that
so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to
Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing,
that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an
unknown face what a new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering
on his conscience. He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed
his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken
a word.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for
the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with
bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the
fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he
was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more
drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner
the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of
his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they
were few in number and they were silent, though among them were
some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the
older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows
of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima's side and very
many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.
Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though
not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt
of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and
great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics.
Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the
elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin
that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick
children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
and to pray over them, return shortly after&mdash;some the next day&mdash;and,
falling in tears at the elder's feet, thank him for healing their
sick.
</p>

<p>
Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the
natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for
Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher
and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own
triumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over
when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting
crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from
all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing.
They fell down before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed the earth
on which he stood, and wailed, while the women held up their children
to him and brought him the sick <q>possessed with devils.</q>
The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed them,
and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks
of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and
the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha
did not wonder why they loved him so, why they fell down before
him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face. Oh! he
understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant, worn
out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting injustice and
everlasting sin, his own and the world's, it was the greatest need
and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before
and worship.
</p>

<p>
<q>Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere
on earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the
truth; he knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it
will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according to
the promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even
reasoned. He understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this
saint and custodian of God's truth&mdash;of that he had no more doubt
than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their
children to the elder. The conviction that after his death the elder
would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger
in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind of deep flame
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart. He
was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a solitary example
before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of
renewal for all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on
the earth, and all men will be holy and love one another, and there
will be no more rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will
be as the children of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will
come.</q> That was the dream in Alyosha's heart.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till
then, seemed to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more
quickly made friends with his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived
later) than with his own brother Ivan. He was extremely
interested in his brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two
months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were
still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed to be
expecting something, ashamed about something, while his brother
Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and
curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him.
Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his
brother's indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education.
But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and
sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown
to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something&mdash;something
inward and important&mdash;that he was striving
towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was
why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether
there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for
him&mdash;a foolish novice. He knew for certain that his brother was
an atheist. He could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed;
yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand,
he waited for his brother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used
to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar
earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of the important
affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable
bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri's enthusiastic references
to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri
was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be
difficult to find two men more unlike.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the
members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the
elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The
pretext for this gathering was a false one. It was at this time that
the discord between Dmitri and his father seemed at its acutest
stage and their relations had become insufferably strained. Fyodor
Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest, apparently in
joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima's cell, and that,
without appealing to his direct intervention, they might more
decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence
of the elder's presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder,
naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but,
as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his
father on several recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It
must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying with his father,
but living apart at the other end of the town. It happened that
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi√ºsov, who was staying in the district at
the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the forties and fifties,
a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom
or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the
desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with
the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing
the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor
coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more
attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity.
Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the
elder, who of late had scarcely left his cell, and had been forced
by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors. In the end he consented
to see them, and the day was fixed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who has made me a judge over them?</q> was all he said, smilingly,
to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit.
Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one
who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would
come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder.
Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and Mi√ºsov would come from
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be
contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing,
Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was
far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the
day with a heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his
mind how the family discord could be ended. But his chief anxiety
concerned the elder. He trembled for him, for his glory, and
dreaded any affront to him, especially the refined, courteous irony of
Mi√ºsov and the supercilious half-utterances of the highly educated
Ivan. He even wanted to venture on warning the elder, telling him
something about them, but, on second thoughts, said nothing. He
only sent word the day before, through a friend, to his brother
Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep his promise.
Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had promised,
but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let
himself be provoked <q>by vileness,</q> but that, although he had a deep
respect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that
the meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking
in respect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,</q> he
wrote in conclusion. Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.

<head>Chapter I. They Arrive At The Monastery</head>

<p>
It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview
with the elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately
after late mass. Our visitors did not take part in the service, but
arrived just as it was over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn
by two valuable horses, drove up with Mi√ºsov and a distant relative
of his, a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov.
This young man was preparing to enter the university. Mi√ºsov,
with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to persuade him
to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young man
was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He
was nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange
fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he
would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was
silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with
any one, he became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything
or nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared.
He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had
already some independent fortune and expectations of much more.
He was a friend of Alyosha's.
</p>

<p>
In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of
old pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Mi√ºsov's carriage, came
Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though
he had been informed of the time the evening before. The visitors
left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to
the gates of the monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch,
none of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Mi√ºsov had
probably not even been to church for thirty years. He looked
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
about him with curiosity, together with assumed ease. But, except
the church and the domestic buildings, though these too were ordinary
enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the
monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the
church, bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler
people were a few of higher rank&mdash;two or three ladies and a very
old general. They were all staying at the hotel. Our visitors were
at once surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything,
except young Kalganov, who took a ten-copeck piece out of
his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed&mdash;God knows why!&mdash;hurriedly
gave it to an old woman, saying: <q>Divide it equally.</q> None
of his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no
reason to be embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more
overcome.
</p>

<p>
It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that
they were not received with special honor, though one of them had
recently made a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was
a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in
the monastery were in a sense dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit
might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands.
Yet no official personage met them.
</p>

<p>
Mi√ºsov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the
church, and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here
must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this <q>holy
place,</q> but refrained. His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost
into anger.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must
find out, for time is passing,</q> he observed suddenly, as though
speaking to himself.
</p>

<p>
All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating
little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting
his hat, he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a
landowner of Tula. He at once entered into our visitors' difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces
from the monastery, the other side of the copse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it's the other side of the copse,</q> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,
<q>but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since
we've been here.</q>
</p>

<pb n='033'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>

<p>
<q>This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the
copse. Come with me, won't you? I'll show you. I have to go....
I am going myself. This way, this way.</q>
</p>

<p>
They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov,
a man of sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to
stare at them all, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity.
His eyes looked starting out of his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,</q>
observed Mi√ºsov severely. <q>That personage has granted us an audience,
so to speak, and so, though we thank you for showing us the
way, we cannot ask you to accompany us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been there. I've been already; <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>un
chevalier parfait</foreign>,</q> and
Maximov snapped his fingers in the air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chevalier</foreign>?</q> asked Mi√ºsov.
</p>

<p>
<q>The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory
of the monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!</q>
</p>

<p>
But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking
monk of medium height, wearing a monk's cap, who overtook them.
Fyodor Pavlovitch and Mi√ºsov stopped.
</p>

<p>
The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:
</p>

<p>
<q>The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with
him after your visit to the hermitage. At one o'clock, not later.
And you also,</q> he added, addressing Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I certainly will, without fail,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
hugely delighted at the invitation. <q>And, believe me, we've all
given our word to behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the
customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you suppose
I like all this business, and in your company, too? So we will
come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior,</q> he said to the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,</q> answered
the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior&mdash;to the Father
Superior,</q> babbled Maximov.
</p>

<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>

<p>
<q>The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please&mdash;</q>
the monk hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Impertinent old man!</q> Mi√ºsov observed aloud, while Maximov
ran back to the monastery.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's like von Sohn,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von
Sohn? Have you ever seen von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something indefinable.
He's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the
physiognomy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word
to behave properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself.
But, if you begin to play the fool I don't intend to be associated with
you here.... You see what a man he is</q>&mdash;he turned to the monk&mdash;<q>I'm
afraid to go among decent people with him.</q> A fine smile,
not without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of
the monk, but he made no reply, and was evidently silent from a
sense of his own dignity. Mi√ºsov frowned more than ever.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through
centuries, and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,</q>
flashed through Mi√ºsov's mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here's the hermitage. We've arrived,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<q>The gates are shut.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted
above and on the sides of the gates.
</p>

<p>
<q>When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here
in this hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved. They
look at one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in
at this gate. That's what is remarkable. And that really is so. But
I did hear that the elder receives ladies,</q> he remarked suddenly to
the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there
waiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built
adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts&mdash;you can see the
windows&mdash;and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when
he is well enough. They are always outside the precincts. There is
a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her sick
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
daughter. Probably he has promised to come out to her, though
of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even
to the people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage
to the ladies. Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean any
harm. But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of
women are not allowed, but no creature of the female sex&mdash;no hens,
nor turkey-hens, nor cows.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you
here. They'll turn you out when I'm gone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,</q>
he cried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, <q>what a vale of
roses they live in!</q>
</p>

<p>
Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and
beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for
them, and evidently tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds
round the church, and between the tombs; and the one-storied
wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.
</p>

<p>
<q>And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy?
He didn't care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and
thrash even ladies with a stick,</q> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he
went up the steps.
</p>

<p>
<q>The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a
great deal that's told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,</q>
answered the monk. <q>Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute
I will announce you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you
hear? Behave properly or I will pay you out!</q> Mi√ºsov had time to
mutter again.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't think why you are so agitated,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch observed
sarcastically. <q>Are you uneasy about your sins? They say
he can tell by one's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot
you think of their opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm
surprised at you.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Mi√ºsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were
asked to come in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and
begin to quarrel&mdash;and lower myself and my ideas,</q> he reflected.

<head>Chapter II. The Old Buffoon</head>

<p>
They entered the room almost at the same moment that the
elder came in from his bedroom. There were already in the
cell, awaiting the elder, two monks of the hermitage, one the
Father Librarian, and the other Father Pa√Øssy, a very learned man, so
they said, in delicate health, though not old. There was also a tall
young man, who looked about two and twenty, standing in the
corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh face, and
clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary
dress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of
the monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,
reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position,
and so not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet
them with a bow.
</p>

<p>
Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha.
The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching
the ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing
them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked
their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously
and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But
Mi√ºsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness.
He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought&mdash;he had reflected
upon it the evening before&mdash;from simple politeness, since it was
the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing,
even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing
and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind.
With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and
moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking
Mi√ºsov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy,
but he too kept his hands at his sides, while Kalganov was so confused
that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall the hand raised
to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down.
The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He was ashamed. His forebodings
were coming true.
</p>

<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>

<p>
Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa,
covered with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along
the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby
black leather. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the
window. The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained
standing. The cell was not very large and had a faded look. It contained
nothing but the most necessary furniture, of coarse and poor
quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window, and a number
of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon of
the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures
in shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china
eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it,
and several foreign engravings from the great Italian artists of past
centuries. Next to these costly and artistic engravings were several
of the roughest Russian prints of saints and martyrs, such as are
sold for a few farthings at all the fairs. On the other walls were
portraits of Russian bishops, past and present.
</p>

<p>
Mi√ºsov took a cursory glance at all these <q>conventional</q> surroundings
and bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high
opinion of his own insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was
fifty, an age at which a clever man of the world of established
position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously. At the first
moment he did not like Zossima. There was, indeed, something in
the elder's face which many people besides Mi√ºsov might not have
liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very weak legs, and
though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years older.
His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,
particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,
quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling
of gray hair about his temples. His pointed beard was small
and scanty, and his lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as
two threads. His nose was not long, but sharp, like a bird's beak.
</p>

<p>
<q>To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,</q> thought
Mi√ºsov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.
</p>

<p>
A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and
served to begin the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely to our time,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>but no sign
of my son, Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!</q> (Alyosha
<pb n='038'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>
shuddered all over at <q>sacred elder.</q>) <q>I am always punctual myself,
minute for minute, remembering that punctuality is the courtesy
of kings....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are not a king, anyway,</q> Mi√ºsov muttered, losing his
self-restraint at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I
always say the wrong thing. Your reverence,</q> he cried, with sudden
pathos, <q>you behold before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce
myself as such. It's an old habit, alas! And if I sometimes
talk nonsense out of place it's with an object, with the object of
amusing people and making myself agreeable. One must be agreeable,
mustn't one? I was seven years ago in a little town where I
had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We
went to the captain of police because we had to see him about
something, and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair,
sulky man, the most dangerous type in such cases. It's their liver.
I went straight up to him, and with the ease of a man of the world,
you know, <q>Mr. Ispravnik,</q> said I, <q>be our Napravnik.</q> <q>What do
you mean by Napravnik?</q> said he. I saw, at the first half-second,
that it had missed fire. He stood there so glum. <q>I wanted to make
a joke,</q> said I, <q>for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our
well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the
harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.</q> And I
explained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? <q>Excuse me,</q>
said he, <q>I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on
my calling.</q> He turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting,
<q>Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.</q> <q>No,</q> he
said, <q>since you called me a Napravnik I am one.</q> And would you
believe it, it ruined our business! And I'm always like that, always
like that. Always injuring myself with my politeness. Once, many
years ago, I said to an influential person: <q>Your wife is a ticklish
lady,</q> in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities, so to speak. But
he asked me, <q>Why, have you tickled her?</q> I thought I'd be polite,
so I couldn't help saying, <q>Yes,</q> and he gave me a fine tickling on
the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I'm not ashamed to tell
the story. I'm always injuring myself like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're doing it now,</q> muttered Mi√ºsov, with disgust.
</p>

<pb n='039'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>

<p>
Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as
soon as I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that
you'd be the first to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn't
coming off, your reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they
were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in
them. That's been so since I was young, when I had to make jokes
for my living in noblemen's families. I am an inveterate buffoon,
and have been from birth up, your reverence, it's as though it were
a craze in me. I dare say it's a devil within me. But only a little
one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But
not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth
having either. But I do believe&mdash;I believe in God, though I have
had doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom.
I'm like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever
hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan
Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine? He went in and
said straight out, <q>There is no God.</q> To which the great bishop
lifted up his finger and answered, <q>The fool hath said in his heart
there is no God.</q> And he fell down at his feet on the spot. <q>I
believe,</q> he cried, <q>and will be christened.</q> And so he was. Princess
Dashkov was his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling
lies and that that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing
the fool?</q> cried Mi√ºsov in a shaking voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I suspected all my life that it wasn't true,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cried with conviction. <q>But I'll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen.
Great elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's
christening I made up just now. I never thought of it before. I
made it up to add piquancy. I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
to make myself agreeable. Though I really don't know myself,
sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot, I heard as far as
<q>the fool hath said in his heart</q> twenty times from the gentry about
here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
tell the story. They all believe to this day that the infidel Diderot
came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan Platon....</q>
</p>

<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>

<p>
Mi√ºsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was
furious, and conscious of being ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty
or fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had
entered that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration.
Almost every one admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was
being shown him. Many remained kneeling during the whole visit.
Of those visitors, many had been men of high rank and learning,
some even freethinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all without exception
had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy, for here
there was no question of money, but only, on the one side love and
kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some
spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered
the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with
unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear
what the elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up,
like Mi√ºsov. Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of
tears. What seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother
Ivan, on whom alone he had rested his hopes, and who alone had such
influence on his father that he could have stopped him, sat now quite
unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to
see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do with it.
Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity student, whom
he knew almost intimately. He alone in the monastery knew Rakitin's
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me,</q> began Mi√ºsov, addressing Father Zossima, <q>for
perhaps I seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made
a mistake in believing that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would
understand what was due on a visit to so honored a personage. I
did not suppose I should have to apologize simply for having come
with him....</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave
the room, overwhelmed with confusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't distress yourself, I beg.</q> The elder got on to his feeble
legs, and taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit
down again. <q>I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg
you to be my guest.</q> And with a bow he went back and sat down
again on his little sofa.
</p>

<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>

<p>
<q>Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?</q> Fyodor
Pavlovitch cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both
hands, as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.
</p>

<p>
<q>I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be
uneasy,</q> the elder said impressively. <q>Do not trouble. Make yourself
quite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself,
for that is at the root of it all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too
much, but I accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed
Father, you'd better not invite me to be my natural self. Don't
risk it.... I will not go so far as that myself. I warn you for
your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged in the mists of uncertainty,
though there are people who'd be pleased to describe me for
you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for you,
holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.</q>
</p>

<p>
He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, <q>Blessed be
the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck&mdash;the
paps especially. When you said just now, <q>Don't be so ashamed of
yourself, for that is at the root of it all,</q> you pierced right through
me by that remark, and read me to the core. Indeed, I always feel
when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take
me for a buffoon. So I say, <q>Let me really play the buffoon. I am
not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one of you worse than
I am.</q> That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame, great elder,
from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes me rowdy.
If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the kindest
and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have
been then! Teacher!</q> he fell suddenly on his knees, <q>what must I
do to gain eternal life?</q>
</p>

<p>
It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really
moved.
</p>

<p>
Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a
smile:
</p>

<p>
<q>You have known for a long time what you must do. You
have sense enough: don't give way to drunkenness and incontinence
of speech; don't give way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the
<pb n='042'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>
love of money. And close your taverns. If you can't close all,
at least two or three. And, above all&mdash;don't lie.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean about Diderot?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The
man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a
pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around
him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having
no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract
himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures,
and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other
men and to himself. The man who lies to himself can be more easily
offended than any one. You know it is sometimes very pleasant
to take offense, isn't it? A man may know that nobody has insulted
him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and
exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made
a mountain out of a molehill&mdash;he knows that himself, yet he will
be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he
feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But
get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the
elder's thin hand. <q>It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said
that so well, as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life
taking offense, to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds,
for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted&mdash;that
you had forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I
shall make a note of that. But I have been lying, lying positively
my whole life long, every day and hour of it. Of a truth, I am a
lie, and the father of lies. Though I believe I am not the father of
lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that
will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk
about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word
will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I
had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose
to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch
not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it true, great
Father, that the story is told somewhere in the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head was cut
off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, <q>courteously kissing
it,</q> walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true or not,
honored Father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it is untrue,</q> said the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What
saint do you say the story is told of?</q> asked the Father Librarian.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I
was deceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you
know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi√ºsov here, who was
so angry just now about Diderot. He it was who told the story.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present.
It was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous
story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew
nothing of it, but I went home with my faith shaken, and I have
been getting more and more shaken ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
you were the cause of a great fall. That was not a
Diderot!</q>
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly
clear to every one by now that he was playing a part again.
Yet Mi√ºsov was stung by his words.
</p>

<p>
<q>What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,</q> he muttered. <q>I may
really have told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was
told it myself. I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me
it was read at our mass from the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi> ... he was
a very learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics
and had lived a long time in Russia.... I have not read
the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi> myself, and I am not going to read them ...
all sorts of things are said at dinner&mdash;we were dining then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!</q> said Fyodor
Pavlovitch, mimicking him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do I care for your faith?</q> Mi√ºsov was on the point of
shouting, but he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt,
<q>You defile everything you touch.</q>
</p>

<p>
The elder suddenly rose from his seat. <q>Excuse me, gentlemen,
for leaving you a few minutes,</q> he said, addressing all his guests.
<q>I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you. But don't
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
you tell lies all the same,</q> he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch
with a good-humored face. He went out of the cell. Alyosha and
the novice flew to escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless:
he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too, that the elder
was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going
towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But
Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed man!</q> he cried, with feeling. <q>Allow me to kiss your
hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get
on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe
me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you.
I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on
with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am
ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you! But
now, I'll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I'll sit in a chair
and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
You are the principal person left now&mdash;for ten minutes.</q>

<head>Chapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith</head>

<p>
Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of
the precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant
women. They had been told that the elder was at last coming out,
and they had gathered together in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame
Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come out into the portico to
wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women
of rank.
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive,
and always dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had
lively black eyes. She was not more than thirty-three, and had
been five years a widow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially
paralyzed. The poor child had not been able to walk for the
last six months, and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair.
She had a charming little face, rather thin from illness, but full of
gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with
<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>
their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her
abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the
summer by business connected with their estate. They had been staying
a week in our town, where they had come more for purposes of
business than devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once already,
three days before. Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw
any one, they had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently entreated
<q>the happiness of looking once again on the great healer.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter's
invalid carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one
of our monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the
far north. He too sought the elder's blessing.
</p>

<p>
But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight
to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that
led up into the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put
on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him.
One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight
of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains
of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a short
prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted.
</p>

<p>
I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often
happened to see and hear these <q>possessed</q> women in the villages
and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would
squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the
church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led
up to it, at once the <q>possession</q> ceased, and the sick women were
always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at
this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from
my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid
work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various
anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with
astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about
it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially
prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of
the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting
toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth,
and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which
some women were not able to endure like others. The strange and
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she
was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been explained to me
as due to malingering and the trickery of the <q>clericals,</q> arose
probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported
her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond
question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out
if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow
down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged
woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took
place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down
to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing
and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did
come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same
now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.
</p>

<p>
Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy
by the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment,
others cried out in sing-song voices.
</p>

<p>
He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The <q>possessed</q>
woman he knew already. She came from a village only six
versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him before.
</p>

<p>
<q>But here is one from afar.</q> He pointed to a woman by no
means old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt
but almost blackened by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing
with a fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied
in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles
from here. From afar off, Father, from afar off!</q> the woman
began in a sing-song voice as though she were chanting a dirge,
swaying her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her
hand.
</p>

<p>
There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among
the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a
grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and
finds vent in wailing. This is particularly common with women.
But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort
only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire
consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations
spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound.
</p>

<pb n='047'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>

<p>
<q>You are of the tradesman class?</q> said Father Zossima, looking
curiously at her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though
we live in the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard
of you, Father, we heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I
have come on a pilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but
they told me, <q>Go, Nastasya, go to them</q>&mdash;that is to you. I have
come; I was yesterday at the service, and to-day I have come to
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you weeping for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. He was three years
old&mdash;three years all but three months. For my little boy, Father,
I'm in anguish, for my little boy. He was the last one left. We
had four, my Nikita and I, and now we've no children, our dear ones
have all gone. I buried the first three without grieving overmuch,
and now I have buried the last I can't forget him. He seems always
standing before me. He never leaves me. He has withered my
heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and
I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his little things. I look
at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, <q>Let me go on a
pilgrimage, master.</q> He is a driver. We're not poor people,
Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the
horse and the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My
Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He's sure to. It used
to be so before. As soon as I turn my back he gives way to it. But
now I don't think about him. It's three months since I left home.
I've forgotten him. I've forgotten everything. I don't want to
remember. And what would our life be now together? I've done
with him, I've done. I've done with them all. I don't care to look
upon my house and my goods. I don't care to see anything at all!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, mother,</q> said the elder. <q>Once in olden times a holy
saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one,
her only one, whom God had taken. <q>Knowest thou not,</q> said the
saint to her, <q>how bold these little ones are before the throne of
God? Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of
Heaven. <q>Thou didst give us life, O Lord,</q> they say, <q>and scarcely
had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again.</q> And
so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
rank of angels. Therefore,</q> said the saint, <q>thou, too, O mother, rejoice
and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the fellowship
of the angels.</q> That's what the saint said to the weeping
mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken
falsely. Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is
surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying
to God for you, and therefore weep not, but rejoice.</q>
</p>

<p>
The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her
hand. She sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
<q>My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you.
<q>Foolish one,</q> he said, <q>why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with
the angels before God.</q> He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I
see that he cries like me. <q>I know, Nikita,</q> said I. <q>Where could
he be if not with the Lord God? Only, here with us now he is not
as he used to sit beside us before.</q> And if only I could look upon
him one little time, if only I could peep at him one little time, without
going up to him, without speaking, if I could be hidden in a
corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him playing
in the yard, calling in his little voice, <q>Mammy, where are you?</q>
If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room
just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used
to run to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet
I should know him! But he's gone, Father, he's gone, and I shall
never hear him again. Here's his little sash, but him I shall never
see or hear now.</q>
</p>

<p>
She drew out of her bosom her boy's little embroidered sash, and
as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her
eyes with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden
stream.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is Rachel of old,</q> said the elder, <q>weeping for her children,
and will not be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set
on earth for you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not
what you need. Weep and be not consoled, but weep. Only every
time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of
the angels of God, that he looks down from there at you and sees
you, and rejoices at your tears, and points at them to the Lord God;
and a long while yet will you keep that great mother's grief. But
it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be
<pb n='049'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>
only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it
from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your child's soul.
What was his name?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey, Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your
grief in my prayers, and I will pray for your husband's health. It is
a sin for you to leave him. Your little one will see from heaven
that you have forsaken his father, and will weep over you. Why
do you trouble his happiness? He is living, for the soul lives for
ever, and though he is not in the house he is near you, unseen. How
can he go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to
you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together, his father
and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But
then he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother;
go this very day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You've gone
straight to my heart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for
me,</q> the woman began in a sing-song voice; but the elder had
already turned away to a very old woman, dressed like a dweller in
the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes showed that she had come
with an object, and in order to say something. She said she was
the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close by in the
town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had
gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but
now a year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about
him, but she did not know the proper place to inquire.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna&mdash;she's a rich merchant's
wife&mdash;said to me, <q>You go, Prohorovna, and put your son's
name down for prayer in the church, and pray for the peace of his
soul as though he were dead. His soul will be troubled,</q> she said,
<q>and he will write you a letter.</q> And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me
it was a certain thing which had been many times tried. Only I am
in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or false, and would
it be right?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't think of it. It's shameful to ask the question. How
is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own
<pb n='050'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>
mother too! It's a great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance
it is forgiven you. Better pray to the Queen of Heaven,
our swift defense and help, for his good health, and that she may
forgive you for your error. And another thing I will tell you,
Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you, your son, or
he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in peace.
Your son is alive, I tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for
all of us and for our sins!</q>
</p>

<p>
But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes
fixed upon him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young
peasant woman was gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought
him, but she seemed afraid to approach.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, my child?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Absolve my soul, Father,</q> she articulated softly, and slowly
sank on her knees and bowed down at his feet. <q>I have sinned,
Father. I am afraid of my sin.</q>
</p>

<p>
The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer
to him, still on her knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a widow these three years,</q> she began in a half-whisper,
with a sort of shudder. <q>I had a hard life with my husband. He
was an old man. He used to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought
looking at him, if he were to get well, if he were to get up again,
what then? And then the thought came to me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay!</q> said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.
</p>

<p>
The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible
to catch anything. She had soon done.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three years ago?</q> asked the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three years. At first I didn't think about it, but now I've
begun to be ill, and the thought never leaves me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you come from far?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Over three hundred miles away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you told it in confession?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you been admitted to Communion?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your
penitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
can be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to
the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust
the infinite love of God. Can there be a sin which could
exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual repentance,
but dismiss fear altogether. Believe that God loves you
as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your sin, in your sin.
It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more
joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not. Be
not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive
the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled
with him in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love
you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by
love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have
pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a priceless
treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not
only your own sins but the sins of others.</q>
</p>

<p>
He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck
a little ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth
without speaking.
</p>

<p>
He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with
a tiny baby in her arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>From Vyshegorye, dear Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do
you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've come to look at you. I have been to you before&mdash;or have
you forgotten? You've no great memory if you've forgotten me.
They told us you were ill. Thinks I, I'll go and see him for myself.
Now I see you, and you're not ill! You'll live another twenty
years. God bless you! There are plenty to pray for you; how
should you be ill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you for all, daughter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are
sixty copecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me.
I thought as I came along, better give through him. He'll know
whom to give to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you.
I will do so certainly. Is that your little girl?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.</q>
</p>

<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>

<p>
<q>May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta!
You have gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children,
farewell, dear ones.</q>
</p>

<p>
He blessed them all and bowed low to them.

<head>Chapter IV. A Lady Of Little Faith</head>

<p>
A visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the
peasants and his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped
them away with her handkerchief. She was a sentimental society
lady of genuinely good disposition in many respects. When the
elder went up to her at last she met him enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...</q>
She could not go on for emotion. <q>Oh, I understand the
people's love for you. I love the people myself. I want to love
them. And who could help loving them, our splendid Russian
people, so simple in their greatness!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How is your daughter's health? You wanted to talk to me
again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it!
I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your
windows until you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express
our ardent gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her
completely, merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying
your hands upon her. We have hastened here to kiss those hands,
to pour out our feelings and our homage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in
her chair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,</q>
said the lady with nervous haste. <q>And that's not all. Her legs
are stronger. This morning she got up well; she had slept all night.
Look at her rosy cheeks, her bright eyes! She used to be always
crying, but now she laughs and is gay and happy. This morning
she insisted on my letting her stand up, and she stood up for a whole
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
minute without any support. She wagers that in a fortnight she'll
be dancing a quadrille. I've called in Doctor Herzenstube. He
shrugged his shoulders and said, <q>I am amazed; I can make nothing
of it.</q> And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not
fly here to thank you? Lise, thank him&mdash;thank him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise's pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She
rose in her chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder,
clasped her hands before him, but could not restrain herself and
broke into laughter.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's at him,</q> she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation
at herself for not being able to repress her mirth.
</p>

<p>
If any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the
elder, he would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in
an instant. His eyes shone and he looked down.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are
you?</q> the mother went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand
to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at
Alyosha. The latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely
awkward way, held out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important
air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.</q> She handed
him a little note. <q>She particularly begs you to go and see her
as soon as possible; that you will not fail her, but will be sure to
come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?</q> Alyosha
muttered in great astonishment. His face at once looked anxious.
<q>Oh, it's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and&mdash;what has happened
lately,</q> the mother explained hurriedly. <q>Katerina Ivanovna
has made up her mind, but she must see you about it.... Why,
of course, I can't say. But she wants to see you at once. And you
will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have only seen her once,</q> Alyosha protested with the same
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her
suffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is
enduring now! Think what awaits her! It's all terrible, terrible!</q>
</p>

<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>

<p>
<q>Very well, I will come,</q> Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning
the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty
that he would come, without any sort of explanation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!</q> cried Lise
with sudden animation. <q>I told mamma you'd be sure not to go.
I said you were saving your soul. How splendid you are! I've always
thought you were splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise!</q> said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she
had said it.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she said;
<q>you never come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is
never happy except with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again
smiled without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching
him. He had begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before,
had been awaiting his entrance by Lise's chair. He was evidently
a monk of the humblest, that is of the peasant, class, of a
narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in his own way, a stubborn
one. He announced that he had come from the far north, from
Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor monastery,
consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing
and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you presume to do such deeds?</q> the monk asked suddenly,
pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring
to her <q>healing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete
cure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there
has been any healing, it is by no power but God's will. It's all from
God. Visit me, Father,</q> he added to the monk. <q>It's not often I
can see visitors. I am ill, and I know that my days are numbered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a
long, long time yet,</q> cried the lady. <q>And in what way are you ill?
You look so well, so gay and happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it's only
for a moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem
so happy to you, you could never say anything that would please
me so much. For men are made for happiness, and any one who is
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
completely happy has a right to say to himself, <q>I am doing God's
will on earth.</q> All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs
were happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!</q> cried the
lady. <q>You seem to pierce with your words. And yet&mdash;happiness,
happiness&mdash;where is it? Who can say of himself that he is happy?
Oh, since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day,
let me tell you what I could not utter last time, what I dared
not say, all I am suffering and have been for so long! I am suffering!
Forgive me! I am suffering!</q>
</p>

<p>
And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>From what specially?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suffer ... from lack of faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lack of faith in God?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life&mdash;it
is such an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen!
You are a healer, you are deeply versed in the human soul, and of
course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure
you on my word of honor that I am not speaking lightly now. The
thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish, to
terror. And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not dared
to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God!
What will you think of me now?</q>
</p>

<p>
She clasped her hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't distress yourself about my opinion of you,</q> said the elder.
<q>I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and
ask myself if every one has faith, where did it come from? And
then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena
of nature, and that none of it's real. And I say to myself,
<q>What if I've been believing all my life, and when I come to die
there's nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave?</q> as I read
in some author. It's awful! How&mdash;how can I get back my faith?
But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically, without
thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come
now to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this
chance slip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it?
How can I convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares; no one
troubles his head about it, and I'm the only one who can't stand it.
It's deadly&mdash;deadly!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No doubt. But there's no proving it, though you can be convinced
of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor
actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you
will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your
soul. If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your
neighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can
possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In active love? There's another question&mdash;and such a question!
You see, I so love humanity that&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;I often
dream of forsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister
of mercy. I close my eyes and think and dream, and at that
moment I feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles. No
wounds, no festering sores could at that moment frighten me. I
would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would
nurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams
and not others. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in
reality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?</q> the lady went
on fervently, almost frantically. <q>That's the chief question&mdash;that's
my most agonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself,
<q>Would you persevere long on that path? And if the patient whose
wounds you are washing did not meet you with gratitude, but worried
you with his whims, without valuing or remarking your
charitable services, began abusing you and rudely commanding you,
and complaining to the superior authorities of you (which often
happens when people are in great suffering)&mdash;what then? Would
you persevere in your love, or not?</q> And do you know, I came with
horror to the conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love
to humanity, it would be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant,
I expect my payment at once&mdash;that is, praise, and the repayment
of love with love. Otherwise I am incapable of loving any
one.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding,
she looked with defiant resolution at the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's just the same story as a doctor once told me,</q> observed
the elder. <q>He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly
clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest.
<q>I love humanity,</q> he said, <q>but I wonder at myself. The more I love
humanity in general, the less I love man in particular. In my
dreams,</q> he said, <q>I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes
for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have faced
crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary; and yet I am incapable
of living in the same room with any one for two days
together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me,
his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom.
In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one
because he's too long over his dinner; another because he has a cold
and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment
they come close to me. But it has always happened that the
more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love
for humanity.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must
one despair?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you
can, and it will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you
since you can so deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have
been talking to me so sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your
frankness, as you did from me just now, then of course you will not
attain to anything in the achievement of real love; it will all get
no further than dreams, and your whole life will slip away like a
phantom. In that case you will naturally cease to think of the
future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer after a fashion
in the end.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand
that I was really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity
when I told you I could not endure ingratitude. You have revealed
me to myself. You have seen through me and explained me to
myself!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession,
I believe that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
attain happiness, always remember that you are on the right road,
and try not to leave it. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of
falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own
deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid
being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you
bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing
it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence
of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don't be frightened overmuch
even at your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling
to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared
with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate
action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men will even
give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon
over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage.
But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too,
perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you see
with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther
from your goal instead of nearer to it&mdash;at that very moment I predict
that you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power
of the Lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously
guiding you. Forgive me for not being able to stay longer with you.
They are waiting for me. Good-by.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lady was weeping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, Lise! Bless her&mdash;bless her!</q> she cried, starting up suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness
all along,</q> the elder said jestingly. <q>Why have you been laughing
at Alexey?</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time.
She had noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at
her, and she found this extremely amusing. She waited intently to
catch his eye. Alyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was
irresistibly and suddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she
smiled triumphantly in his face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted
and vexed. At last he turned away from her altogether and
hid behind the elder's back. After a few minutes, drawn by the
same irresistible force, he turned again to see whether he was being
looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out of her chair
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look. Catching
his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying, <q>Why
do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed
and her face became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and
nervously in a warm and resentful voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me
about when I was little. We used to play together. He used to
come to teach me to read, do you know. Two years ago, when he
went away, he said that he would never forget me, that we were
friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now he's afraid of me all at
once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesn't he want to come near
me? Why doesn't he talk? Why won't he come and see us? It's not
that you won't let him. We know that he goes everywhere. It's
not good manners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought
of it first, if he hasn't forgotten me. No, now he's saving his soul!
Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs he'll fall.</q>
</p>

<p>
And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into
irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened
to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed
his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be angry with me. I'm silly and good for nothing ...
and perhaps Alyosha's right, quite right, in not wanting to come and
see such a ridiculous girl.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will certainly send him,</q> said the elder.

<p>
The elder's absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-five
minutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on
whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. But
he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the
cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation. Ivan
and the two monks took the leading share in it. Mi√ºsov, too, was
trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the conversation.
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was evidently in the
background, and his remarks were treated with neglect, which increased
his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with
Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan
showed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is
progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores
us,</q> he thought.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be
quiet, had actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his
neighbor Mi√ºsov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying
his discomfiture. He had been waiting for some time to pay off
old scores, and now he could not let the opportunity slip. Bending
over his shoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didn't you go away just now, after the <q>courteously kissing</q>?
Why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company?
It was because you felt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained
to vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence. Now you
won't go till you've displayed your intellect to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You again?... On the contrary, I'm just going.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be the last, the last of all to go!</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered
him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father
Zossima's return.
</p>

<p>
The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating
himself in his former place, looked at them all as though cordially
inviting them to go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his
face, saw that he was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort.
Of late he had been liable to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face
had the pallor that was common before such attacks, and his lips
were white. But he evidently did not want to break up the party.
He seemed to have some special object of his own in keeping them.
What object? Alyosha watched him intently.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,</q> said
Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan.
<q>He brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument
cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an
ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court,
and the scope of its jurisdiction.</q>
</p>

<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry I have not read your article, but I've heard of it,</q>
said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>He takes up a most interesting position,</q> continued the Father
Librarian. <q>As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently
quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's interesting. But in what sense?</q> Father Zossima asked
Ivan.
</p>
