wasn't printed. And do you know, I have felt sore about it to this
day. My best feelings, gratitude, for instance, are literally denied
me simply from my social position.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Philosophical reflections again?</q> Ivan snarled malignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>God preserve me from it, but one can't help complaining sometimes.
I am a slandered man. You upbraid me every moment with
being stupid. One can see you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence
isn't the only thing! I have naturally a kind and merry heart.
<q>I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.</q> You seem to take me for
Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more serious one. Before
time was, by some decree which I could never make out, I was pre-destined
<q>to deny</q> and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not at
all inclined to negation. <q>No, you must go and deny, without denial
there's no criticism and what would a journal be without a column
of criticism?</q> Without criticism it would be nothing but one <q>hosannah.</q>
But nothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah
must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on, in the
same style. But I don't meddle in that, I didn't create it, I am not
answerable for it. Well, they've chosen their scapegoat, they've
made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible.
We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask for
annihilation. No, live, I am told, for there'd be nothing without
you. If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would
happen. There would be no events without you, and there must
be events. So against the grain I serve to produce events and do
what's irrational because I am commanded to. For all their indisputable
intelligence, men take this farce as something serious, and
that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course ... but then they
live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for suffering is life.
Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? It would be
transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but
tedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don't live.
I am x in an indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in
life who has lost all beginning and end, and who has even forgotten
his own name. You are laughing&mdash; no, you are not laughing, you
are angry again. You are for ever angry, all you care about is intelligence,
but I repeat again that I would give away all this super-stellar
life, all the ranks and honors, simply to be transformed into
<pb n='727'/><anchor id='Pg727'/>
the soul of a merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles
at God's shrine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then even you don't believe in God?</q> said Ivan, with a smile of
hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>What can I say?&mdash;that is, if you are in earnest&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there a God or not?</q> Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I
don't know. There! I've said it now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know, but you see God? No, you are not some one
apart, you are myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish,
you are my fancy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would
be true. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Je pense, donc je suis</foreign>,
I know that for a fact; all the rest,
all these worlds, God and even Satan&mdash;all that is not proved, to my
mind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of
myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed
for ever: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping
up to beat me directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better tell me some anecdote!</q> said Ivan miserably.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend,
not an anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say,
yet you don't believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one
like that. We are all in a muddle over there now and all through
your science. Once there used to be atoms, five senses, four elements,
and then everything hung together somehow. There were
atoms in the ancient world even, but since we've learned that you've
discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil
knows what, we had to lower our crest. There's a regular muddle,
and, above all, superstition, scandal; there's as much scandal among
us as among you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed,
for we have our secret police department where private information
is received. Well, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages&mdash;not
yours, but ours&mdash;and no one believes it even among us, except
the old ladies of eighteen stone, not your old ladies I mean, but ours.
We've everything you have, I am revealing one of our secrets out
of friendship for you; though it's forbidden. This legend is about
Paradise. There was, they say, here on earth a thinker and philosopher.
He rejected everything, <q>laws, conscience, faith,</q> and,
<pb n='728'/><anchor id='Pg728'/>
above all, the future life. He died; he expected to go straight to
darkness and death and he found a future life before him. He was
astounded and indignant. <q>This is against my principles!</q> he said.
And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me,
I am just repeating what I heard myself, it's only a legend ...
he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (we've
adopted the metric system, you know) and when he has finished
that quadrillion, the gates of heaven would be opened to him and
he'll be forgiven&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what tortures have you in the other world besides the
quadrillion kilometers?</q> asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.
</p>

<p>
<q>What tortures? Ah, don't ask. In old days we had all sorts,
but now they have taken chiefly to moral punishments&mdash;<q>the stings
of conscience</q> and all that nonsense. We got that, too, from you,
from the softening of your manners. And who's the better for it?
Only those who have got no conscience, for how can they be tortured
by conscience when they have none? But decent people who
have conscience and a sense of honor suffer for it. Reforms, when
the ground has not been prepared for them, especially if they are
institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but mischief! The
ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemned to
the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down
across the road. <q>I won't go, I refuse on principle!</q> Take the soul
of an enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the
prophet Jonah, who sulked for three days and nights in the belly
of the whale, and you get the character of that thinker who lay
across the road.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he lie on there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not
laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo!</q> cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now
he was listening with an unexpected curiosity. <q>Well, is he lying
there now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's the point, that he isn't. He lay there almost a thousand
years and then he got up and went on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What an ass!</q> cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming
to be pondering something intently. <q>Does it make any difference
<pb n='729'/><anchor id='Pg729'/>
whether he lies there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers?
It would take a billion years to walk it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Much more than that. I haven't got a pencil and paper or I
could work it out. But he got there long ago, and that's where
the story begins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to
do it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present
earth may have been repeated a billion times. Why, it's become
extinct, been frozen; cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into
its elements, again <q>the water above the firmament,</q> then again a
comet, again a sun, again from the sun it becomes earth&mdash;and the
same sequence may have been repeated endlessly and exactly the
same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably tedious&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well, what happened when he arrived?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked
in, before he had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to
my thinking his watch must have long dissolved into its elements on
the way), he cried out that those two seconds were worth walking
not a quadrillion kilometers but a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised
to the quadrillionth power! In fact, he sang <q>hosannah</q> and overdid
it so, that some persons there of lofty ideas wouldn't shake hands
with him at first&mdash;he'd become too rapidly reactionary, they said.
The Russian temperament. I repeat, it's a legend. I give it for
what it's worth. So that's the sort of ideas we have on such subjects
even now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've caught you!</q> Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight,
as though he had succeeded in remembering something at last.
<q>That anecdote about the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I
was seventeen then, I was at the high school. I made up that
anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin, it was at
Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic that I couldn't have
taken it from anywhere. I thought I'd forgotten it ... but I've
unconsciously recalled it&mdash;I recalled it myself&mdash;it was not you
telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like
that even when people are being taken to execution ... it's come
back to me in a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream,
not a living creature!</q>
</p>

<pb n='730'/><anchor id='Pg730'/>

<p>
<q>From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,</q>
laughed the gentleman, <q>I am convinced that you believe in me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not in the slightest! I haven't a hundredth part of a grain of
faith in you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses
perhaps are the strongest. Confess that you have faith even to the
ten-thousandth of a grain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not for one minute,</q> cried Ivan furiously. <q>But I should like to
believe in you,</q> he added strangely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aha! There's an admission! But I am good-natured. I'll come
to your assistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me.
I told you your anecdote you'd forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy
your faith in me completely.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of
your existence!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and
disbelief&mdash;is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as
you are, that it's better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you
are inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling
you that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and
I have my motive in it. It's the new method. As soon as you disbelieve
in me completely, you'll begin assuring me to my face that
I am not a dream but a reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained
my object, which is an honorable one. I shall sow in you
only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree&mdash;and
such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will long to enter the ranks
of <q>the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women,</q> for that
is what you are secretly longing for. You'll dine on locusts, you'll
wander into the wilderness to save your soul!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then it's for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it,
you scoundrel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you
are!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and
prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown
with moss?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I've done nothing else. One forgets the whole
world and all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he
<pb n='731'/><anchor id='Pg731'/>
is a very precious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes
worth a whole constellation. We have our system of reckoning, you
know. The conquest is priceless! And some of them, on my word,
are not inferior to you in culture, though you won't believe it.
They can contemplate such depths of belief and disbelief at the same
moment that sometimes it really seems that they are within a hair's-breadth
of being <q>turned upside down,</q> as the actor Gorbunov says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, did you get your nose pulled?</q><note place='foot'>Literally: <q>Did you
get off with a long nose made at you?</q>&mdash;a proverbial
expression in Russia for failure.</note>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow,</q> observed the visitor sententiously, <q>it's better
to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an
afflicted marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated
by a specialist) in confession to his spiritual father&mdash;a Jesuit. I was
present, it was simply charming. <q>Give me back my nose!</q> he said,
and he beat his breast. <q>My son,</q> said the priest evasively, <q>all things
are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of
Providence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary,
though unapparent, benefits. If stern destiny has deprived
you of your nose, it's to your advantage that no one can ever pull
you by your nose.</q> <q>Holy father, that's no comfort,</q> cried the
despairing marquis. <q>I'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every
day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.</q> <q>My son,</q> sighs
the priest, <q>you can't expect every blessing at once. This is murmuring
against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you,
for if you repine as you repined just now, declaring you'd be glad
to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has
already been fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you
were led by the nose.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool, how stupid!</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that's
the genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word
for word as I've told you. It happened lately and gave me a great
deal of trouble. The unhappy young man shot himself that very
night when he got home. I was by his side till the very last moment.
Those Jesuit confessionals are really my most delightful
diversion at melancholy moments. Here's another incident that happened
only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of twenty&mdash;a
<pb n='732'/><anchor id='Pg732'/>
buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth
water&mdash;comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her
sin into the grating. <q>Why, my daughter, have you fallen again
already?</q> cries the priest. <q>O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not
the same man this time, how long is this going on? Aren't you
ashamed!</q> <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ah, mon père</foreign>,</q>
answers the sinner with tears of penitence, <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ça
lui fait tant de plaisir, et à moi si peu de peine!</foreign></q> Fancy,
such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of nature, better
than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on the spot and
was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the priest
at the grating making an appointment with her for the evening&mdash;though
he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! It was
nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turning
up your nose again? Angry again? I don't know how to
please you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting
nightmare,</q> Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition.
<q>I am bored with you, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give
anything to be able to shake you off!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand of me
<q>everything great and noble</q> and you'll see how well we shall get
on,</q> said the gentleman impressively. <q>You are really angry with
me for not having appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and
lightning, with scorched wings, but have shown myself in such a
modest form. You are wounded, in the first place, in your esthetic
feelings, and, secondly, in your pride. How could such a vulgar
devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is that romantic
strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can't help it,
young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of
appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the
Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I
was positively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me for
daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least,
the Polar Star or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid,
but, mercy on us! I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence.
Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil, but did only
good. Well, he can say what he likes, it's quite the opposite with
me. I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth
<pb n='733'/><anchor id='Pg733'/>
and genuinely desires good. I was there when the Word, Who died
on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul
of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim
singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the
seraphim which shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you
by all that's sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah
with them all. The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken
from my lips ... you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable
I am. But common sense&mdash;oh, a most unhappy trait in
my character&mdash;kept me in due bounds and I let the moment pass!
For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have happened
after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been
extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so,
solely from a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced
to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody
takes all the credit of what's good for Himself, and nothing
but nastiness is left for me. But I don't envy the honor of a life
of idle imposture, I am not ambitious. Why am I, of all creatures
in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be
kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such consequences
sometimes? I know, of course, there's a secret in it, but
they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps, seeing
the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable
minus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme
throughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the
end of everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who
would take them in? I know that at the end of all things I shall
be reconciled. I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret.
But till that happens I am sulking and fulfill my destiny though it's
against the grain&mdash;that is, to ruin thousands for the sake of saving
one. How many souls have had to be ruined and how many honorable
reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man,
Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days! Yes, till
the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for me&mdash;one, their
truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the other
my own. And there's no knowing which will turn out the better....
Are you asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I might well be,</q> Ivan groaned angrily. <q>All my stupid ideas&mdash;outgrown,
<pb n='734'/><anchor id='Pg734'/>
thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead
carcass&mdash;you present to me as something new!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you
by my literary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn't bad,
was it? And then that ironical tone <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à la</foreign>
Heine, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget
a flunkey like you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young
Russian gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature
and art, the author of a promising poem entitled
<hi rend='italic'>The Grand Inquisitor</hi>.
I was only thinking of him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I forbid you to speak of <hi rend='italic'>The Grand Inquisitor</hi>,</q>
cried Ivan, crimson with shame.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the <hi rend='italic'>Geological Cataclysm</hi>. Do you remember? That was
a poem, now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, or I'll kill you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat
myself to that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young
friends, quivering with eagerness for life! <q>There are new men,</q>
you decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, <q>they
propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid
fellows! they didn't ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need
be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man,
that's how we have to set to work. It's that, that we must begin
with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon
as men have all of them denied God&mdash;and I believe that period,
analogous with geological periods, will come to pass&mdash;the old conception
of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and,
what's more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew.
Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy
and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up with a
spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From
hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will
and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in
doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of
heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept
death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that
it's useless for him to repine at life's being a moment, and he will
<pb n='735'/><anchor id='Pg735'/>
love his brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient
only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness
will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams
of eternal love beyond the grave</q>... and so on and so on in the
same style. Charming!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his
ears, but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible
that such a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined
and humanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man's
inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand
years, every one who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately
order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, <q>all
things are lawful</q> for him. What's more, even if this period never
comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality,
the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is the only
one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position, he may
lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old
slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God
stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost
place ... <q>all things are lawful</q> and that's the end of it!
That's all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you
want a moral sanction for doing it? But that's our modern Russian
all over. He can't bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction.
He is so in love with truth&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence,
speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But
he did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from
the table and flung it at the orator.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ah, mais c'est bête enfin</foreign>,</q>
cried the latter, jumping up from the
sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. <q>He remembers
Luther's inkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at
a dream! It's like a woman! I suspected you were only pretending
to stop up your ears.</q>
</p>

<p>
A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window.
Ivan jumped up from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you hear? You'd better open,</q> cried the visitor; <q>it's your
<pb n='736'/><anchor id='Pg736'/>
brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I'll
be bound!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming,
and of course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings
<q>news,</q></q> Ivan exclaimed frantically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Open, open to him. There's a snowstorm and he is your brother.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait?
C'est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window,
but something seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained
every effort to break his chains, but in vain. The knocking at the
window grew louder and louder. At last the chains were broken
and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked round him wildly.
Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just thrown at
his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one on
the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on
persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his
dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened
just now!</q> cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened
the movable pane.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I told you not to come,</q> he cried fiercely to his brother.
<q>In two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,</q> Alyosha answered
from the yard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come round to the steps, I'll open at once,</q> said Ivan, going to
open the door to Alyosha.

<head>Chapter X. <q>It Was He Who Said That</q></head>

<p>
Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago
Marya Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him
Smerdyakov had taken his own life. <q>I went in to clear away the
samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall.</q> On Alyosha's
inquiring whether she had informed the police, she answered that
<pb n='737'/><anchor id='Pg737'/>
she had told no one, <q>but I flew straight to you, I've run all the
way.</q> She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking
like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he found
Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: <q>I destroy my
life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.</q>
Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police
captain and told him all about it. <q>And from him I've come straight
to you,</q> said Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's
face. He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as
though struck by something in his expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> he cried suddenly, <q>you must be terribly ill. You
look and don't seem to understand what I tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a good thing you came,</q> said Ivan, as though brooding, and
not hearing Alyosha's exclamation. <q>I knew he had hanged himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me.
He told me so just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same
brooding tone, looking at the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is <emph>he</emph>?</q> asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's slipped away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a <q>pure
cherub.</q> Dmitri calls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous
rapture of the seraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole
constellation. But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical
molecule. There's a constellation of the Lion and the Sun. Don't
you know it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, sit down,</q> said Alyosha in alarm. <q>For goodness' sake,
sit down on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow,
that's right. Would you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps
it will do you good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down
there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not here. Don't worry yourself. I know where it is&mdash;here,</q>
said Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused,
by Ivan's dressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan
<pb n='738'/><anchor id='Pg738'/>
looked strangely at the towel: recollection seemed to come back to
him for an instant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay</q>&mdash;he got up from the sofa&mdash;<q>an hour ago I took that new
towel from there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and
threw it down here ... How is it it's dry? There was no other.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You put that towel on your head?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ...
Why have the candles burnt down so? What's the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nearly twelve.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, no!</q> Ivan cried suddenly. <q>It was not a dream. He
was here; he was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked
at the window, I threw a glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute.
I was asleep last time, but this dream was not a dream. It has
happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha ... yet they are
not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ... though I
am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is
frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.</q> Ivan laughed suddenly
and began pacing about the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?</q> Alyosha
asked anxiously again.
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil! He's taken to visiting me. He's been here twice,
almost three times. He taunted me with being angry at his being
a simple devil and not Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and
lightning. But he is not Satan: that's a lie. He is an impostor.
He is simply a devil&mdash;a paltry, trivial devil. He goes to the baths.
If you undressed him, you'd be sure to find he had a tail, long and
smooth like a Danish dog's, a yard long, dun color.... Alyosha,
you are cold. You've been in the snow. Would you like some tea?
What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some?
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est à ne pas
mettre un chien dehors.</foreign>...</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded
Ivan to sit down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He
sat down beside him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What were you telling me just now about Lise?</q> Ivan began
again. (He was becoming very talkative.) <q>I like Lise. I said
something nasty about her. It was a lie. I like her ... I am
afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more afraid of her than of anything.
On account of the future. She will cast me off to-morrow
<pb n='739'/><anchor id='Pg739'/>
and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining Mitya
from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it's not
so. To-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan't hang
myself. Do you know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it
because I am base? I am not a coward. Is it from love of life?
How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself? Yes, it was
<emph>he</emph> told me so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?</q>
asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him
away. You did drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived.
I love your face, Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face?
And <emph>he</emph> is myself, Alyosha. All that's base in me, all that's mean and
contemptible. Yes, I am a romantic. He guessed it ... though
it's a libel. He is frightfully stupid; but it's to his advantage. He
has cunning, animal cunning&mdash;he knew how to infuriate me. He
kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was how he made
me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great
deal that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned
it to myself. Do you know, Alyosha,</q> Ivan added in an intensely
earnest and confidential tone, <q>I should be awfully glad to think
that it was <emph>he</emph> and not I.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has worn you out,</q> said Alyosha, looking compassionately at
his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so
cleverly. <q>Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for
myself. Why am I tormented by it? From habit. From the
universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years. So let
us give it up, and we shall be gods.</q> It was he said that, it was he
said that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And not you, not you?</q> Alyosha could not help crying, looking
frankly at his brother. <q>Never mind him, anyway; have done
with him and forget him. And let him take with him all that you
curse now, and never come back!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent,
Alyosha,</q> Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. <q>But he was unfair
to me, unfair to me about lots of things. He told lies about me to
my face. <q>Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue:
<pb n='740'/><anchor id='Pg740'/>
to confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him
at your instigation.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> Alyosha interposed, <q>restrain yourself. It was not
you murdered him. It's not true!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what he says, he, and he knows it. <q>You are going to
perform an act of heroic virtue, and you don't believe in virtue;
that's what tortures you and makes you angry, that's why you are
so vindictive.</q> He said that to me about me and he knows what
he says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's you say that, not he,</q> exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, <q>and
you say it because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, he knows what he says. <q>You are going from pride,</q> he
says. <q>You'll stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you
writhe with horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise
your horror!</q> He said that about me. <q>And do you know you are
longing for their praise&mdash;<q>he is a criminal, a murderer, but what a
generous soul; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed.</q></q>
That's a lie, Alyosha!</q> Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes. <q>I
don't want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I don't! That's a
lie! That's why I threw the glass at him and it broke against his
ugly face.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, calm yourself, stop!</q> Alyosha entreated him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he knows how to torment one. He's cruel,</q> Ivan went on,
unheeding. <q>I had an inkling from the first what he came for.
<q>Granting that you go through pride, still you had a hope that
Smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to Siberia, and Mitya
would be acquitted, while you would only be punished with moral
condemnation</q> (<q>Do you hear?</q> he laughed then)&mdash;<q>and some people
will praise you. But now Smerdyakov's dead, he has hanged himself,
and who'll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you are going,
you'll go all the same, you've decided to go. What are you going
for now?</q> That's awful, Alyosha. I can't endure such questions.
Who dare ask me such questions?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> interposed Alyosha&mdash;his heart sank with terror, but
he still seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason&mdash;<q>how could he
have told you of Smerdyakov's death before I came, when no one
knew of it and there was no time for any one to know of it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He told me,</q> said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. <q>It
<pb n='741'/><anchor id='Pg741'/>
was all he did talk about, if you come to that. <q>And it would be all
right if you believed in virtue,</q> he said. <q>No matter if they disbelieve
you, you are going for the sake of principle. But you are a
little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue?
Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to
any one? Because you don't know yourself why you go! Oh,
you'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go! And can you
have made up your mind? You've not made up your mind. You'll
sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go;
you know you'll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the
decision does not depend on you. You'll go because you won't dare
not to go. Why won't you dare? You must guess that for yourself.
That's a riddle for you!</q> He got up and went away. You
came and he went. He called me a coward, Alyosha!
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Le mot de l'énigme</foreign>
is that I am a coward. <q>It is not for such eagles to soar
above the earth.</q> It was he added that&mdash;he! And Smerdyakov said
the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I've seen that
for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! <q>You are
going in order to be praised.</q> That's a brutal lie! And you despise
me too, Alyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate
the monster, too! I hate the monster! I don't want to save the
monster. Let him rot in Siberia! He's begun singing a hymn!
Oh, to-morrow I'll go, stand before them, and spit in their faces!</q>
</p>

<p>
He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing
up and down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just
said. <q>I seem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but
I am asleep.</q> It seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did not
leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a
doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no
one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness
completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but
quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty.
Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support
him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed him
somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another
two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring,
breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on
the sofa, without undressing.
</p>

<pb n='742'/><anchor id='Pg742'/>

<p>
As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to
understand Ivan's illness. <q>The anguish of a proud determination.
An earnest conscience!</q> God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His
truth were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to
submit. <q>Yes,</q> the thought floated through Alyosha's head as it lay
on the pillow, <q>yes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe
Ivan's evidence; but he will go and give it.</q> Alyosha smiled softly.
<q>God will conquer!</q> he thought. <q>He will either rise up in the
light of truth, or ... he'll perish in hate, revenging on himself
and on every one his having served the cause he does not believe in,</q>
Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.

<head>Chapter I. The Fatal Day</head>

<p>
At ten o'clock in the morning of the day following the events I
have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our
district court.
</p>

<p>
I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself
capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail,
or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention
everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very
large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining
myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most interest
what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most
prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better not to
apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself
that I have done all I can.
</p>

<p>
And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention
what surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later,
every one was surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had
aroused great interest, that every one was burning with impatience
for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture,
exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society.
Every one knew, too, that the case had become known throughout
Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning,
such intense, interest in every one, not only among ourselves,
but all over Russia. This became evident at the trial this day.
</p>

<p>
Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province,
but from several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and
Petersburg. Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several
distinguished personages. Every ticket of admission had been
<pb n='744'/><anchor id='Pg744'/>
snatched up. A special place behind the table at which the three
judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and important
of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs had been placed there&mdash;something
exceptional, which had never been allowed before. A
large proportion&mdash;not less than half of the public&mdash;were ladies.
There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they
did not know where to seat them, for every ticket had long since
been eagerly sought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the
room, behind the platform, a special partition hurriedly put up,
behind which all these lawyers were admitted, and they thought
themselves lucky to have standing room there, for all chairs had
been removed for the sake of space, and the crowd behind the partition
stood throughout the case closely packed, shoulder to shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance,
made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the
majority of the ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed
hysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar fact&mdash;established
afterwards by many observations&mdash;was that almost
all the ladies, or, at least the vast majority of them, were on Mitya's
side and in favor of his being acquitted. This was perhaps chiefly
owing to his reputation as a conqueror of female hearts. It was
known that two women rivals were to appear in the case. One of
them&mdash;Katerina Ivanovna&mdash;was an object of general interest. All
sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes
of her passion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and <q>aristocratic
connections</q> were particularly insisted upon (she had
called upon scarcely any one in the town). People said she intended
to petition the Government for leave to accompany the criminal
to Siberia and to be married to him somewhere in the mines. The
appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited with no less impatience.
The public was looking forward with anxious curiosity to
the meeting of the two rivals&mdash;the proud aristocratic girl and <q>the
hetaira.</q> But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies
of the district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen <q>the
woman who had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,</q>
and all, almost without exception, wondered how father and son
could be so in love with <q>such a very common, ordinary Russian
girl, who was not even pretty.</q>
</p>

<pb n='745'/><anchor id='Pg745'/>

<p>
In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that
there were several serious family quarrels on Mitya's account in
our town. Many ladies quarreled violently with their husbands over
differences of opinion about the dreadful case, and it was only
natural that the husbands of these ladies, far from being favorably
disposed to the prisoner, should enter the court bitterly prejudiced
against him. In fact, one may say pretty certainly that the masculine,
as distinguished from the feminine, part of the audience were
biased against the prisoner. There were numbers of severe, frowning,
even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to offend
many people during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were,
of course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate
of Mitya personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the
majority of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the
criminal, except perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in
the legal than in the moral aspect of the case.
</p>

<p>
Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,
Fetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the
first time he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces.
And if he defended them, such cases became celebrated and long
remembered all over Russia. There were stories, too, about our
prosecutor and about the President of the Court. It was said that
Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and
that they had been enemies from the beginning of their careers in
Petersburg, that though our sensitive prosecutor, who always considered
that he had been aggrieved by some one in Petersburg because
his talents had not been properly appreciated, was keenly
excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of rebuilding
his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said,
was his one anxiety. But these rumors were not quite just. Our
prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger.
On the contrary, his self-confidence increased with the increase
of danger. It must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too
hasty and morbidly impressionable. He would put his whole soul
into some case and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole
fortune depended on its result. This was the subject of some ridicule
in the legal world, for just by this characteristic our prosecutor
had gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected
<pb n='746'/><anchor id='Pg746'/>
from his modest position. People laughed particularly at his passion
for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor
was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally
supposed. But with his delicate health he had failed to make his
mark at the outset of his career and had never made up for it later.
</p>

<p>
As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a
humane and cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his
work and progressive views. He was rather ambitious, but did not
concern himself greatly about his future career. The great aim of
his life was to be a man of advanced ideas. He was, too, a man
of connections and property. He felt, as we learnt afterwards,
rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a social, not
from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a social phenomenon,
in its classification and its character as a product of our
social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on, and
so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragic
significance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner,
was rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.
</p>

<p>
The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges
made their appearance. Our court is the best hall in the town&mdash;spacious,
lofty, and good for sound. On the right of the judges,
who were on a raised platform, a table and two rows of chairs had
been put ready for the jury. On the left was the place for the
prisoner and the counsel for the defense. In the middle of the court,
near the judges, was a table with the <q>material proofs.</q> On it lay
Fyodor Pavlovitch's white silk dressing-gown, stained with blood;
the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been
committed; Mitya's shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat,
stained with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put
his handkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by
now quite yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin's with a
view to suicide, and taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon
Borissovitch; the envelope in which the three thousand roubles had
been put ready for Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which
it had been tied, and many other articles I don't remember. In the
body of the hall, at some distance, came the seats for the public.
But in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for
witnesses who remained in the court after giving their evidence.
</p>

<pb n='747'/><anchor id='Pg747'/>

<p>
At ten o'clock the three judges arrived&mdash;the President, one
honorary justice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of
course, entered immediately after. The President was a short, stout,
thick-set man of fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair
turning gray and cut short, and a red ribbon, of what Order I don't
remember. The prosecutor struck me and the others, too, as looking
particularly pale, almost green. His face seemed to have grown
suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I had seen him looking
as usual only two days before. The President began with asking
the court whether all the jury were present.
</p>

<p>
But I see I can't go on like this, partly because some things I did
not hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but
most of all because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or
space to mention everything that was said and done. I only know
that neither side objected to very many of the jurymen. I remember
the twelve jurymen&mdash;four were petty officials of the town, two were
merchants, and six peasants and artisans of the town. I remember,
long before the trial, questions were continually asked with some
surprise, especially by ladies: <q>Can such a delicate, complex and
psychological case be submitted for decision to petty officials and
even peasants?</q> and <q>What can an official, still more a peasant,
understand in such an affair?</q> All the four officials in the jury were,
in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank. Except one who
was rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in
society, who had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably
had elderly, unpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps
even without shoes and stockings. At most, they spent their leisure
over cards and, of course, had never read a single book. The two
merchants looked respectable, but were strangely silent and stolid.
One of them was close-shaven, and was dressed in European style;
the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a red ribbon with some
sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need to speak of the
artisans and the peasants. The artisans of Skotoprigonyevsk are
almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of them also wore
European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier and more
uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might well wonder,
as I did as soon as I had looked at them, <q>what men like that could
possibly make of such a case?</q> Yet their faces made a strangely
<pb n='748'/><anchor id='Pg748'/>
imposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and
frowning.
</p>

<p>
At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor
Pavlovitch Karamazov. I don't quite remember how he described
him. The court usher was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya
made his appearance. There was a hush through the court. One
could have heard a fly. I don't know how it was with others, but
Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. He looked an
awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards that he
had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own
tailor, who had his measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves
and exquisite linen. He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking
stiffly straight in front of him, and sat down in his place with
a most unperturbed air.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated
Fetyukovitch, entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through
the court. He was a tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with
extremely long, thin, pale fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely
brushed, rather short hair, and thin lips that were at times curved
into something between a sneer and a smile. He looked about forty.
His face would have been pleasant, if it had not been for his eyes,
which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set remarkably
close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing line between
them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike
about his face. He was in evening dress and white tie.
</p>

<p>
I remember the President's first questions to Mitya, about his
name, his calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice
was so unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look
at the prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who
were to take part in the proceedings&mdash;that is, of the witnesses and
experts. It was a long list. Four of the witnesses were not present&mdash;Miüsov,
who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but
was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and Maximov, who were
absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his sudden death,
of which an official statement from the police was presented. The
news of Smerdyakov's death produced a sudden stir and whisper in
the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of the
sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya's sudden outburst
<pb n='749'/><anchor id='Pg749'/>
As soon as the statement of Smerdyakov's death was made,
he cried out aloud from his place:
</p>

<p>
<q>He was a dog and died like a dog!</q>
</p>

<p>
I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President
addressed him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an
irregularity were repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice
repeated several times abruptly to his counsel, with no show of
regret:
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't again, I won't. It escaped me. I won't do it again.</q>
</p>

<p>
And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury
or the public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself.
It was under the influence of this incident that the opening statement
was read. It was rather short, but circumstantial. It only
stated the chief reasons why he had been arrested, why he must be
tried, and so on. Yet it made a great impression on me. The clerk
read it loudly and distinctly. The whole tragedy was suddenly
unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless
light. I remember how, immediately after it had been read, the
President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Prisoner, do you plead guilty?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,</q> he exclaimed,
again in a startling, almost frenzied, voice, <q>to idleness and debauchery.
I meant to become an honest man for good, just at the moment
when I was struck down by fate. But I am not guilty of the
death of that old man, my enemy and my father. No, no, I am not
guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri Karamazov is a
scoundrel, but not a thief.</q>
</p>

<p>
He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President
again briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what
was asked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he
ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take
the oath. Then I saw them all together. The brothers of the
prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without taking the
oath. After an exhortation from the priest and the President, the
witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible
apart from one another. Then they began calling them up one
by one.

<head>Chapter II. Dangerous Witnesses</head>

<p>
I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the
prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and
whether it was arranged to call them in a certain order. But no
doubt it was so. I only know that the witnesses for the prosecution
were called first. I repeat I don't intend to describe all the
questions step by step. Besides, my account would be to some extent
superfluous, because in the speeches for the prosecution and for the
defense the whole course of the evidence was brought together and
set in a strong and significant light, and I took down parts of those
two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote them in due course,
together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected episode, which
occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedly influenced the
sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.
</p>

<p>
I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one
peculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed
by all, that is, the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as
compared with the arguments the defense had to rely upon. Every
one realized it from the first moment that the facts began to group
themselves round a single point, and the whole horrible and bloody
crime was gradually revealed. Every one, perhaps, felt from the
first that the case was beyond dispute, that there was no doubt about
it, that there could be really no discussion, and that the defense
was only a matter of form, and that the prisoner was guilty, obviously
and conclusively guilty. I imagine that even the ladies, who
were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the interesting
prisoner, were at the same time, without exception, convinced of his
guilt. What's more, I believe they would have been mortified if his
guilt had not been so firmly established, as that would have lessened
the effect of the closing scene of the criminal's acquittal. That he
would be acquitted, all the ladies, strange to say, were firmly persuaded
up to the very last moment. <q>He is guilty, but he will be
acquitted, from motives of humanity, in accordance with the new
ideas, the new sentiments that had come into fashion,</q> and so on,
<pb n='751'/><anchor id='Pg751'/>
and so on. And that was why they had crowded into the court so
impatiently. The men were more interested in the contest between
the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch. All were wondering
and asking themselves what could even a talent like Fetyukovitch's
make of such a desperate case; and so they followed his achievements,
step by step, with concentrated attention.
</p>

<p>
But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end,
up to his speech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some
design, that he was working towards some object, but it was almost
impossible to guess what it was. His confidence and self-reliance
were unmistakable, however. Every one noticed with pleasure,
moreover, that he, after so short a stay, not more than three days,
perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeeded in mastering the
case and <q>had studied it to a nicety.</q> People described with relish,
afterwards, how cleverly he had <q>taken down</q> all the witnesses for
the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed them and, what's
more, had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of
their evidence. But it was supposed that he did this rather by way
of sport, so to speak, for professional glory, to show nothing had
been omitted of the accepted methods, for all were convinced that he
could do no real good by such disparagement of the witnesses, and
probably was more aware of this than any one, having some idea of
his own in the background, some concealed weapon of defense,
which he would suddenly reveal when the time came. But meanwhile,
conscious of his strength, he seemed to be diverting himself.
</p>

<p>
So, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch's old servant,
who had given the most damning piece of evidence about the open
door, was examined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened
upon him when his turn came to question him. It must be noted
that Grigory entered the hall with a composed and almost stately
air, not the least disconcerted by the majesty of the court or the
vast audience listening to him. He gave evidence with as much confidence
as though he had been talking with his Marfa, only perhaps
more respectfully. It was impossible to make him contradict himself.
The prosecutor questioned him first in detail about the family
life of the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in lurid colors.
It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and
impartial. In spite of his profound reverence for the memory of his
<pb n='752'/><anchor id='Pg752'/>
deceased master, he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to
Mitya and <q>hadn't brought up his children as he should. He'd have
been devoured by lice when he was little, if it hadn't been for me,</q>
he added, describing Mitya's early childhood. <q>It wasn't fair either
of the father to wrong his son over his mother's property, which was
by right his.</q>
</p>

<p>
In reply to the prosecutor's question what grounds he had for
asserting that Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money
relations, Grigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all
to bring forward, but he still persisted that the arrangement with
the son was <q>unfair,</q> and that he ought <q>to have paid him several
thousand roubles more.</q> I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor
asked this question whether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept
back part of Mitya's inheritance with marked persistence of all the
witnesses who could be asked it, not excepting Alyosha and Ivan,
but he obtained no exact information from any one; all alleged that
it was so, but were unable to bring forward any distinct proof.
Grigory's description of the scene at the dinner-table, when Dmitri
had burst in and beaten his father, threatening to come back to kill
him, made a sinister impression on the court, especially as the old
servant's composure in telling it, his parsimony of words and peculiar
phraseology, were as effective as eloquence. He observed that
he was not angry with Mitya for having knocked him down and
struck him on the face; he had forgiven him long ago, he said. Of
the deceased Smerdyakov he observed, crossing himself, that he was
a lad of ability, but stupid and afflicted, and, worse still, an infidel,
and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch and his elder son who had taught
him to be so. But he defended Smerdyakov's honesty almost with
warmth, and related how Smerdyakov had once found the master's
money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it, had taken it to his
master, who had rewarded him with a <q>gold piece</q> for it, and trusted
him implicitly from that time forward. He maintained obstinately
that the door into the garden had been open. But he was asked so
many questions that I can't recall them all.
</p>

<p>
At last the counsel for the defense began to cross-examine him,
and the first question he asked was about the envelope in which
Fyodor Pavlovitch was supposed to have put three thousand roubles
for <q>a certain person.</q> <q>Have you ever seen it, you, who were for
<pb n='753'/><anchor id='Pg753'/>
so many years in close attendance on your master?</q> Grigory
answered that he had not seen it and had never heard of the money
from any one <q>till everybody was talking about it.</q> This question
about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to every one who could conceivably
have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutor asked his
question about Dmitri's inheritance, and got the same answer from
all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of it.
From the beginning every one noticed Fetyukovitch's persistence on
this subject.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, with your permission I'll ask you a question,</q> Fetyukovitch
said, suddenly and unexpectedly. <q>Of what was that balsam,
or, rather, decoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary
inquiry, you used on that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope
of curing it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silence
muttered, <q>There was saffron in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing but saffron? Don't you remember any other ingredient?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There was milfoil in it, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And pepper perhaps?</q> Fetyukovitch queried.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there was pepper, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Etcetera. And all dissolved in vodka?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a faint sound of laughter in the court.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, in spirit. After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank
what was left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known
to your wife?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It might have been a tumbler-full.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.
</p>

<p>
<q>A glass and a half of neat spirit&mdash;is not at all bad, don't you
think? You might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door
into the garden?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court.
The President made a movement.
</p>

<pb n='754'/><anchor id='Pg754'/>

<p>
<q>Do you know for a fact,</q> Fetyukovitch persisted, <q>whether
you were awake or not when you saw the open door?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was on my legs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not a proof that you were awake.</q> (There was again
laughter in the court.) <q>Could you have answered at that moment,
if any one had asked you a question&mdash;for instance, what year it is?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor.
Strange to say, it appeared he really did not know what
year it was.
</p>

<p>
<q>But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on
your hands?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a servant,</q> Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct
voice. <q>If my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty
to suffer it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened,
reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions.
Fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he had no more
questions to ask of the witness. The public and the jury, of
course, were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the evidence
of a man who might, while undergoing a certain cure, have
seen <q>the gates of heaven,</q> and who did not even know what year
he was living in. But before Grigory left the box another episode
occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him
whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last
witness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Except about the door, all he has said is true,</q> cried Mitya, in
a loud voice. <q>For combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving
my blows, I thank him. The old man has been honest all his
life and as faithful to my father as seven hundred poodles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Prisoner, be careful in your language,</q> the President admonished
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not a poodle,</q> Grigory muttered.
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, it's I am a poodle myself,</q> cried Mitya. <q>If it's an
insult, I take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and
cruel to him. I was cruel to Æsop too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What Æsop?</q> the President asked sternly again.
</p>

<pb n='755'/><anchor id='Pg755'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and
very sternly to be more careful in his language.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.</q>
</p>

<p>
The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the
evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the
leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great
significance. It appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge
was amazing, he had been everywhere, seen everything, talked to
everybody, knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch
and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it is true, he had only
heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely Mitya's exploits
in the <q>Metropolis,</q> all his compromising doings and sayings,
and told the story of Captain Snegiryov's <q>wisp of tow.</q> But even
Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya's inheritance, and
confined himself to contemptuous generalities.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in
debt to the other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling
things so that no one could make head or tail of it?</q> He attributed
the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of
serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia, due to the lack of
appropriate institutions. He was, in fact, allowed some latitude of
speech. This was the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what
he could do, and attracted notice. The prosecutor knew that the
witness was preparing a magazine article on the case, and afterwards
in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted some ideas from the article,
showing that he had seen it already. The picture drawn by the
witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly strengthened the
case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakitin's discourse fascinated
the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility of its
ideas. There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he
spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia.
</p>

<p>
But Rakitin, in his youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which
the counsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage.
Answering certain questions about Grushenka, and carried away by
the loftiness of his own sentiments and his success, of which he was,
of course, conscious, he went so far as to speak somewhat contemptuously
of Agrafena Alexandrovna as <q>the kept mistress of Samsonov.</q>
<pb n='756'/><anchor id='Pg756'/>
He would have given a good deal to take back his words
afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it at once. And
it was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having
been able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so
short a time.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to ask,</q> began the counsel for the defense, with
the most affable and even respectful smile, <q>you are, of course, the
same Mr. Rakitin whose pamphlet, <hi rend='italic'>The Life of the Deceased Elder,
Father Zossima</hi>, published by the diocesan authorities, full of profound
and religious reflections and preceded by an excellent and
devout dedication to the bishop, I have just read with such pleasure?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,</q>
muttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and
almost ashamed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, that's excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought
to, take the widest view of every social question. Your most instructive
pamphlet has been widely circulated through the patronage
of the bishop, and has been of appreciable service.... But this is
the chief thing I should like to learn from you. You stated just
now that you were very intimately acquainted with Madame
Svyetlov.</q> (It must be noted that Grushenka's surname was Svyetlov.
I heard it for the first time that day, during the case.)
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young
man ... and who can be responsible for every one he meets?</q> cried
Rakitin, flushing all over.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, I quite understand,</q> cried Fetyukovitch, as though
he, too, were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself. <q>You, like
any other, might well be interested in an acquaintance with a young
and beautiful woman who would readily entertain the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>élite</foreign> of the
youth of the neighborhood, but ... I only wanted to know ...
It has come to my knowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly
anxious a couple of months ago to make the acquaintance of
the younger Karamazov, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and promised you
twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him to her in his monastic
dress. And that actually took place on the evening of the day on
which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the present investigation,
was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov to
Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles from
<pb n='757'/><anchor id='Pg757'/>
Madame Svyetlov as a reward, that's what I wanted to hear from
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was a joke.... I don't see of what interest that can be to
you.... I took it for a joke ... meaning to give it back
later....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you did take&mdash; But you have not given it back yet ...
or have you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's of no consequence,</q> muttered Rakitin, <q>I refuse to
answer such questions.... Of course I shall give it back.</q>
</p>

<p>
The President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no
more questions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box
not absolutely without a stain upon his character. The effect
left by the lofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred, and
Fetyukovitch's expression, as he watched him walk away, seemed to
suggest to the public <q>this is a specimen of the lofty-minded persons
who accuse him.</q> I remember that this incident, too, did not pass
off without an outbreak from Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which
Rakitin had referred to Grushenka, he suddenly shouted <q>Bernard!</q>
When, after Rakitin's cross-examination, the President asked the
prisoner if he had anything to say, Mitya cried loudly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Since I've been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He
is a contemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesn't believe in
God; he took the bishop in!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his
language, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryov's evidence
was a failure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared
in ragged and dirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance
and expert observation of the police officers, he turned out to
be hopelessly drunk. On being asked about Mitya's attack upon
him, he refused to answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>God bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to
me yonder.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha, my little son. <q>Father, father, how he insulted you!</q> He
said that at the stone. Now he is dying....</q>
</p>

<p>
The captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his
knees before the President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the
<pb n='758'/><anchor id='Pg758'/>
laughter of the public. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did
not come off at all.
</p>

<p>
Fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity,
and amazed people more and more by his minute knowledge of the
case. Thus, for example, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression,
of course, very prejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on
his fingers that on his first visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent
three thousand roubles, <q>or very little less. Just think what he
squandered on those gypsy girls alone! And as for our lousy peasants,
it wasn't a case of flinging half a rouble in the street, he made them
presents of twenty-five roubles each, at least, he didn't give them
less. And what a lot of money was simply stolen from him! And
if any one did steal, he did not leave a receipt. How could one
catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all the time?
Our peasants are robbers, you know; they have no care for their
souls. And the way he went on with the girls, our village girls!
They're completely set up since then, I tell you, they used to be
poor.</q> He recalled, in fact, every item of expense and added it all
up. So the theory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the
rest had been put aside in a little bag seemed inconceivable.
</p>

<p>
<q>I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it
with my own eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon
money,</q> cried Trifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy <q>his
betters.</q>
</p>

<p>
When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him, he scarcely tried
to refute his evidence, but began asking him about an incident at
the first carousal at Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey
and another peasant called Akim had picked up on the floor in
the passage a hundred roubles dropped by Mitya when he was drunk,
and had given them to Trifon Borissovitch and received a rouble
each from him for doing so. <q>Well,</q> asked the lawyer, <q>did you
give that hundred roubles back to Mr. Karamazov?</q> Trifon Borissovitch
shuffled in vain.... He was obliged, after the peasants
had been examined, to admit the finding of the hundred roubles,
only adding that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri Fyodorovitch
<q>in perfect honesty, and it's only because his honor was in
liquor at the time, he wouldn't remember it.</q> But, as he had denied
the incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called
<pb n='759'/><anchor id='Pg759'/>
to prove it, his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was
naturally regarded with great suspicion. So one of the most dangerous
witnesses brought forward by the prosecution was again discredited.
</p>

<p>
The same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude
of pride and independence; they vociferated loudly that they
had both been in the service of the Crown, and that <q>Pan Mitya</q>
had offered them three thousand <q>to buy their honor,</q> and that
they had seen a large sum of money in his hands. Pan Mussyalovitch
introduced a terrible number of Polish words into his sentences,
and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the
eyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more
pompous, and ended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch
caught them, too, in his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled,
was forced, in spite of his evasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky
had substituted another pack of cards for the one he had provided,
and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated during the game. Kalganov
confirmed this, and both the Poles left the witness-box with damaged
reputations, amidst laughter from the public.
</p>

<p>
Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most
dangerous witnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on
all of them, and dismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers
and experts were lost in admiration, and were only at a loss to
understand what good purpose could be served by it, for all, I
repeat, felt that the case for the prosecution could not be refuted,
but was growing more and more tragically overwhelming. But from
the confidence of the <q>great magician</q> they saw that he was serene,
and they waited, feeling that <q>such a man</q> had not come from
Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to return unsuccessful.

<head>Chapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of Nuts</head>

<p>
The evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the
prisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not
reckoned much upon it. The medical line of defense had only been
<pb n='760'/><anchor id='Pg760'/>
taken up through the insistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent
for a celebrated doctor from Moscow on purpose. The case for the
defense could, of course, lose nothing by it and might, with luck,
gain something from it. There was, however, an element of comedy
about it, through the difference of opinion of the doctors. The
medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our doctor,
Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two
latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.
</p>

<p>
The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor
Herzenstube. He was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle
height and sturdy build. He was much esteemed and respected
by every one in the town. He was a conscientious doctor and an
excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or Moravian brother, I am not
quite sure which. He had been living amongst us for many years
and behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-hearted and
humane man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing,
visited them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine,
but he was as obstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into
his head, there was no shaking it. Almost every one in the town
was aware, by the way, that the famous doctor had, within the
first two or three days of his presence among us, uttered some
extremely offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube's qualifications.
Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five roubles for a visit,
several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his
arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense. All these
had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube, and
the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme
harshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw
them, <q>Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube?
He, he!</q> Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this,
and now all the three doctors made their appearance, one after
another, to be examined.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of
the prisoner's mental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his
grounds for this opinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality
was not only evident in many of the prisoner's actions in
the past, but was apparent even now at this very moment. When
he was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment,
<pb n='761'/><anchor id='Pg761'/>
the old doctor, with simple-hearted directness, pointed out that the
prisoner on entering the court had <q>an extraordinary air, remarkable
in the circumstances</q>; that he had <q>marched in like a soldier, looking
straight before him, though it would have been more natural
for him to look to the left where, among the public, the ladies
were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex and
must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,</q>
the old man concluded in his peculiar language.
</p>

<p>
I must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was
formed in German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it
had always been a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian
perfectly, better indeed than Russians. And he was very fond of
using Russian proverbs, always declaring that the Russian proverbs
were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world. I
may remark, too, that in conversation, through absent-mindedness
he often forgot the most ordinary words, which sometimes went out
of his head, though he knew them perfectly. The same thing happened,
though, when he spoke German, and at such times he always
waved his hand before his face as though trying to catch the lost
word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he had
found the missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to
have looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement
in the audience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor;
they knew, too, that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious
man of exemplary conduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures.
And so his unexpected observation struck every one as very queer.
</p>

<p>
The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and
emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner's mental condition
abnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and
with erudition of <q>aberration</q> and <q>mania,</q> and argued that, from
all the facts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition
of aberration for several days before his arrest, and, if the
crime had been committed by him, it must, even if he were conscious
of it, have been almost involuntary, as he had not the power
to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.
</p>

<p>
But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania,
which premised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the
future. (It must be noted that I report this in my own words, the
<pb n='762'/><anchor id='Pg762'/>
doctor made use of very learned and professional language.) <q>All
his actions are in contravention of common sense and logic,</q> he
continued. <q>Not to refer to what I have not seen, that is, the
crime itself and the whole catastrophe, the day before yesterday,
while he was talking to me, he had an unaccountably fixed look in
his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh
at. He showed continual and inexplicable irritability, using strange
words, <q>Bernard!</q> <q>Ethics!</q> and others equally inappropriate.</q> But
the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact that the prisoner
could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of which he considered
himself to have been cheated, without extraordinary irritation,
though he could speak comparatively lightly of other misfortunes
and grievances. According to all accounts, he had even in the
past, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was
touched on, flown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to
be a disinterested and not grasping man.
</p>

<p>
<q>As to the opinion of my learned colleague,</q> the Moscow doctor
added ironically in conclusion, <q>that the prisoner would, on entering
the court, have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before
him, I will only say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory,
it is radically unsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner,
on entering the court where his fate will be decided, would not naturally
look straight before him in that fixed way, and that that may
really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition, at the same time
I maintain that he would naturally not look to the left at the ladies,
but, on the contrary, to the right to find his legal adviser, on whose
help all his hopes rest and on whose defense all his future depends.</q>
The doctor expressed his opinion positively and emphatically.
</p>

<p>
But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave
the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the
experts. In his opinion the prisoner was now, and had been all
along, in a perfectly normal condition, and, although he certainly
must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before
his arrest, this might have been due to several perfectly obvious
causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness, and so on. But this
nervous condition would not involve the mental aberration of which
mention had just been made. As to the question whether the prisoner
should have looked to the left or to the right on entering the
<pb n='763'/><anchor id='Pg763'/>
court, <q>in his modest opinion,</q> the prisoner would naturally look
straight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done,
as that was where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were sitting.
So that it was just by looking straight before him that he
showed his perfectly normal state of mind at the present. The
young doctor concluded his <q>modest</q> testimony with some heat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo, doctor!</q> cried Mitya, from his seat, <q>just so!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor's opinion
had a decisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as
appeared afterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor
Herzenstube, when called as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of
use to Mitya. As an old resident in the town who had known the
Karamazov family for years, he furnished some facts of great value
for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though recalling something,
he added:
</p>

<p>
<q>But the poor young man might have had a very different life,
for he had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that
I know. But the Russian proverb says, <q>If a man has one head,
it's good, but if another clever man comes to visit him, it would be
better still, for then there will be two heads and not only one.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One head is good, but two are better,</q> the prosecutor put in
impatiently. He knew the old man's habit of talking slowly and
deliberately, regardless of the impression he was making and of the
delay he was causing, and highly prizing his flat, dull and always
gleefully complacent German wit. The old man was fond of
making jokes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, that's what I say,</q> he went on stubbornly. <q>One
head is good, but two are much better, but he did not meet another
head with wits, and his wits went. Where did they go? I've forgotten
the word.</q> He went on, passing his hand before his eyes,
<q>Oh, yes, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>spazieren</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wandering?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, wandering, that's what I say. Well, his wits went wandering
and fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he
was a grateful and sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well,
a little chap so high, left neglected by his father in the back yard,
when he ran about without boots on his feet, and his little breeches
hanging by one button.</q>
</p>

<pb n='764'/><anchor id='Pg764'/>

<p>
A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest
old man's voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting
something, and caught at it instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I
was forty-five then, and had only just come here. And I was so
sorry for the boy then; I asked myself why shouldn't I buy him a
pound of ... a pound of what? I've forgotten what it's called.
A pound of what children are very fond of, what is it, what is it?</q>
The doctor began waving his hands again. <q>It grows on a tree and
is gathered and given to every one....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Apples?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound....
No, there are a lot of them, and all little. You put them in the
mouth and crack.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nuts?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, nuts, I say so.</q> The doctor repeated in the calmest
way as though he had been at no loss for a word. <q>And I bought
him a pound of nuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound
of nuts before. And I lifted my finger and said to him, <q>Boy,
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Vater</foreign>.</q> He laughed and said,
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Vater</foreign>.</q>...
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Sohn</foreign>.</q> He laughed again and
lisped, <q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Sohn</foreign>.</q>
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der heilige Geist</foreign>.</q>
Then he laughed and said as best he could, <q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der
heilige Geist</foreign>.</q> I went away, and two days after I happened to be
passing, and he shouted to me of himself, <q>Uncle, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott
der Vater, Gott der Sohn</foreign>,</q> and he had only forgotten
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der heilige Geist</foreign>.</q>
But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for him again. But
he was taken away, and I did not see him again. Twenty-three years
passed. I am sitting one morning in my study, a white-haired old
man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man, whom
I should never have recognized, but he held up his finger and said,
laughing, <q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Vater, Gott der
Sohn</foreign>, and <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der heilige Geist</foreign>.
I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of
nuts, for no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the
only one that ever did.</q> And then I remembered my happy youth
and the poor child in the yard, without boots on his feet, and my
heart was touched and I said, <q>You are a grateful young man, for
you have remembered all your life the pound of nuts I bought you
in your childhood.</q> And I embraced him and blessed him. And I
<pb n='765'/><anchor id='Pg765'/>
shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russian
often laughs when he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw
it. And now, alas!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you
saintly man,</q> Mitya cried suddenly.
</p>

<p>
In any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on
the public. But the chief sensation in Mitya's favor was created
by the evidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly.
Indeed, when the witnesses <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
décharge</foreign>, that is, called by the
defense, began giving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly
more favorable to Mitya, and what was particularly striking, this was
a surprise even to the counsel for the defense. But before Katerina
Ivanovna was called, Alyosha was examined, and he recalled a fact
which seemed to furnish positive evidence against one important
point made by the prosecution.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya</head>

<p>
It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was
not required to take the oath, and I remember that both sides
addressed him very gently and sympathetically. It was evident
that his reputation for goodness had preceded him. Alyosha gave
his evidence modestly and with restraint, but his warm sympathy
for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer to one question,
he sketched his brother's character as that of a man, violent-tempered
perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the same
time honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if
necessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for
Grushenka and his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of
late in an intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation
the suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for
the sake of gain, though he recognized that the three thousand roubles
had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that he looked upon
them as part of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father,
and that, indifferent as he was to money as a rule, he could not even
<pb n='766'/><anchor id='Pg766'/>
speak of that three thousand without fury. As for the rivalry of
the two <q>ladies,</q> as the prosecutor expressed it&mdash;that is, of Grushenka
and Katya&mdash;he answered evasively and was even unwilling
to answer one or two questions altogether.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your
father?</q> asked the prosecutor. <q>You can refuse to answer if you
think necessary,</q> he added.
</p>

<p>
<q>He did not tell me so directly,</q> answered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>How so? Did he indirectly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear
that at an extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might
perhaps murder him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you believed him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some
higher feeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has
indeed saved him, for it was not he killed my father,</q> Alyosha said
firmly, in a loud voice that was heard throughout the court.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity
of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your
affection for your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the
whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary
investigation. I won't attempt to conceal from you that it is highly
individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the
prosecution. And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what
facts have led you to this conviction of your brother's innocence and
of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at
the preliminary inquiry?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,</q>
replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. <q>I made no accusation
against Smerdyakov of myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yet you gave evidence against him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told
what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov
before I was examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is
innocent, and if he didn't commit the murder, then&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so
completely persuaded of your brother's innocence?</q>
</p>

<pb n='767'/><anchor id='Pg767'/>

<p>
<q>I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn't lie to
me. I saw from his face he wasn't lying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no other proof.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof whatever but
your brother's word and the expression of his face?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I have no other proof.</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The
impression left by Alyosha's evidence on the public was most disappointing.
There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial;
some one had heard something, some one had pointed out something
else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary
proofs of his brother's innocence and Smerdyakov's guilt, and
after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions
so natural in a brother.
</p>

<p>
But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking
Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred
for his father and that he might kill him, and whether he had heard
it, for instance, at their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha
started as he answered, as though only just recollecting and
understanding something.
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten
myself. It wasn't clear to me at the time, but now&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he
recounted eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening
under the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck
himself on the breast, <q>the upper part of the breast,</q> and had repeated
several times that he had a means of regaining his honor,
that that means was here, here on his breast. <q>I thought, when he
struck himself on the breast, he meant that it was in his heart,</q>
Alyosha continued, <q>that he might find in his heart strength to save
himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him and
which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did
think at the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the
disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going to our
father and doing some violence to him. Yet it was just then that
he pointed to something on his breast, so that I remember the idea
struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the
<pb n='768'/><anchor id='Pg768'/>
breast, but below, and that he struck himself much too high, just
below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My idea seemed
silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to that
little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so,</q> Mitya cried from his place. <q>That's right, Alyosha,
it was the little bag I struck with my fist.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep
quiet, and at the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried
away himself by his recollection, warmly expressed his theory
that this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles
on him, which he might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half
of what he owed her, but which he had yet determined not to repay
her and to use for another purpose&mdash;namely, to enable him to elope
with Grushenka, if she consented.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is so, it must be so,</q> exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement.
<q>My brother cried several times that half of the disgrace,
half of it (he said <emph>half</emph> several times) he could free himself from at
once, but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of will that he
wouldn't do it ... that he knew beforehand he was incapable of
doing it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself
just on this part of the breast?</q> Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, <q>Why does
he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down?</q> and the
thought seemed stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming
stupid ... it flashed through my mind. That's what brought
it back to me just now. How could I have forgotten it till now?
It was that little bag he meant when he said he had the means but
wouldn't give back that fifteen hundred. And when he was arrested
at Mokroe he cried out&mdash;I know, I was told it&mdash;that he
considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had
the means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he
owed her, he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and
preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And
what torture, what torture that debt has been to him!</q> Alyosha
exclaimed in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to
describe once more how it had all happened, and several times insisted
<pb n='769'/><anchor id='Pg769'/>
on the question, <q>Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything?
Perhaps he had simply struck himself with his fist on the
breast?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it was not with his fist,</q> cried Alyosha; <q>he pointed with
his fingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have
so completely forgotten it till this moment?</q>
</p>

<p>
The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness's
evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing
to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just
below the neck, and that that was, of course, the disgrace, <q>A disgrace
I cannot deny, the most shameful act of my whole life,</q> cried
Mitya. <q>I might have repaid it and didn't repay it. I preferred
to remain a thief in her eyes rather than give it back. And the
most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I shouldn't
give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!</q>
</p>

<p>
So Alyosha's cross-examination ended. What was important and
striking about it was that one fact at least had been found, and even
though this were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence,
it did go some little way towards proving that the bag had
existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the
prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he
alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were <q>his own.</q>
Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved away to the seat
assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: <q>How was it I
forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come
back to me now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered
something extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched
their lorgnettes and opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men:
some stood up to get a better view. Everybody alleged afterwards
that Mitya had turned <q>white as a sheet</q> on her entrance. All in
black, she advanced modestly, almost timidly. It was impossible to
tell from her face that she was agitated; but there was a resolute
gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark that many people
mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that moment.
She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over
the court. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried
to appear composed. The President began his examination discreetly
<pb n='770'/><anchor id='Pg770'/>
and very respectfully, as though afraid to touch on <q>certain
chords,</q> and showing consideration for her great unhappiness. But
in answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied
firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, <q>until
he left me of his own accord...</q> she added quietly. When they
asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to
post to her relations, she said firmly, <q>I didn't give him the money
simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need
of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the understanding
that he should post it within the month if he cared to. There
was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.</q>
</p>

<p>
I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers
in detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon
as he got money from his father,</q> she went on. <q>I have never
doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous
honesty ... in money matters. He felt quite certain that he
would receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several
times about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have
always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father. I
don't remember any threat uttered by him against his father. He
certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come
to me at that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about
that unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming
to see me ... and I myself was put in such a position ... that
I could not invite him.... And I had no right, indeed, to be
exacting as to that money,</q> she added suddenly, and there was a
ring of resolution in her voice. <q>I was once indebted to him for
assistance in money for more than three thousand, and I took it, although
I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in a
position to repay my debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch
began his cross-examination.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your
acquaintance?</q> Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way,
instantly scenting something favorable. I must mention in parenthesis
that, though Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg
partly at the instance of Katerina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing
<pb n='771'/><anchor id='Pg771'/>
about the episode of the four thousand roubles given her by Mitya,
and of her <q>bowing to the ground to him.</q> She concealed this
from him and said nothing about it, and that was strange. It may
be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know till the
very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the
court, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.
</p>

<p>
No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her
story. She told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told
Alyosha, and her bowing to the ground, and her reason. She told
about her father and her going to Mitya, and did not in one word,
in a single hint, suggest that Mitya had himself, through her sister,
proposed they should <q>send him Katerina Ivanovna</q> to fetch the
money. She generously concealed that and was not ashamed to make
it appear as though she had of her own impulse run to the young
officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money. It
was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I
listened. The court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was
something unexampled. Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously
proud girl as she was, such an extremely frank avowal,
such sacrifice, such self-immolation, seemed incredible. And for
what, for whom? To save the man who had deceived and insulted
her and to help, in however small a degree, in saving him, by creating
a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, the figure of the
young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent girl,
handed her his last four thousand roubles&mdash;all he had in the world&mdash;was
thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ...
I had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might
come of it later (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all
over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was
perhaps not quite complete&mdash;that is, in the statement that the officer
had let the young lady depart <q>with nothing but a respectful bow.</q>
It was hinted that something was here omitted.
</p>

<p>
<q>And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole
story,</q> the most highly respected of our ladies maintained, <q>even
then it's very doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl
to behave in that way, even for the sake of saving her father.</q>
</p>

<p>
And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid
sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like
<pb n='772'/><anchor id='Pg772'/>
that? She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to
tell everything. Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the
truth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all
were deeply impressed by it. As for the judges and the lawyers,
they listened in reverent, almost shame-faced silence to Katerina
Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture upon even one question
on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her. Oh, he was
almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to
give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the
same man to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three
thousand&mdash;the idea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt
that now the charge of theft, at least, was as good as disproved.
<q>The case</q> was thrown into quite a different light. There was a
wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for him.... I was told that
once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her evidence, he
jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid his face in his
hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in a sobbing
voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Katya, why have you ruined me?</q> and his sobs were audible
all over the court. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried
again:
</p>

<p>
<q>Now I am condemned!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his
arms across his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and
sat down in her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast
down. Those who were sitting near her declared that for a long
time she shivered all over as though in a fever. Grushenka was
called.
</p>

<p>
I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the
final cause of Mitya's ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one&mdash;all
the lawyers said the same afterwards&mdash;that if the episode had
not occurred, the prisoner would at least have been recommended
to mercy. But of that later. A few words first about Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black
shawl on her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her
smooth, noiseless tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in
women of full figure. She looked steadily at the President, turning
her eyes neither to the right nor to the left. To my thinking she
<pb n='773'/><anchor id='Pg773'/>
looked very handsome at that moment, and not at all pale, as the
ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too, that she had a concentrated
and spiteful expression. I believe that she was simply
irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive
eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could not
stand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry
and eager to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There
was an element of timidity, too, of course, and inward shame at
her own timidity, so it was not strange that her tone kept changing.
At one moment it was angry, contemptuous and rough, and at
another there was a sincere note of self-condemnation. Sometimes
she spoke as though she were taking a desperate plunge; as though
she felt, <q>I don't care what happens, I'll say it....</q> Apropos of
her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarked curtly,
<q>That's all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pester me?</q>
But a minute later she added, <q>It was all my fault. I was laughing
at them both&mdash;at the old man and at him, too&mdash;and I brought both
of them to this. It was all on account of me it happened.</q>
</p>

<p>
Samsonov's name came up somehow. <q>That's nobody's business,</q>
she snapped at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. <q>He
was my benefactor; he took me when I hadn't a shoe to my foot,
when my family had turned me out.</q> The President reminded her,
though very politely, that she must answer the questions directly,
without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka crimsoned and
her eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
The envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only
heard from <q>that wicked wretch</q> that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an
envelope with notes for three thousand in it. <q>But that was all
foolishness. I was only laughing. I wouldn't have gone to him for
anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To whom are you referring as <q>that wicked wretch</q>?</q> inquired
the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged
himself last night.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such
a definite accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds
for it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him.
<pb n='774'/><anchor id='Pg774'/>
The woman who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause
of it all, let me tell you,</q> Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering
with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her voice.
</p>

<p>
She was again asked to whom she was referring.
</p>

<p>
<q>The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me,
offered me chocolate, tried to fascinate me. There's not much true
shame about her, I can tell you that....</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to
moderate her language. But the jealous woman's heart was burning,
and she did not care what she did.
</p>

<p>
<q>When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,</q> the prosecutor
asked, <q>every one saw and heard you run out of the next room and
cry out: <q>It's all my fault. We'll go to Siberia together!</q> So you
already believed him to have murdered his father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't remember what I felt at the time,</q> answered Grushenka.
<q>Every one was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt
that it was my fault, that it was on my account he had murdered
him. But when he said he wasn't guilty, I believed him at once, and
I believe him now and always shall believe him. He is not the man
to tell a lie.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that
among other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five
roubles <q>you paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov
to see you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There was nothing strange about his taking the money,</q> sneered
Grushenka, with angry contempt. <q>He was always coming to me
for money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me,
chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my help.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?</q> Fetyukovitch
asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother's sister.
But he's always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so
dreadfully ashamed of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the
town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told
