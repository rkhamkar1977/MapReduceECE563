discussed that, too. But though Smerdyakov always talked
of that with great excitement, it was impossible to discover what
he desired to come of it. There was, in fact, something surprising
in the illogicality and incoherence of some of his desires, accidentally
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
betrayed and always vaguely expressed. Smerdyakov was always
inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously premeditated questions,
but what his object was he did not explain, and usually at the
most important moment he would break off and relapse into silence
or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most
and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity
which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly.
Not that he forgot himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always
spoke very respectfully, yet he had obviously begun to consider&mdash;goodness
knows why!&mdash;that there was some sort of understanding
between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always spoke in a tone
that suggested that those two had some kind of compact, some secret
between them, that had at some time been expressed on both sides,
only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around
them. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of
his growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the
root of it.
</p>

<p>
With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at
the gate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov
rose from the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew
instantly that he wanted particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked
at him and stopped, and the fact that he did stop, instead of passing
by, as he meant to the minute before, drove him to fury. With
anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov's emasculate, sickly
face, with the little curls combed forward on his forehead. His
left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, <q>Where are you going?
You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have something
to say to each other.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan shook. <q>Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with
you?</q> was on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment
he heard himself say, <q>Is my father still asleep, or has he
waked?</q>
</p>

<p>
He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise,
and at once, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For
an instant he felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards.
Smerdyakov stood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking
at him with assurance and almost severity.
</p>

<p>
<q>His honor is still asleep,</q> he articulated deliberately (<q>You were
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
the first to speak, not I,</q> he seemed to say). <q>I am surprised at you,
sir,</q> he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his
right foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you surprised at me?</q> Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly,
doing his utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing,
with disgust, that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not,
on any account, have gone away without satisfying it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?</q> Smerdyakov suddenly
raised his eyes and smiled familiarly. <q>Why I smile you must
understand of yourself, if you are a clever man,</q> his screwed-up
left eye seemed to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should I go to Tchermashnya?</q> Ivan asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was silent again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,</q> he said at
last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his answer.
<q>I put you off with a secondary reason,</q> he seemed to suggest,
<q>simply to say something.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn you! Speak out what you want!</q> Ivan cried angrily
at last, passing from meekness to violence.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up,
but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Substantially nothing&mdash;but just by way of conversation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute.
Ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov
stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether
he would be angry or not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last
he moved to get up. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how
to help myself,</q> he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last
word he sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little
children,</q> Smerdyakov went on. <q>I am speaking of your parent
and your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch
will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute, <q>Has she
come? Why hasn't she come?</q> and so on up till midnight and even
after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn't come (for
very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he will be at me
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
again to-morrow morning, <q>Why hasn't she come? When will she
come?</q>&mdash;as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it's
no better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother
will appear with his gun in his hands: <q>Look out, you rogue, you
soup-maker. If you miss her and don't let me know she's been&mdash;I'll
kill you before any one.</q> When the night's over, in the morning,
he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death. <q>Why
hasn't she come? Will she come soon?</q> And he, too, thinks me to
blame because his lady hasn't come. And every day and every
hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall
kill myself in a fright. I can't depend upon them, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for
Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q> said Ivan irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven't meddled
at all, if you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet
from the very beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on
me to be his servant. He has had only one thing to say since: <q>I'll
kill you, you scoundrel, if you miss her,</q> I feel certain, sir, that I
shall have a long fit to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>a long fit</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A long fit, lasting a long time&mdash;several hours, or perhaps a day
or two. Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret
that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for
three days I couldn't come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch
sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head
and tried another remedy, too.... I might have died.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming.
What makes you say you will have one to-morrow?</q> Ivan inquired,
with a peculiar, irritable curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just so. You can't tell beforehand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Besides, you fell from the garret then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret
again to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps.
I have to go into the cellar every day, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took a long look at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand
you,</q> he said softly, but with a sort of menace. <q>Do you mean to
pretend to be ill to-morrow for three days, eh?</q>
</p>

<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>

<p>
Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing
with the toe of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one
forward, and, grinning, articulated:
</p>

<p>
<q>If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit&mdash;and
it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them&mdash;I
should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from
death. For even if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father
while I am ill, his honor can't blame a sick man for not telling him.
He'd be ashamed to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hang it all!</q> Ivan cried, his face working with anger, <q>why
are you always in such a funk for your life? All my brother
Dmitri's threats are only hasty words and mean nothing. He won't
kill you; it's not you he'll kill!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He'd kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that,
I am afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does
something crazy to his father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should you be taken for an accomplice?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the
signals as a great secret.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more
plainly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm bound to admit the fact,</q> Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic
composure, <q>that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in
this business. As you know yourself (if only you do know it) he
has for several days past locked himself in as soon as night or even
evening comes on. Of late you've been going upstairs to your room
early every evening, and yesterday you did not come down at all,
and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he has begun to lock
himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the
door he won't open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory
Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his
room now. That's the arrangement he made himself ever since this
to-do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his
orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don't get to sleep till midnight,
but am on the watch, getting up and walking about the yard,
waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come. For the last few
days he's been perfectly frantic expecting her. What he argues is,
she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he calls him),
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
<q>and so,</q> says he, <q>she'll come the back-way, late at night, to me.
You look out for her,</q> says he, <q>till midnight and later; and if she
does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window
from the garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then
three times more quickly, then,</q> says he, <q>I shall understand at once
that she has come, and will open the door to you quietly.</q> Another
signal he gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At first,
two knocks, and then, after an interval, another much louder.
Then he will understand that something has happened suddenly and
that I must see him, and he will open to me so that I can go and
speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't come
herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might
come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully
afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna
had come and were locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch
were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should be bound
to let him know at once, knocking three times. So that the first
signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, while
the second signal of three knocks means <q>something important to tell
you.</q> His honor has shown me them several times and explained
them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of these signals
but myself and his honor, so he'd open the door without the slightest
hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of calling
out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch
too, now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you
tell him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it
back from him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day,
<q>You are deceiving me, you are hiding something from me! I'll
break both your legs for you.</q> So I told him those secret signals that
he might see my slavish devotion, and might be satisfied that I was
not deceiving him, but was telling him all I could.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you think that he'll make use of those signals and try to get
in, don't let him in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him
coming in then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate
he is?</q>
</p>

<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>

<p>
<q>Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit,
confound you? Are you laughing at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor
with this fear on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a
presentiment. Fright alone will bring it on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch.
Let Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the
signals without orders from my master. And as for Grigory
Vassilyevitch hearing him and not admitting him, he has been ill
ever since yesterday, and Marfa Ignatyevna intends to give him
medicine to-morrow. They've just arranged it. It's a very strange
remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a preparation and
always keeps it. It's a strong thing made from some herb. She
has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch
three times a year when his lumbago's so bad he is almost paralyzed
by it. Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his
whole back for half an hour till it's quite red and swollen, and what's
left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but
not quite all, for on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and
drinks it herself. And as they never take strong drink, I assure you
they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a very long time.
And when Grigory Vassilyevitch wakes up he is perfectly well after
it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a headache from it. So, if
Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention to-morrow, they won't
hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They'll be asleep.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though
it were planned. You'll have a fit and they'll both be unconscious,</q>
cried Ivan. <q>But aren't you trying to arrange it so?</q> broke from
him suddenly, and he frowned threateningly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on
Dmitri Fyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything,
he'll do it; but if not, I shan't be thrusting him upon his
father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you
say yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won't come at all?</q> Ivan
went on, turning white with anger. <q>You say that yourself, and all
the while I've been here, I've felt sure it was all the old man's fancy,
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
and the creature won't come to him. Why should Dmitri break in
on him if she doesn't come? Speak, I want to know what you are
thinking!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know yourself why he'll come. What's the use of what I
think? His honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious
on account of my illness perhaps, and he'll dash in, as he did
yesterday through impatience to search the rooms, to see whether
she hasn't escaped him on the sly. He is perfectly well aware,
too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big envelope with three thousand
roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed with three seals. On
it is written in his own hand, <q>To my angel Grushenka, if she will
come,</q> to which he added three days later, <q>for my little chicken.</q>
There's no knowing what that might do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q> cried Ivan, almost beside himself. <q>Dmitri won't
come to steal money and kill my father to do it. He might have
killed him yesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic,
savage fool he is, but he won't steal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is in very great need of money now&mdash;the greatest need, Ivan
Fyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he is,</q> Smerdyakov
explained, with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. <q>He
looks on that three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself.
<q>My father still owes me just three thousand,</q> he said. And
besides that, consider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something else
perfectly true. It's as good as certain, so to say, that Agrafena
Alexandrovna will force him, if only she cares to, to marry her&mdash;the
master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch&mdash;if only she cares to,
and of course she may care to. All I've said is that she won't come,
but maybe she's looking for more than that&mdash;I mean to be mistress
here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing
with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all
a stupid thing to do. And she's got plenty of sense. She wouldn't
marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into
consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri
Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
would have anything after the master's death, not a rouble, for
Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply to get hold of the
whole, all the money there is. But if your father were to die now,
there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for Dmitri Fyodorovitch
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
whom he hates so, for he's made no will.... Dmitri Fyodorovitch
knows all that very well.</q>
</p>

<p>
A sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He suddenly flushed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then why on earth,</q> he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, <q>do
you advise me to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by
that? If I go away, you see what will happen here.</q> Ivan drew
his breath with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely so,</q> said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching
Ivan intently, however.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>precisely so</q>?</q> Ivan questioned him,
with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place
I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a
position,</q> answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking
at Ivan's flashing eyes. They were both silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more ... an awful
scoundrel, too.</q> Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about
to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to
Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden
paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute,
would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway,
noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the
moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned
in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know&mdash;early
to-morrow morning. That's all!</q> he suddenly said aloud
angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to
say this then to Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's the best thing you can do,</q> he responded, as though he
had expected to hear it; <q>except that you can always be telegraphed
for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov.
But a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and
carelessness had completely disappeared. His face expressed attention
and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Haven't you something more to say&mdash;something to add?</q> could
be read in the intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.
</p>

<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>

<p>
<q>And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too&mdash;in case
anything happened?</q> Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown
reason raising his voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,</q> Smerdyakov
muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but
gazing intently into Ivan's eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to
save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out
of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely so ...</q> muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice.
He looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to
draw back. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and
went through the gate still laughing. Any one who had seen his
face at that moment would have known that he was not laughing
from lightness of heart, and he could not have explained himself
what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked as
though in a nervous frenzy.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. <q>It's Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man</q></head>

<p>
And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor
Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he went in, he
shouted to him, waving his hands, <q>I am going upstairs to my room,
not in to you. Good-by!</q> and passed by, trying not even to look
at his father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at
that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a
surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently
wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in
the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he
stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going
upstairs, till he passed out of sight.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with him?</q> he promptly asked Smerdyakov,
who had followed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Angry about something. Who can tell?</q> the valet muttered
evasively.
</p>

<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>

<p>
<q>Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar,
and get along with you. Look sharp! No news?</q>
</p>

<p>
Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just
complained of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these
questions we will omit. Half an hour later the house was locked,
and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms in
excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks agreed
upon. Now and then he peered out into the darkness, seeing nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat
up late that night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an account
of his thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that
soul&mdash;its turn will come. And even if one tried, it would be very
hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts in his
brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense excitement.
He felt himself that he had lost his bearings. He was fretted, too,
by all sorts of strange and almost surprising desires; for instance,
after midnight he suddenly had an intense irresistible inclination to
go down, open the door, go to the lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But
if he had been asked why, he could not have given any exact reason,
except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one who had insulted him
more gravely than any one in the world. On the other hand, he was
more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating
terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical
powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred
was rankling in his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on
some one. He even hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had
just had with him. At moments he hated himself intensely. Of
Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot to think, and wondered greatly
at this afterwards, especially as he remembered perfectly that when
he had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he would
go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his
heart, <q>That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy
to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with
peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and
had stealthily, as though he were afraid of being watched, opened the
door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>
stirring down below, had listened a long while&mdash;some five minutes&mdash;with
a sort of strange curiosity, holding his breath while his heart
throbbed. And why he had done all this, why he was listening, he
could not have said. That <q>action</q> all his life afterwards he called
<q>infamous,</q> and at the bottom of his heart, he thought of it as the
basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he felt no
hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious to know
how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing
now. He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of
the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room, listening,
listening&mdash;for some one to knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs
twice to listen like this.
</p>

<p>
About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor
Pavlovitch had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved
to fall asleep at once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did
fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked
early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight. Opening his
eyes, he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous. He
jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then dragged out his trunk
and began packing immediately. His linen had come back from
the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at the
thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his
departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before
(to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was
leaving next day, yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure
when he went to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his
first act in the morning would be to pack his trunk. At last his
trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine o'clock when Marfa
Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, <q>Where will your
honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?</q> He looked
almost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and
gestures, something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father
affably, and even inquiring specially after his health, though he did
not wait to hear his answer to the end, he announced that he was
starting off in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged
him to send for the horses. His father heard this announcement
with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an unmannerly way to show
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>
regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew into a great
flutter at the recollection of some important business of his own.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never
mind; we'll manage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear
boy. Go to Tchermashnya on the way. It's only to turn to the
left from the station at Volovya, only another twelve versts and
you come to Tchermashnya.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the train
starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night. I can only just catch
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off
to Tchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humor your
father! If I hadn't had something to keep me here, I would have
run over myself long ago, for I've some business there in a hurry.
But here I ... it's not the time for me to go now.... You see,
I've two pieces of copse land there. The Maslovs, an old merchant
and his son, will give eight thousand for the timber. But last year
I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve. There's no
getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have it all their
own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here dare
bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday
that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up.
What makes him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is
not afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand
for the copse. Do you hear? But he'll only be here, the priest
writes, for a week altogether, so you must go at once and make a
bargain with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you write to the priest; he'll make the bargain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He can't do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect
treasure, I'd give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without
a receipt; but he has no eye for business, he is a perfect child,
a crow could deceive him. And yet he is a learned man, would you
believe it? This Gorstkin looks like a peasant, he wears a blue
kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That's the common complaint.
He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he
is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife was dead
and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>
was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is
alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you
have to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when
he says he wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the
signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin. I've done business
with him a long time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has
a nasty, thin, red beard. If his beard shakes when he talks and he
gets cross, it's all right, he is saying what he means, he wants to
do business. But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins&mdash;he
is trying to cheat you. Don't watch his eyes, you won't find
out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a rogue&mdash;but watch his
beard! I'll give you a note and you show it to him. He's called
Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy<note place='foot'>i.e.
setter dog.</note>; but don't call him so,
he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and
see it's all right, write here at once. You need only write: <q>He's not
lying.</q> Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock
off, but not more. Just think! there's a difference between eight
thousand and eleven thousand. It's as good as picking up three
thousand; it's not so easy to find a purchaser, and I'm in desperate
need of money. Only let me know it's serious, and I'll run over and
fix it up. I'll snatch the time somehow. But what's the good of my
galloping over, if it's all a notion of the priest's? Come, will you
go?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I can't spare the time. You must excuse me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, you might oblige your father. I shan't forget it. You've
no heart, any of you&mdash;that's what it is? What's a day or two to
you? Where are you going now&mdash;to Venice? Your Venice will
keep another two days. I would have sent Alyosha, but what use
is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you just because you are a
clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You know nothing
about timber, but you've got an eye. All that is wanted is to
see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard&mdash;if
his beard shakes you know he is in earnest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself,
then?</q> cried Ivan, with a malignant smile.
</p>

<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy,
but he caught the smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you'll go, you'll go? I'll scribble the note for you at
once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether I shall go. I don't know. I'll decide on
the way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you
settle the matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he'll send
it on to me at once. And I won't delay you more than that. You
can go to Venice. The priest will give you horses back to Volovya
station.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent
for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When
Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but
to-day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he
did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and
seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this
particularly. <q>He must be bored with me,</q> he thought. Only
when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began
to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to
hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it
at once, and instantly pulled himself up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!</q> he repeated from the
steps. <q>You'll come again some time or other? Mind you do come.
I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan got into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Ivan! Don't be too hard on me!</q> the father called
for the last time.
</p>

<p>
The whole household came out to take leave&mdash;Smerdyakov, Marfa
and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated
himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,</q> broke suddenly
from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of
themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He
remembered it long after.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a true saying then, that <q>it's always worth while speaking to
a clever man,</q></q> answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly
at Ivan.
</p>

<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>

<p>
The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan's soul, but
he looked eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees,
at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all
of a sudden he felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver,
and he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him;
but a minute later he realized that he was not catching anything,
and that he had not really even taken in the peasant's answer. He
was silent, and it was pleasant even so. The air was fresh, pure and
cool, the sky bright. The images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna
floated into his mind. But he softly smiled, blew softly on the
friendly phantoms, and they flew away. <q>There's plenty of time
for them,</q> he thought. They reached the station quickly, changed
horses, and galloped to Volovya. <q>Why is it worth while speaking
to a clever man? What did he mean by that?</q> The thought
seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing. <q>And why did I tell
him I was going to Tchermashnya?</q> They reached Volovya station.
Ivan got out of the carriage, and the drivers stood round him bargaining
over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya. He
told them to harness the horses. He went into the station house,
looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife, and suddenly went
back to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway
by seven, brothers?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure. Mitri here will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father's, to Fyodor
Pavlovitch Karamazov, and tell him I haven't gone to Tchermashnya.
Can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And here's something for you, for I dare say he won't give you
anything,</q> said Ivan, laughing gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You may depend on it he won't.</q> Mitya laughed too. <q>Thank
you, sir. I'll be sure to do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow
<q>Away with the past. I've done with the old world for ever, and
may I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>
and no looking back!</q> But instead of delight his soul was filled
with such gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish, as he had
never known in his life before. He was thinking all the night.
The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching
Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a scoundrel,</q> he whispered to himself.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son
off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking
brandy. But suddenly something happened which was very
annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house, and completely
upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's equanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to
the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps.
Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the yard and heard him in
time. She did not see the fall, but heard his scream&mdash;the strange,
peculiar scream, long familiar to her&mdash;the scream of the epileptic
falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit had come on
him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he must have
fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had
caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them.
They found him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions
and foaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he
must have broken something&mdash;an arm or a leg&mdash;and hurt himself,
but <q>God had preserved him,</q> as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it&mdash;nothing
of the kind had happened. But it was difficult to get him
out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to help and managed it
somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole
ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man
did not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but
then began again, and every one concluded that the same thing
would happen, as had happened a year before, when he accidentally
fell from the garret. They remembered that ice had been put on
his head then. There was still ice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna
had some brought up. In the evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for
Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at once. He was a most estimable
old man, and the most careful and conscientious doctor in the
province. After careful examination, he concluded that the fit
was a very violent one and might have serious consequences; that
meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it, but that by
<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>
to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he
would venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the
lodge, to a room next to Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's.
</p>

<p>
Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put
up with that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the
soup, compared with Smerdyakov's, was <q>no better than dish-water,</q>
and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it.
To her master's bitter, though deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna
replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with, and
that she had never been trained as a cook. In the evening there
was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he was informed
that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days, was
completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his
tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house.
He was in terrible excitement and suspense. That evening he
reckoned on Grushenka's coming almost as a certainty. He had received
from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance <q>that she had
promised to come without fail.</q> The incorrigible old man's heart
throbbed with excitement; he paced up and down his empty rooms
listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch
for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov
had informed him two days before that he had told her where
and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not
be a second in the passage, for fear&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;that she
should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much
to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous
hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come!

<head>Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors</head>

<p>
When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into
his elder's cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a
sick man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to
find him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and
exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by
visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation. But he
had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha's
arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier, waiting
for him to wake, having received a most confident assurance from
Father Païssy that <q>the teacher would get up, and as he had himself
promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his
heart.</q> This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder
Father Païssy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him unconscious,
if he had seen him breathe his last, and yet had his promise
that he would rise up and say good-by to him, he would not have
believed perhaps even in death, but would still have expected the
dead man to recover and fulfill his promise. In the morning as he
lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told him positively: <q>I shall
not die without the delight of another conversation with you, beloved
of my heart. I shall look once more on your dear face and
pour out my heart to you once again.</q> The monks, who had
gathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima,
had all been his devoted friends for many years. There were four
of them: Father Iosif and Father Païssy, Father Mihaïl, the warden
of the hermitage, a man not very old and far from being learned.
He was of humble origin, of strong will and steadfast faith, of
austere appearance, but of deep tenderness, though he obviously concealed
it as though he were almost ashamed of it. The fourth,
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>
Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little monk of the poorest
peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and very quiet, scarcely
speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble, and
looked as though he had been frightened by something great and
awful beyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a
great affection for this timorous man, and always treated him with
marked respect, though perhaps there was no one he had known to
whom he had said less, in spite of the fact that he had spent years
wandering about holy Russia with him. That was very long ago,
forty years before, when Father Zossima first began his life as a monk
in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, and when, shortly after,
he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to collect alms
for their poor monastery.
</p>

<p>
The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned
before, was very small, so that there was scarcely room for the four
of them (in addition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit
round Father Zossima on chairs brought from the sitting-room. It
was already beginning to get dark, the room was lighted up by the
lamps and the candles before the ikons.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father
Zossima smiled at him joyfully and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too.
I knew you would come.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground
and wept. Something surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering,
he wanted to sob.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, don't weep over me yet,</q> Father Zossima smiled, laying
his right hand on his head. <q>You see I am sitting up talking; maybe
I shall live another twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from
Vishegorye, with her little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday.
God bless the mother and the little girl Lizaveta,</q> he crossed himself.
<q>Porfiry, did you take her offering where I told you?</q>
</p>

<p>
He meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the
good-humored woman to be given <q>to some one poorer than me.</q>
Such offerings, always of money gained by personal toil, are made by
way of penance voluntarily undertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry
the evening before to a widow, whose house had been burnt down
lately, and who after the fire had gone with her children begging
<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>
alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had given the money, as he
had been instructed, <q>from an unknown benefactress.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Get up, my dear boy,</q> the elder went on to Alyosha. <q>Let me
look at you. Have you been home and seen your brother?</q> It
seemed strange to Alyosha that he asked so confidently and precisely,
about one of his brothers only&mdash;but which one? Then perhaps he
had sent him out both yesterday and to-day for the sake of that
brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have seen one of my brothers,</q> answered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day,</q> said
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste,
leave everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time
to prevent something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the
great suffering in store for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words
were strange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday,
exchanged glances with Father Païssy. Alyosha could not resist
asking:
</p>

<p>
<q>Father and teacher,</q> he began with extreme emotion, <q>your
words are too obscure.... What is this suffering in store for
him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as
though his whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look
came into his eyes&mdash;so that I was instantly horror-stricken at what
that man is preparing for himself. Once or twice in my life I've
seen such a look in a man's face ... reflecting as it were his future
fate, and that fate, alas, came to pass. I sent you to him, Alexey,
for I thought your brotherly face would help him. But everything
and all our fates are from the Lord. <q>Except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth
forth much fruit.</q> Remember that. You, Alexey, I've many times
silently blessed for your face, know that,</q> added the elder with a
gentle smile. <q>This is what I think of you, you will go forth from
these walls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have
many enemies, but even your foes will love you. Life will bring
you many misfortunes, but you will find your happiness in them,
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>
and will bless life and will make others bless it&mdash;which is what
matters most. Well, that is your character. Fathers and teachers,</q>
he addressed his friends with a tender smile, <q>I have never till to-day
told even him why the face of this youth is so dear to me. Now I
will tell you. His face has been as it were a remembrance and a
prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a child I had
an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And later on
in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that
brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For
had he not come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at
least, have become a monk and entered on this precious path. He
appeared first to me in my childhood, and here, at the end of my
pilgrimage, he seems to have come to me over again. It is marvelous,
fathers and teachers, that Alexey, who has some, though not
a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like him spiritually, that
many times I have taken him for that young man, my brother,
mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as a
reminder and an inspiration. So that I positively wondered at so
strange a dream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?</q> he turned to
the novice who waited on him. <q>Many times I've seen in your face
as it were a look of mortification that I love Alexey more than you.
Now you know why that was so, but I love you too, know that, and
many times I grieved at your mortification. I should like to tell
you, dear friends, of that youth, my brother, for there has been no
presence in my life more precious, more significant and touching.
My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at my whole life at this
moment as though living through it again.</q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
Here I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima
with the friends who visited him on the last day of his life has been
partly preserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote
it down from memory, some time after his elder's death. But
whether this was only the conversation that took place then, or
whether he added to it his notes of parts of former conversations
with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his account, Father
Zossima's talk goes on without interruption, as though he told his
life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt,
from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was
<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>
general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much,
yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides,
Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative,
for he was sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed
him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though he did not fall
asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once or twice the
conversation was interrupted by Father Païssy's reading the Gospel.
It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed that he would
die that night, for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in
the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept
him up through this long conversation. It was like a last effort of
love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little time, however,
for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that later.
I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the
account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be
shorter and not so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat,
Alyosha took a great deal from previous conversations and added
them to it.

Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in
the north, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth,
but of no great consequence or position. He died when I was only
two years old, and I don't remember him at all. He left my mother
a small house built of wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient
to keep her and her children in comfort. There were two of us,
my elder brother Markel and I. He was eight years older than I
was, of hasty irritable temperament, but kind-hearted and never
ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at home with me,
his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did not get
on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so my
mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was
seventeen, he made friends with a political exile who had been
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>
banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led a
solitary existence there. He was a good scholar who had gained
distinction in philosophy in the university. Something made him
take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see him. The
young man would spend whole evenings with him during that
winter, till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his
post again at his own request, as he had powerful friends.
</p>

<p>
It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was
rude and laughed at it. <q>That's all silly twaddle, and there is no
God,</q> he said, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too.
For though I was only nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words.
We had four servants, all serfs. I remember my mother selling one
of the four, the cook Afimya, who was lame and elderly, for sixty
paper roubles, and hiring a free servant to take her place.
</p>

<p>
In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and
had a tendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin
and delicate-looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose
he caught cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to
my mother that it was galloping consumption, that he would not
live through the spring. My mother began weeping, and, careful
not to alarm my brother, she entreated him to go to church, to confess
and take the sacrament, as he was still able to move about. This
made him angry, and he said something profane about the church.
He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he was seriously
ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him to
confess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a
long time past, that he was far from well, and had a year before
coolly observed at dinner to our mother and me, <q>My life won't be
long among you, I may not live another year,</q> which seemed now
like a prophecy.
</p>

<p>
Three days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday
morning my brother began going to church. <q>I am doing this
simply for your sake, mother, to please and comfort you,</q> he said.
My mother wept with joy and grief. <q>His end must be near,</q> she
thought, <q>if there's such a change in him.</q> But he was not able to
go to church long, he took to his bed, so he had to confess and take
the sacrament at home.
</p>

<p>
It was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of
<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>
fragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly,
but in the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair.
That's how I remember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his
face bright and joyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change
passed over him, his spirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would
come in and say, <q>Let me light the lamp before the holy image, my
dear.</q> And once he would not have allowed it and would have
blown it out.
</p>

<p>
<q>Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you
doing it. You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying
when I rejoice seeing you. So we are praying to the same God.</q>
</p>

<p>
Those words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her
room and weep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes
and looked cheerful. <q>Mother, don't weep, darling,</q> he would say,
<q>I've long to live yet, long to rejoice with you, and life is glad and
joyful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish
at night, coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't cry, mother,</q> he would answer, <q>life is paradise, and we
are all in paradise, but we won't see it, if we would, we should
have heaven on earth the next day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively;
we were all touched and wept. Friends came to see us.
<q>Dear ones,</q> he would say to them, <q>what have I done that you
should love me so, how can you love any one like me, and how was
it I did not know, I did not appreciate it before?</q>
</p>

<p>
When the servants came in to him he would say continually,
<q>Dear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve
to be waited on? If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait
on you, for all men should wait on one another.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mother shook her head as she listened. <q>My darling, it's your illness
makes you talk like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, darling,</q> he would say, <q>there must be servants and
masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as
they are to me. And another thing, mother, every one of us has
sinned against all men, and I more than any.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. <q>Why,
how could you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>
and murderers have done that, but what sin have you committed
yet, that you hold yourself more guilty than all?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, little heart of mine,</q> he said (he had begun using such
strange caressing words at that time), <q>little heart of mine, my
joy, believe me, every one is really responsible to all men for all men
and for everything. I don't know how to explain it to you, but I
feel it is so, painfully even. And how is it we went on then living,
getting angry and not knowing?</q>
</p>

<p>
So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous
and full of love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt,
came:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?</q> he would ask,
joking.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll live many days yet,</q> the doctor would answer, <q>and
months and years too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Months and years!</q> he would exclaim. <q>Why reckon the days?
One day is enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones,
why do we quarrel, try to outshine each other and keep grudges
against each other? Let's go straight into the garden, walk and
play there, love, appreciate, and kiss each other, and glorify life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your son cannot last long,</q> the doctor told my mother, as she
accompanied him to the door. <q>The disease is affecting his brain.</q>
</p>

<p>
The windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our
garden was a shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into
bud. The first birds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping
and singing at the windows. And looking at them and admiring
them, he began suddenly begging their forgiveness too: <q>Birds
of heaven, happy birds, forgive me, for I have sinned against you
too.</q> None of us could understand that at the time, but he shed
tears of joy. <q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>there was such a glory of God all
about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in shame and dishonored
it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You take too many sins on yourself,</q> mother used to say,
weeping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, darling, it's for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though
I can't explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for
I don't know how to love them enough. If I have sinned against
every one, yet all forgive me, too, and that's heaven. Am I not in
heaven now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>

<p>
And there was a great deal more I don't remember. I remember
I went once into his room when there was no one else there. It was
a bright evening, the sun was setting, and the whole room was
lighted up. He beckoned me, and I went up to him. He put his
hands on my shoulders and looked into my face tenderly, lovingly;
he said nothing for a minute, only looked at me like that.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> he said, <q>run and play now, enjoy life for me too.</q>
</p>

<p>
I went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life
afterwards I remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy
life for him too. There were many other marvelous and beautiful
sayings of his, though we did not understand them at the time.
He died the third week after Easter. He was fully conscious
though he could not talk; up to his last hour he did not change.
He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us,
beckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in the town about
his death. I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much
so, though I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then,
a child, but a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained
in my heart, ready to rise up and respond when the time
came. So indeed it happened.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her
to send me to Petersburg as other parents did. <q>You have only one
son now,</q> they said, <q>and have a fair income, and you will be
depriving him perhaps of a brilliant career if you keep him here.</q>
They suggested I should be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps,
that I might afterwards enter the Imperial Guard. My mother
hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her only child,
but she made up her mind to it at last, though not without many
tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought me
to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw
her again. For she too died three years afterwards. She spent those
three years mourning and grieving for both of us.
</p>

<p>
From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but
precious memories, for there are no memories more precious than
those of early childhood in one's first home. And that is almost
always so if there is any love and harmony in the family at all.
<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>
Indeed, precious memories may remain even of a bad home, if only
the heart knows how to find what is precious. With my memories
of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible, which, child as I
was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a book of Scripture
history then with excellent pictures, called <hi rend='italic'>A Hundred and Four
Stories from the Old and New Testament</hi>, and I learned to read
from it. I have it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious
relic of the past. But even before I learned to read, I remember
first being moved to devotional feeling at eight years old. My
mother took me alone to mass (I don't remember where my brother
was at the time) on the Monday before Easter. It was a fine day,
and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now, how the incense
rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and, overhead in
the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed
in at the little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for the first
time in my life I consciously received the seed of God's word in my
heart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a
big book, so large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry
it. He laid it on the reading desk, opened it, and began reading,
and suddenly for the first time I understood something read in the
church of God. In the land of Uz, there lived a man, righteous
and God-fearing, and he had great wealth, so many camels, so many
sheep and asses, and his children feasted, and he loved them very
much and prayed for them. <q>It may be that my sons have sinned
in their feasting.</q> Now the devil came before the Lord together
with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone up and
down the earth and under the earth. <q>And hast thou considered
my servant Job?</q> God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil,
pointing to his great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at
God's words. <q>Give him over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy
servant will murmur against Thee and curse Thy name.</q> And
God gave up the just man He loved so, to the devil. And the devil
smote his children and his cattle and scattered his wealth, all of a
sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his mantle
and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, <q>Naked came I
out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return into the earth;
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name
of the Lord for ever and ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood
rises up again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with
the breast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and
wonder and gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination,
and Satan, who talked like that with God, and God who gave
His servant up to destruction, and His servant crying out: <q>Blessed
be Thy name although Thou dost punish me,</q> and then the soft
and sweet singing in the church: <q>Let my prayer rise up before
Thee,</q> and again incense from the priest's censer and the kneeling
and the prayer. Ever since then&mdash;only yesterday I took it up&mdash;I've
never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how
much that is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it!
Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame, proud words,
<q>How could God give up the most loved of His saints for the diversion
of the devil, take from him his children, smite him with sore
boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a pot-sherd&mdash;and
for no object except to boast to the devil! <q>See what
My saint can suffer for My sake.</q></q> But the greatness of it lies just
in the fact that it is a mystery&mdash;that the passing earthly show
and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of
the earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator,
just as on the first days of creation He ended each day with praise:
<q>That is good that I have created,</q> looks upon Job and again praises
His creation. And Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but
all His creation for generations and generations, and for ever and
ever, since for that he was ordained. Good heavens, what a book
it is, and what lessons there are in it! What a book the Bible is,
what a miracle, what strength is given with it to man! It is like a
mold cast of the world and man and human nature, everything is
there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And what mysteries
are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him
wealth again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and
loves them. But how could he love those new ones when those
first children are no more, when he has lost them? Remembering
them, how could he be fully happy with those new ones, however
dear the new ones might be? But he could, he could. It's the great
<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/>
mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet,
tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous
blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before,
my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its
long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come
with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life&mdash;and
over all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving!
My life is ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I
feel how my earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown,
that approaching life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering
with rapture, my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.
</p>

<p>
Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late
one may hear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village
priests, are complaining on all sides of their miserable income
and their humiliating lot. They plainly state, even in print&mdash;I've
read it myself&mdash;that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the
people because of the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans
and heretics come and lead the flock astray, they let them lead
them astray because they have so little to live upon. May the
Lord increase the sustenance that is so precious to them, for their
complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say, if any one is to blame
in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he may be short of time,
he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while with work
and services, but still it's not all the time, even he has an hour a
week to remember God. And he does not work the whole year
round. Let him gather round him once a week, some hour in the
evening, if only the children at first&mdash;the fathers will hear of it and
they too will begin to come. There's no need to build halls for this,
let him take them into his own cottage. They won't spoil his cottage,
they would only be there one hour. Let him open that book
and begin reading it without grand words or superciliousness, without
condescension to them, but gently and kindly, being glad that
he is reading to them and that they are listening with attention,
loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to explain
words that are not understood by the peasants. Don't be anxious,
they will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand
all! Let him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac
and Rebecca, of how Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the
<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>
Lord in his dream and said, <q>This place is holy</q>&mdash;and he will impress
the devout mind of the peasant. Let him read, especially to the
children, how the brothers sold Joseph, the tender boy, the dreamer
and prophet, into bondage, and told their father that a wild beast
had devoured him, and showed him his blood-stained clothes. Let
him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt
for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by them,
tormented them, accused them, kept his brother Benjamin, and all
through love: <q>I love you, and loving you I torment you.</q> For
he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants
in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands, he
had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a
strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he
loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them
in love. He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his
heart, flung himself on his bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears
away, he went out to them joyful and told them, <q>Brothers, I am
your brother Joseph!</q> Let him read them further how happy old
Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive, and how
he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign
land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously
hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring,
from Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the
Messiah and Saviour.
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don't be angry, that like a
little child I've been babbling of what you know long ago, and can
teach me a hundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture,
and forgive my tears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep,
the priest of God, and be sure that the hearts of his listeners will
throb in response. Only a little tiny seed is needed&mdash;drop it into
the heart of the peasant and it won't die, it will live in his soul
all his life, it will be hidden in the midst of his darkness and sin,
like a bright spot, like a great reminder. And there's no need of
much teaching or explanation, he will understand it all simply. Do
you suppose that the peasants don't understand? Try reading them
the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or
the miraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don't forget either the
parables of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>
(that is what I did), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the
conversion of St. Paul (that you mustn't leave out on any account),
and from the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>, for instance, the life of
Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of all, the happy martyr and the seer
of God, Mary of Egypt&mdash;and you will penetrate their hearts with
these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it in spite of your
poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for yourselves that
our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a hundred-fold.
Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words
they have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him
in his fields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect
than before&mdash;so that it will even increase his worldly well-being too.
The thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it
into words, for fear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is!
One who does not believe in God will not believe in God's people.
He who believes in God's people will see His Holiness too, even
though he had not believed in it till then. Only the people and
their future spiritual power will convert our atheists, who have torn
themselves away from their native soil.
</p>

<p>
And what is the use of Christ's words, unless we set an example?
The people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst
for the Word and for all that is good.
</p>

<p>
In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over
Russia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and
we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with
some fishermen. A good-looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined
us; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant's barge
along the bank. I noticed him looking straight before him with
clear and tender eyes. It was a bright, warm, still, July night, a
cool mist rose from the broad river, we could hear the plash of a
fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and beautiful, everything
praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, the lad and I,
and we talked of the beauty of this world of God's and of the great
mystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden
bee, all so marvelously know their path, though they have not intelligence,
they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually
accomplish it themselves. I saw the dear lad's heart was moved. He
told me that he loved the forest and the forest birds. He was a
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>
bird-catcher, knew the note of each of them, could call each bird.
<q>I know nothing better than to be in the forest,</q> said he, <q>though
all things are good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Truly,</q> I answered him, <q>all things are good and fair, because
all is truth. Look,</q> said I, <q>at the horse, that great beast that is so
near to man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works
for him; look at their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man,
who often beats them mercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence
and what beauty! It's touching to know that there's no sin
in them, for all, all except man, is sinless, and Christ has been
with them before us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why,</q> asked the boy, <q>is Christ with them too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It cannot but be so,</q> said I, <q>since the Word is for all. All
creation and all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing
glory to God, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing
this by the mystery of their sinless life. Yonder,</q> said I, <q>in the
forest wanders the dreadful bear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent
in it.</q> And I told him how once a bear came to a great
saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the wood. And the
great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear and gave him
a piece of bread. <q>Go along,</q> said he, <q>Christ be with you,</q> and
the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm.
And the lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without
hurting the saint, and that Christ was with him too. <q>Ah,</q> said
he, <q>how good that is, how good and beautiful is all God's work!</q>
He sat musing softly and sweetly. I saw he understood. And he
slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May God bless youth!
And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace and light
to Thy people!

</p>

<p>
I spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet
school at Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings
there, many of my childish impressions grew dimmer, though I
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>
forgot nothing. I picked up so many new habits and opinions that
I was transformed into a cruel, absurd, almost savage creature.
A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I did acquire
together with the French language.
</p>

<p>
But we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our
service as cattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect,
for I was so much more impressionable than my companions. By
the time we left the school as officers, we were ready to lay down
our lives for the honor of the regiment, but no one of us had any
knowledge of the real meaning of honor, and if any one had
known it, he would have been the first to ridicule it. Drunkenness,
debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves
on. I don't say that we were bad by nature, all these young men
were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.
What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own
money, and so I flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged
headlong into all the recklessness of youth.
</p>

<p>
I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one
book I never opened at that time, though I always carried it about
with me, and I was never separated from it; in very truth I was
keeping that book <q>for the day and the hour, for the month and
the year,</q> though I knew it not.
</p>

<p>
After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K.
where our regiment was stationed at the time. We found the
people of the town hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I
met with a cordial reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament
and was known to be well off, which always goes a long
way in the world. And then a circumstance happened which was
the beginning of it all.
</p>

<p>
I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl
of noble and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected.
They were well-to-do people of influence and position. They always
gave me a cordial and friendly reception. I fancied that the young
lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an
idea. Later on I saw and fully realized that I perhaps was not so
passionately in love with her at all, but only recognized the elevation
of her mind and character, which I could not indeed have helped
doing. I was prevented, however, from making her an offer at the
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>
time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with the allurements of
my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my youth, and
with my pockets full of money. I did drop some hint as to my
feelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a
time. Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to
another district.
</p>

<p>
On my return two months later, I found the young lady already
married to a rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still
young though older than I was, connected with the best Petersburg
society, which I was not, and of excellent education, which I also
was not. I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance
that my mind was positively clouded. The worst of it all was that,
as I learned then, the young landowner had been a long while betrothed
to her, and I had met him indeed many times in her house,
but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And this particularly
mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while I
knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With
flushed face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of
declaring my love to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me
or to warn me, she must, I concluded, have been laughing at me
all the time. Later on, of course, I reflected and remembered that
she had been very far from laughing at me; on the contrary, she
used to turn off any love-making on my part with a jest and begin
talking of other subjects; but at that moment I was incapable of
reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. I am surprised to
remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely
repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found
it difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to work
myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.
</p>

<p>
I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my <q>rival</q>
in the presence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly
extraneous pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public
event&mdash;it was in the year 1826<note place='foot'>Probably the public event was
the Decabrist plot against the Tsar, of December
1825, in which the most distinguished men in Russia were
concerned.&mdash;<hi rend='smallcaps'>Translator's
Note.</hi></note>&mdash;and my jeer was, so people said,
clever and effective. Then I forced him to ask for an explanation,
and behaved so rudely that he accepted my challenge in spite of the
vast inequality between us, as I was younger, a person of no consequence,
<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/>
and of inferior rank. I learned afterwards for a fact that
it was from a jealous feeling on his side also that my challenge was
accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on his wife's account before
their marriage; he fancied now that if he submitted to be insulted
by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she heard
of it, she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him.
I soon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In
those days though duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a
kind of fashion among the officers&mdash;so strong and deeply rooted
will a brutal prejudice sometimes be.
</p>

<p>
It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at
seven o'clock the next day on the outskirts of the town&mdash;and then
something happened that in very truth was the turning-point of my
life. In the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor,
I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him two blows
in the face with all my might, so that it was covered with blood.
He had not long been in my service and I had struck him before,
but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it's
forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went to bed
and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was
breaking. I got up&mdash;I did not want to sleep any more&mdash;I went
to the window&mdash;opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw
the sun rising; it was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the meaning of it?</q> I thought. <q>I feel in my heart as
it were something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to
shed blood? No,</q> I thought, <q>I feel it's not that. Can it be that
I am afraid of death, afraid of being killed? No, that's not it,
that's not it at all.</q>... And all at once I knew what it was: it
was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose
before my mind, it all was as it were repeated over again; he stood
before me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was
holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me
as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even
dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has
been brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature!
What a crime! It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me
right through. I stood as if I were struck dumb, while the sun
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the
praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands, fell on my bed and
broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my brother
Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: <q>My dear
ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your
waiting on me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, am I worth it?</q> flashed through my mind. <q>After all what
am I worth, that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness
and image of God, should serve me?</q> For the first time in my
life this question forced itself upon me. He had said, <q>Mother, my
little heart, in truth we are each responsible to all for all, it's only
that men don't know this. If they knew it, the world would be a
paradise at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God, can that too be false?</q> I thought as I wept. <q>In truth,
perhaps, I am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner
than all men in the world.</q> And all at once the whole truth in
its full light appeared to me; what was I going to do? I was going
to kill a good, clever, noble man, who had done me no wrong, and
by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life, I should
be torturing and killing her too. I lay thus in my bed with my
face in the pillow, heedless how the time was passing. Suddenly my
second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah,</q> said he, <q>it's a good thing you are up already, it's time we
were off, come along!</q>
</p>

<p>
I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we
went out to the carriage, however.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait here a minute,</q> I said to him. <q>I'll be back directly, I have
forgotten my purse.</q>
</p>

<p>
And I ran back alone, to Afanasy's little room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Afanasy,</q> I said, <q>I gave you two blows on the face yesterday,
forgive me,</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
He started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I
saw that it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer's uniform,
I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me,</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
Then he was completely aghast.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>

<p>
And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his
hands, turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I
flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ready,</q> I cried. <q>Have you ever seen a conqueror?</q> I asked
him. <q>Here is one before you.</q>
</p>

<p>
I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't remember
what about.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me. <q>Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll
keep up the honor of the uniform, I can see.</q>
</p>

<p>
So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We
were placed twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly,
looking him full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked
lovingly at him, for I knew what I would do. His shot just grazed
my cheek and ear.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God,</q> I cried, <q>no man has been killed,</q> and I seized my
pistol, turned back and flung it far away into the wood. <q>That's
the place for you,</q> I cried.
</p>

<p>
I turned to my adversary.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,</q> I said, <q>for my unprovoked
insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten
times worse than you and more, maybe. Tell that to the person
whom you hold dearest in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word,</q> cried my adversary, annoyed, <q>if you did not
want to fight, why did not you let me alone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,</q> I answered him
gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to
agree with your opinion,</q> said he.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo,</q> I cried, clapping my hands. <q>I agree with you there too.
I have deserved it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you shoot, sir, or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I won't,</q> I said; <q>if you like, fire at me again, but it would
be better for you not to fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: <q>Can you disgrace
the regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his
forgiveness! If I'd only known this!</q>
</p>

<p>
I stood facing them all, not laughing now.
</p>

<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> I said, <q>is it really so wonderful in these days to
find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his
wrongdoing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But not in a duel,</q> cried my second again.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what's so strange,</q> I said. <q>For I ought to have owned
my fault as soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before
leading him into a great and deadly sin; but we have made our life
so grotesque, that to act in that way would have been almost impossible,
for only after I have faced his shot at the distance of twelve
paces could my words have any significance for him, and if I had
spoken before, he would have said, <q>He is a coward, the sight of the
pistols has frightened him, no use to listen to him.</q> Gentlemen,</q> I
cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, <q>look around you
at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the
birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and
foolish, and we don't understand that life is heaven, for we have
only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its
beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.</q>
</p>

<p>
I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with
the sweetness and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss
in my heart as I had never known before in my life.
</p>

<p>
<q>All this as rational and edifying,</q> said my antagonist, <q>and in
any case you are an original person.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may laugh,</q> I said to him, laughing too, <q>but afterwards
you will approve of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,</q> said he; <q>will you shake
hands? for I believe you are genuinely sincere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> I said, <q>not now, later on when I have grown worthier and
deserve your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.</q>
</p>

<p>
We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I
kissed him. All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered
together to pass judgment on me the same day.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has disgraced the uniform,</q> they said; <q>let him resign his
commission.</q>
</p>

<p>
Some stood up for me: <q>He faced the shot,</q> they said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own
<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/>
pistol first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into
the forest. No, there's something else in this, something original.</q>
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed listening and looking at them. <q>My dear friends and
comrades,</q> said I, <q>don't worry about my resigning my commission,
for I have done so already. I have sent in my papers this morning
and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery&mdash;it's
with that object I am leaving the regiment.</q>
</p>

<p>
When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
<q>You should have told us of that first, that explains everything,
we can't judge a monk.</q>
</p>

<p>
They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully,
but kindly and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even
those who had been sternest in their censure, and all the following
month, before my discharge came, they could not make enough of
me. <q>Ah, you monk,</q> they would say. And every one said something
kind to me, they began trying to dissuade me, even to pity
me: <q>What are you doing to yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> they would say, <q>he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and
could have fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before
that he should become a monk, that's why he did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I
had been kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention,
and now all came to know me at once and invited me; they
laughed at me, but they loved me. I may mention that although
everybody talked openly of our duel, the authorities took no notice
of it, because my antagonist was a near relation of our general, and
as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences, and as
I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And I began then
to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter, for it was
always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversations mostly
took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women particularly
liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can I possibly be responsible for all?</q> every one would
laugh in my face. <q>Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may well not know it,</q> I would answer, <q>since the whole
world has long been going on a different line, since we consider
the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others. Here
I have for once in my life acted sincerely and, well, you all look
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>
upon me as a madman. Though you are friendly to me, yet, you
see, you all laugh at me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can we help being friendly to you?</q> said my hostess,
laughing. The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young
lady rose, on whose account the duel had been fought and whom
only lately I had intended to be my future wife. I had not noticed
her coming into the room. She got up, came to me and held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me tell you,</q> she said, <q>that I am the first not to laugh at
you, but on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my
respect for you for your action then.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and
almost kissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention
was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me
with the others. I knew him by name already, but had never made
his acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(d) The Mysterious Visitor</hi>
</p>

<p>
He had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent
position, respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence.
He subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan
asylum; he was very charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only
became known after his death. He was a man of about fifty, almost
stern in appearance and not much given to conversation. He had
been married about ten years and his wife, who was still young, had
borne him three children. Well, I was sitting alone in my room
the following evening, when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman
walked in.
</p>

<p>
I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my
former quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms
with an old lady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady's
servant waited upon me, for I had moved into her rooms simply
because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the
regiment, as I felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last
interview with him. So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed
of any righteous action.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> said my visitor, <q>with great interest listened to you
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
speaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last
to make your personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately.
Can you, dear sir, grant me this favor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an
honor.</q> I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I
impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man.
For though other people had listened to me with interest and attention,
no one had come to me before with such a serious, stern and
concentrated expression. And now he had come to see me in my
own rooms. He sat down.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,</q> he said;
<q>as you have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you
risked incurring the contempt of all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,</q> I replied.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not excessive,</q> he answered; <q>believe me, such a course
of action is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has
impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to
you,</q> he continued. <q>Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed
by my perhaps unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations,
if you can recall them, at the moment when you made up
your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel. Do not think my question
frivolous; on the contrary, I have in asking the question a secret
motive of my own, which I will perhaps explain to you later on, if
it is God's will that we should become more intimately acquainted.</q>
</p>

<p>
All the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into
the face and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great
curiosity on my side also, for I felt that there was some strange
secret in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I
asked my opponent's forgiveness,</q> I answered; <q>but I had better tell
you from the beginning what I have not yet told any one else.</q>
And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me, and
how I had bowed down to the ground at his feet. <q>From that you
can see for yourself,</q> I concluded, <q>that at the time of the duel it
was easier for me, for I had made a beginning already at home, and
when once I had started on that road, to go farther along it was far
from being difficult, but became a source of joy and happiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. <q>All that,</q> he
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
said, <q>is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening.
And we should have become greater friends, if only he had
ever talked of himself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a
word, yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of that I
became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him
about all my feelings; <q>for,</q> thought I, <q>what need have I to know
his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a good man?
Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he comes
to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.</q> And I
learned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man
of lofty mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>That life is heaven,</q> he said to me suddenly, <q>that I have long
been thinking about</q>; and all at once he added, <q>I think of nothing
else indeed.</q> He looked at me and smiled. <q>I am more convinced
of it than you are, I will tell you later why.</q>
</p>

<p>
I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell
me something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven,</q> he went on, <q>lies hidden within all of us&mdash;here it lies
hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow
and for all time.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing
mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own
sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how
you could comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in
very truth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven
will be for them not a dream, but a living reality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when,</q> I cried out to him bitterly, <q>when will that come
to pass? and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream
of ours?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What then, you don't believe it,</q> he said. <q>You preach it and
don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will
come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every
process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform
the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another
path psychologically. Until you have become really, in actual fact,
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
a brother to every one, brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort
of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach
men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for
all. Every one will think his share too small and they will be always
envying, complaining and attacking one another. You ask when it
will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go
through the period of isolation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by isolation?</q> I asked him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age&mdash;it
has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For
every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes
to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime
all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction,
for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at
complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into
units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds
aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends
by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches
by himself and thinks, <q>How strong I am now and how secure,</q> and
in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up,
the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed
to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the
whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others,
in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose
his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere
in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand
that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather
than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism
must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how
unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the
spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long
in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the Son
of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must
keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and
his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so
draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act
of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.</q>
</p>

<p>
Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
fervent talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less
frequently. Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not
as blame, for they still loved me and treated me good-humoredly,
but there's no denying that fashion is a great power in society. I
began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration, for besides
enjoying his intelligence, I began to perceive that he was brooding
over some plan in his heart, and was preparing himself perhaps for
a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his
secret, not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by insinuation.
But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show signs of wanting
to tell me something. This had become quite evident, indeed, about
a month after he first began to visit me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know,</q> he said to me once, <q>that people are very inquisitive
about us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so
often. But let them wonder, for <emph>soon all will be explained</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and
almost always on such occasions he would get up and go away.
Sometimes he would fix a long piercing look upon me, and I
thought, <q>He will say something directly now.</q> But he would
suddenly begin talking of something ordinary and familiar. He
often complained of headache too.
</p>

<p>
One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking
with great fervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his
face worked convulsively, while he stared persistently at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter?</q> I said; <q>do you feel ill?</q>&mdash;he had just
been complaining of headache.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.</q>
</p>

<p>
He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. <q>Why
is it he is smiling?</q> The thought flashed through my mind before I
realized anything else. I too turned pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you saying?</q> I cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see,</q> he said, with a pale smile, <q>how much it has cost me
to say the first word. Now I have said it, I feel I've taken the first
step and shall go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
For a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him
at that time, but only after he had been to see me three days running
and told me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended
<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>
by being convinced, to my great grief and amazement. His crime
was a great and terrible one.
</p>

<p>
Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner,
a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in
our town. He fell passionately in love with her, declared his feeling
and tried to persuade her to marry him. But she had already
given her heart to another man, an officer of noble birth and high
rank in the service, who was at that time away at the front, though
she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer
and begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to
visit her, he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter
at night through the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery.
But, as often happens, a crime committed with extraordinary
audacity is more successful than others.
</p>

<p>
Entering the garret through the skylight, he went down the
ladder, knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes,
through the negligence of the servants, left unlocked. He hoped
to find it so, and so it was. He made his way in the dark to her
bedroom, where a light was burning. As though on purpose, both
her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the same street, without
asking leave. The other servants slept in the servants' quarters
or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passion flamed up at the
sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger took possession
of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he
thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then
with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion
should fall on the servants. He was so base as to take her purse,
to open her chest with keys from under her pillow, and to take
some things from it, doing it all as it might have been done by an
ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers and taking only money.
He took some of the larger gold things, but left smaller articles
that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too, some
things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done
this awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.
</p>

<p>
Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any
time after in his life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was
the criminal. No one indeed knew of his love for her, for he was
always reserved and silent and had no friend to whom he would
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>
have opened his heart. He was looked upon simply as an acquaintance,
and not a very intimate one, of the murdered woman, as for
the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf of hers
called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance confirmed
the suspicion. The man knew&mdash;indeed his mistress did not
conceal the fact&mdash;that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit
she had decided to send him, as he had no relations and his conduct
was unsatisfactory. People had heard him angrily threatening to
murder her when he was drunk in a tavern. Two days before her
death, he had run away, staying no one knew where in the town.
The day after the murder, he was found on the road leading out of
the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his right hand
happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose had
been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that
they had gone to a party and that the street-door had been left
open till they returned. And a number of similar details came to
light, throwing suspicion on the innocent servant.
</p>

<p>
They arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week
after the arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious
in the hospital. There the matter ended and the judges and
the authorities and every one in the town remained convinced that
the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had
died in the hospital. And after that the punishment began.
</p>

<p>
My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he
was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable
a long time, but not for that reason; only from regret that
he had killed the woman he loved, that she was no more, that in
killing her he had killed his love, while the fire of passion was still
in his veins. But of the innocent blood he had shed, of the murder
of a fellow creature, he scarcely thought. The thought that his
victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable
to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in his conscience
that he could not have acted otherwise.
</p>

<p>
At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness
and death soon set his mind at rest, for the man's death was apparently
(so he reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his
fright, but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away, when he
had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground. The theft of
<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>
the money and other things troubled him little, for he argued that
the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion.
The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards subscribed the
whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for maintaining an
almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his conscience
at rest about the theft, and it's a remarkable fact that for a long
time he really was at peace&mdash;he told me this himself. He entered
then upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for
a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and
being a man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he
recalled it, he tried not to think of it at all. He became active in
philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many institutions
in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow
and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies.
</p>

<p>
At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain
of it was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and
intelligent girl and soon after married her, hoping that marriage
would dispel his lonely depression, and that by entering on a new
life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and children, he
would escape from old memories altogether. But the very opposite
of what he expected happened. He began, even in the first month
of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the thought, <q>My wife
loves me&mdash;but what if she knew?</q> When she first told him that
she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. <q>I am giving life,
but I have taken life.</q> Children came. <q>How dare I love them,
teach and educate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have
shed blood.</q> They were splendid children, he longed to caress them;
<q>and I can't look at their innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the
blood of his murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed,
by the blood that cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have
awful dreams. But, being a man of fortitude, he bore his suffering
a long time, thinking: <q>I shall expiate everything by this secret
agony.</q> But that hope, too, was vain; the longer it went on, the
more intense was his suffering.
</p>

<p>
He was respected in society for his active benevolence, though
every one was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But
the more he was respected, the more intolerable it was for him. He
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>
confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself. But he
began to be haunted by another idea&mdash;an idea which he had at first
regarded as impossible and unthinkable, though at last it got such
a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off. He dreamed of
rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all men that
he had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued
him, haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his
whole heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul
and would be at peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with
terror, for how could he carry it out? And then came what happened
at my duel.
</p>

<p>
<q>Looking at you, I have made up my mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it possible,</q> I cried, clasping my hands, <q>that such a trivial
incident could give rise to such a resolution in you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My resolution has been growing for the last three years,</q> he
answered, <q>and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking
at you, I reproached myself and envied you.</q> He said this to me
almost sullenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you won't be believed,</q> I observed; <q>it's fourteen years
ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then I cried and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me one thing, one thing,</q> he said (as though it all depended
upon me), <q>my wife, my children! My wife may die of
grief, and though my children won't lose their rank and property,
they'll be a convict's children and for ever! And what a memory,
what a memory of me I shall leave in their hearts!</q>
</p>

<p>
I said nothing.
</p>

<p>
<q>And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It's for ever,
you know, for ever!</q>
</p>

<p>
I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt
afraid.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q> He looked at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go!</q> said I, <q>confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains.
Your children will understand, when they grow up, the nobility
of your resolution.</q>
</p>

<p>
He left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
for more than a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening,
still preparing himself, still unable to bring himself to the
point. He made my heart ache. One day he would come determined
and say fervently:
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess.
Fourteen years I've been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take
