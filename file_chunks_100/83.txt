Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish
spirit&mdash;whatever it is! Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine,
how clear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it's still summer;
four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness! Where were you
going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's
first.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny
of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and
to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with
father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted
to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you really mean to send me?</q> cried Alyosha with a distressed
expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once.
But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's why
you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is her note.</q> Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya
looked through it quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for
sending him by the back-way, and he came to me like the golden
fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen,
brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some
one. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell an
angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and
judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that some one above
me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything
on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,
and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and
says, <q>Do this for me</q>&mdash;some favor never asked before that could
only be asked on one's deathbed&mdash;would that other refuse, if he were
a friend or a brother?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste! H'm!... Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you
hurry and worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the
world has taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't
understand ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you
didn't understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying?
<q>Be noble, O man!</q>&mdash;who says that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed,
his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were
silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> said Mitya, <q rend='pre'>you're the only one who won't laugh.
I should like to begin&mdash;my confession&mdash;with Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Hymn

There's a terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible

wallowing in dirt and drink. I hardly think of anything but

<p>
But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I
don't kiss her. I don't cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a
peasant or a shepherd? I go on and I don't know whether I'm going
to shame or to light and joy. That's the trouble, for everything in
the world is a riddle! And whenever I've happened to sink into the
vilest degradation (and it's always been happening) I always read
that poem about Ceres and man. Has it reformed me? Never!
For I'm a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong
with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that
degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very
depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be
accursed. Let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the
veil in which my God is shrouded. Though I may be following
the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the
joy without which the world cannot stand.

because sensual lust is a tempest&mdash;worse than a tempest! Beauty
is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been
fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but
riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side
by side. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I've thought a
lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many
riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as we can,
and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't endure
the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the
ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's
still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul
does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be
on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth
and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed. I'd have him
narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it! What to the
mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind
beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The
awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and
the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man.
But a man always talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to
facts.</q>

<head>Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;In Anecdote</head>

<p>
<q>I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I
spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That's
a swinish invention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if
there was, I didn't need money simply for <emph>that</emph>. With me money is
an accessory, the overflow of my heart, the framework. To-day she
would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out of the streets in her
place. I entertained them both. I threw away money by the handful
on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the ladies,
too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be
pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of
them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths,
little dark back-alleys behind the main road&mdash;there one finds adventures
and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking
figuratively, brother. In the town I was in, there were no such
back-alleys in the literal sense, but morally there were. If you were
like me, you'd know what that means. I loved vice, I loved the
ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a
noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole lot
of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and
I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her to kiss me. She
was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature.
She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She thought,
poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer
(I was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't say a word
to her for five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we
were always having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how
they glowed with fire&mdash;a fire of gentle indignation. This game
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul. Five months
later she married an official and left the town, still angry, and still,
perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily. Observe that
I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low desires,
and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable. You're blushing; your
eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this was
nothing much&mdash;wayside blossoms <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
la</foreign> Paul de Kock&mdash;though the
cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect
album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I
tried to break it off without quarreling. And I never gave them
away. I never bragged of one of them. But that's enough. You
can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense.
No, I'm going to tell you something more curious; and don't be surprised
that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You say that because I blushed,</q> Alyosha said suddenly. <q>I
wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I
blushed because I am the same as you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You? Come, that's going a little too far!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not too far,</q> said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea
was not a new one). <q>The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom
step, and you're above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's
how I see it. But it's all the same. Absolutely the same in kind.
Any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then one ought not to step on at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Any one who can help it had better not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you
touch me so. That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told
me once that she'd devour you one day. There, there, I won't!
From this field of corruption fouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy,
also befouled by flies, that is by every sort of vileness. Although
the old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was
something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and
then it did not come off. The old man who has reproached me
with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never
told any one about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course&mdash;Ivan
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But
Ivan's a tomb.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's a tomb?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened with great attention.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,
like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in
the little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be
rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other
ways as well. Although they shook their heads over me, they
liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike
to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends,
and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn't do me
much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with
proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was
really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two
wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left
a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of
four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father
and an aunt, her mother's sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate;
the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things about
people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than
Agafya&mdash;fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn't
bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full
figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had not
married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but
was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in <q>that</q> way,
it was pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women
quite innocently. I used to talk to her with shocking frankness,
and she only laughed. Many women like such freedom, and she
was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one
could never think of her as a young lady. She and her aunt lived
in her father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting
themselves on an equality with other people. She was a general
favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever dressmaker.
She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without asking
for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn't refuse.
The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained
the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I
arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the
expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty,
who had just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second
daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second
wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although, as
I learnt on good authority, she too brought the colonel no money.
She had connections, and that was all. There may have been expectations,
but they had come to nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit,
the whole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies&mdash;two <q>Excellencies</q>
and a colonel's wife&mdash;and all the rest following their
lead, at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honor.
She was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tableaux vivants</foreign>
in aid of distressed governesses. I took no notice, I went
on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at the time set all the
town talking. I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the
battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained
her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an evening
party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed her
lips scornfully. <q>Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,</q> thought I. I
behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I
was conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt
that <q>Katenka</q> was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a
person of character, proud and really high-principled; above all, she
had education and intellect, and I had neither. You think I meant
to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge myself,
because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to feel it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel
put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father
sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed
giving up all claims upon him&mdash;settling our accounts, so to speak,
and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more. I didn't understand
a word of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha, till
the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been able to
make head or tail of my money affairs with father. But never
mind that, we'll talk of it later.</q>
</p>

<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling
me something that interested me immensely. The authorities,
I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected
of irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise
for him. And then the commander of the division arrived,
and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was
ordered to retire. I won't tell you how it all happened. He had
enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the
town towards him and all his family. His friends all turned their
backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya Ivanovna,
with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, <q>Do you know
there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your
father's accounts?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general
was here not long ago, and everything was all right.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Then it was, but now it isn't.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She was terribly scared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Don't frighten me!</q> she said. <q>Who told you so?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Don't be uneasy,</q> I said, <q>I won't tell any one. You know
I'm as silent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of <q>possibilities,</q>
to add, that when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your
father, and he can't produce it, he'll be tried, and made to serve
as a common soldier in his old age, unless you like to send me
your young lady secretly. I've just had money paid me. I'll give
her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Ah, you scoundrel!</q>&mdash;that's what she said. <q>You wicked
scoundrel! How dare you!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her
once more that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple
creatures, Agafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved
like perfect angels all through this business. They genuinely adored
their <q>Katya,</q> thought her far above them, and waited on her, hand
and foot. But Agafya told her of our conversation. I found that
out afterwards. She didn't keep it back, and of course that was
all I wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion.
The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't
leave his room for two days, and didn't hand over the government
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
money. Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill. But I
knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the last
four years the money had never been in his hands except when the
Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend it to a
trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old
widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to
go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return
the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present from the
fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time (I heard all about
it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth
and one of the most vicious in the world)&mdash;this time, I say, Trifonov
brought nothing back from the fair. The lieutenant-colonel flew
to him. <q>I've never received any money from you, and couldn't
possibly have received any.</q> That was all the answer he got. So
now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel
round his head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it. All
at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order
to <q>hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.</q>
He signed the book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards),
stood up, saying he would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom,
loaded his double-barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot
off his right foot, fixed the gun against his chest, and began feeling
for the trigger with his foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had
told her, had her suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room
just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon him from behind,
threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling,
but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held
him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home,
it was getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had
dressed, brushed my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up
my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and facing me in the room
stood Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen
her in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged
with two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most
obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request
were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts. Of course I
grasped the position at once. She walked in and looked straight at
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>
me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her lips and round
her mouth I saw uncertainty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>My sister told me,</q> she began, <q>that you would give me 4,500
roubles if I came to you for it&mdash;myself. I have come ... give me
the money!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her
voice failed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it
quivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,</q> said Alyosha in
agitation.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened
I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a&mdash;Karamazov one. Once
I was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with
fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then&mdash;a
noxious insect, you understand? I looked her up and down.
You've seen her? She's a beauty. But she was beautiful in another
way then. At that moment she was beautiful because she was
noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her generosity
and sacrifice for her father, and I&mdash;a bug! And, scoundrel
as I was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She
was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous
thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense.
It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I
should act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of
pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I should have gone
next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end honorably, so
to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though I'm a
man of base desires, I'm honest. And at that very second some voice
seemed to whisper in my ear, <q>But when you come to-morrow to
make your proposal, that girl won't even see you; she'll order her
coachman to kick you out of the yard. <q>Publish it through all
the town,</q> she would say, <q>I'm not afraid of you.</q></q> I looked at
the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That is how it
would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from her face now that I
should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. I longed
to play her the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at her with a
sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with
a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.</q>
</p>

<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You've
been counting your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred,
if you like, with all my heart. But four thousand is not a sum to
throw away on such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no
purpose.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I should have lost the game, of course. She'd have run away.
But it would have been an infernal revenge. It would have been
worth it all. I'd have howled with regret all the rest of my life,
only to have played that trick. Would you believe it, it has never
happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her at
such a moment with hatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for
three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred&mdash;that hate which
is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane,
and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep
her long, don't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table,
opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles
(it was lying in a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in
silence, folded it, handed it to her, opened the door into the passage,
and, stepping back, made her a deep bow, a most respectful, a most
impressive bow, believe me! She shuddered all over, gazed at me
for a second, turned horribly pale&mdash;white as a sheet, in fact&mdash;and
all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently, bowed down to my
feet&mdash;not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow, with her
forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing
my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot;
why, I don't know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of
course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that
one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn't stab myself. I
only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard&mdash;which there
was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in
telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to
glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into
the human heart! Well, so much for that <q>adventure</q> with Katerina
Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you&mdash;no one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out
his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha
had to turn quite round to face him.

<p>
<q>Now,</q> said Alyosha, <q>I understand the first half.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You understand the first half. That half is a drama,
and it was played out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is
being acted here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I understand nothing of that second half so far,</q> said
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I? Do you suppose I understand it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, Dmitri. There's one important question. Tell me, you
were betrothed, you are betrothed still?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We weren't betrothed at once, not for three months after that
adventure. The next day I told myself that the incident was closed,
concluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish
to make her an offer. On her side she gave no sign of life for the
six weeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one
action. The day after her visit the maid-servant slipped round
with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the
change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles
was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on
changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I
don't remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation.
I searched the packet for a pencil mark&mdash;n-nothing! Well, I spent
the rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was
obliged to reprimand me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to
the astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the
money untouched. He'd no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to
his bed, and, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he
died five days afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for
he had not had time to receive his discharge. Ten days after his
funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with her aunt and sister, went to Moscow.
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
And, behold, on the very day they went away (I hadn't seen
them, didn't see them off or take leave) I received a tiny note, a
sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line in pencil: <q>I will
write to you. Wait. K.</q> And that was all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes
changed with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness
of an Arabian fairy-tale. That general's widow, their nearest
relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and
next-of-kin&mdash;both died in the same week of small-pox. The old
lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her
one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in Katya's favor. But
that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for present use,
eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she liked
with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in
Moscow, later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred
roubles. I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three
days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now. You
must read it. She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. <q>I
love you madly,</q> she says, <q>even if you don't love me, never mind.
Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way.
I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet. I want
to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.</q> Alyosha,
I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in
my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure
myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't
mind&mdash;that I don't mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it
was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears.
One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her being
rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar! I
mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it
slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him
all I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her.
Why do you look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes,
Ivan fell in love with her; he's in love with her still. I know that.
I did a stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one
stupid thing may be the saving of us all now. Oo! Don't you see
what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she respects him? When she
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>
compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like me, especially
after all that has happened here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not
a man like him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She loves her own <emph>virtue</emph>, not me.</q> The words broke involuntarily,
and almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a
minute later his eyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the
table violently with his fist.
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear, Alyosha,</q> he cried, with intense and genuine anger at
himself; <q>you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ
is God, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just
now, I know that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and
that these lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly
angel's. That's the tragedy of it&mdash;that I know that for certain.
What if any one does show off a bit? Don't I do it myself? And
yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how
he must be cursing nature now&mdash;with his intellect, too! To see the
preference given&mdash;to whom, to what? To a monster who, though
he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his debaucheries&mdash;and
before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man
like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a
girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's
ridiculous! I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of
course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny
will be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while
the undeserving one will vanish into his back-alley for ever&mdash;his
filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is at home and
where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with
enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I use
them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the
back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, Dmitri,</q> Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety.
<q>There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed
all the same, aren't you? How can you break off the
engagement if she, your betrothed, doesn't want to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my
arrival in Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine
style. The general's wife blessed us, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;congratulated
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
Katya. <q>You've made a good choice,</q> she said, <q>I see
right through him.</q> And&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;she didn't like
Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of talk with Katya in
Moscow. I told her about myself&mdash;sincerely, honorably. She
listened to everything.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>There was sweet confusion,</l>
<l>There were tender words.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>Though there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a
mighty promise to reform. I gave my promise, and here&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very
day&mdash;remember it&mdash;to send you&mdash;this very day again&mdash;to Katerina
Ivanovna, and&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, <q>He
sends you his compliments.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But is that possible?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just the reason I'm sending you, in my place, because it's
impossible. And, how could I tell her myself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where are you going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To the back-alley.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Grushenka, then!</q> Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping
his hands. <q>Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought
that you had just visited her, and that was all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible
and with such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world?
Confound it, I have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka,
I ceased to be betrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand
that. Why do you look at me? You see, I went in the
first place to beat her. I had heard, and I know for a fact now, that
that captain, father's agent, had given Grushenka an I.O.U. of
mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an end to me.
They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a glimpse
of her before. She doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about
her old merchant, who's lying ill now, paralyzed; but he's leaving
her a decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money,
that she hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
she's a merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I
stayed. The storm broke&mdash;it struck me down like the plague. I'm
plague-stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that there
will never be anything more for me. The cycle of the ages is
accomplished. That's my position. And though I'm a beggar, as
fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket. I
drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from
here. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants
there drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands
flying. In three days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you
suppose the hero had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I
tell you that rogue, Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her body.
You can see it in her little foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and
kissed it, but that was all, I swear! <q>I'll marry you if you like,</q> she
said, <q>you're a beggar, you know. Say that you won't beat me, and
will let me do anything I choose, and perhaps I will marry you.</q>
She laughed, and she's laughing still!</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as
though he were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you really mean to marry her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At once, if she will. And if she won't, I shall stay all the same.
I'll be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!</q> he cried. He stopped
short before him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking
him violently. <q>Do you know, you innocent boy, that this is all
delirium, senseless delirium, for there's a tragedy here. Let me tell
you, Alexey, that I may be a low man, with low and degraded passions,
but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri Karamazov never can
be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and a pickpocket.
That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka, Katerina
Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don't know, I
suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of
the province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna
in Moscow, so that nothing should be known of it in the town here.
So I had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to
see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards
I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her the
post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring
the receipt, and so far I haven't brought it. I've forgotten it. Now
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>
what do you think you're going to her to-day to say? <q>He sends his
compliments,</q> and she'll ask you, <q>What about the money?</q> You
might still have said to her, <q>He's a degraded sensualist, and a low
creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn't send your money
then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn't control
himself.</q> But still you might have added, <q>He isn't a thief though.
Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to
Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say <q>he sends his compliments.</q></q>
But, as it is, she will ask, <q>But where is the money?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think.
Don't worry yourself to death with despair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, do you suppose I'd shoot myself because I can't get three
thousand to pay back? That's just it. I shan't shoot myself. I
haven't the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I'm
going to Grushenka. I don't care what happens.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers
come, I'll go into the next room. I'll clean her friends' goloshes,
blow up their samovar, run their errands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,</q> Alyosha said solemnly.
<q>She'll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She
has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you.
She'll see that for herself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She won't forgive everything,</q> said Dmitri, with a grin.
<q>There's something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do
you know what would be the best thing to do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pay back the three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan
will give you another thousand&mdash;that makes three. Take it and pay
it back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when would you get it, your three thousand? You're not
of age, besides, and you must&mdash;you absolutely must&mdash;take my farewell
to her to-day, with the money or without it, for I can't drag
on any longer, things have come to such a pass. To-morrow is too
late. I shall send you to father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.</q>
</p>

<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>

<p>
<q>But, Mitya, he won't give it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As though he would! I know he won't. Do you know the
meaning of despair, Alexey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I've had it all from him,
I know that. But morally he owes me something, doesn't he? You
know he started with twenty-eight thousand of my mother's
money and made a hundred thousand with it. Let him give me
back only three out of the twenty-eight thousand, and he'll draw
my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many of his sins. For
that three thousand&mdash;I give you my solemn word&mdash;I'll make an
end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the
last time I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God
Himself sends him this chance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, he won't give it for anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know he won't. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially.
That's not all. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago,
perhaps only yesterday he found out for the first time <emph>in earnest</emph>
(underline <emph>in earnest</emph>) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking,
and really means to marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the
cat. And do you suppose he's going to give me money to help to
bring that about when he's crazy about her himself? And that's
not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I know that for the
last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank,
changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large envelope,
sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see
how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: <q>To my
angel, Grushenka, when she will come to me.</q> He scrawled it himself
in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money's there
except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now
he has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days; he
hopes she'll come for the money. He has sent her word of it, and
she has sent him word that perhaps she'll come. And if she does
go to the old man, can I marry her after that? You understand
now why I'm here in secret and what I'm on the watch for.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here.
Foma comes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
does jobs for them. He's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting
in the day-time; and that's how he lives. I've established myself
in his room. Neither he nor the women of the house know the
secret&mdash;that is, that I am on the watch here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was he told you about the money, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. It's a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn't know about the
money, or anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya
on a two or three days' journey. A purchaser has turned up for
the copse: he'll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old
man keeps asking Ivan to help him by going to arrange it. It will
take him two or three days. That's what the old man wants, so
that Grushenka can come while he's away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he's expecting Grushenka to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't come to-day; there are signs. She's certain not
to come,</q> cried Mitya suddenly. <q>Smerdyakov thinks so, too.
Father's drinking now. He's sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him,
Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, dear, what's the matter with you?</q> cried Alyosha, jumping
up from his place, and looking keenly at his brother's frenzied
face. For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was
mad.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it? I'm not insane,</q> said Dmitri, looking intently and
earnestly at him. <q>No fear. I am sending you to father, and I
know what I'm saying. I believe in miracles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In miracles?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He
sees my despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won't let
something awful happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I know it will take some time. You can't go at him point
blank. He's drunk now. I'll wait three hours&mdash;four, five, six,
seven. Only remember you must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if
it has to be at midnight, <emph>with the money or without the money</emph>,
and say, <q>He sends his compliments to you.</q> I want you to say that
verse to her: <q>He sends his compliments to you.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>

<p>
<q>Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-day&mdash;if not to-day,
to-morrow, or the next day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And if&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If there's an if, it will be murder. I couldn't endure it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who will be murdered?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The old man. I shan't kill her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, what are you saying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I don't know.... I don't know. Perhaps I shan't kill,
and perhaps I shall. I'm afraid that he will suddenly become so
loathsome to me with his face at that moment. I hate his ugly
throat, his nose, his eyes, his shameless snigger. I feel a physical
repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of. That's what may be too
much for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best,
that nothing awful may happen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn't
come to pass&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his father's house.
</p>

<head>Chapter VI. Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was
a dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the
drawing-room, which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned
ostentation. The furniture was white and very old, upholstered
in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the
windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of
old-fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper,
which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits&mdash;one
of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty
years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In
the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which
a lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional
purposes as to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to
<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>
bed very late, at three or four o'clock in the morning, and would
wander about the room at night or sit in an arm-chair, thinking.
This had become a habit with him. He often slept quite alone in
the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov
remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.
</p>

<p>
When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves
had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with
brandy after dinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The
servants, Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the
gentlemen and the servants seemed in singularly good spirits. Fyodor
Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter. Before he entered the
room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so well, and could
tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached the good-humored
stage, and was far from being completely drunk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here he is! Here he is!</q> yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted
at seeing Alyosha. <q>Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten
dish, but it's hot and good. I don't offer you brandy, you're keeping
the fast. But would you like some? No; I'd better give you
some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the
second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look sharp!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind. If you won't have it, we will,</q> said Fyodor Pavlovitch,
beaming. <q>But stay&mdash;have you dined?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece
of bread and drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior's kitchen.
<q>Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo, my darling! He'll have some coffee. Does it want
warming? No, it's boiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's making.
My Smerdyakov's an artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at
fish soup, too. You must come one day and have some fish soup.
Let me know beforehand.... But, stay; didn't I tell you this
morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all?
Have you brought your mattress? He he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I haven't,</q> said Alyosha, smiling, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning,
weren't you? There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex
you. Do you know, Ivan, I can't resist the way he looks one straight
in the face and laughs? It makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>
of him. Alyosha, let me give you my blessing&mdash;a father's blessing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his
mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no,</q> he said. <q>I'll just make the sign of the cross over you,
for now. Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own line,
too. It'll make you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to us
here&mdash;and how he talks! How he talks!</q>
</p>

<p>
Balaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a
young man of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and
taciturn. Not that he was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he
was conceited and seemed to despise everybody.
</p>

<p>
But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was
brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up <q>with no
sense of gratitude,</q> as Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly
boy, and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully. In his childhood
he was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with
great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were
a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead cat as
though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the greatest
secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a
sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a
week. <q>He doesn't care for you or me, the monster,</q> Grigory used
to say to Marfa, <q>and he doesn't care for any one. Are you a human
being?</q> he said, addressing the boy directly. <q>You're not a
human being. You grew from the mildew in the bath-house.<note place='foot'>A
proverbial expression in Russia.</note>
That's what you are.</q> Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could
never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to read and
write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the
Scriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or
third lesson the boy suddenly grinned.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that for?</q> asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly
from under his spectacles.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun,
moon, and stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from
on the first day?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his
teacher. There was something positively condescending in his expression.
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>
Grigory could not restrain himself. <q>I'll show you
where!</q> he cried, and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek. The
boy took the slap without a word, but withdrew into his corner
again for some days. A week later he had his first attack of the
disease to which he was subject all the rest of his life&mdash;epilepsy.
When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy seemed
changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though
he never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met
him. Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the
boy something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his
illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and
tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The fits
occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals.
The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very
severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal
punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to come upstairs
to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a
time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch
noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles
through the glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books&mdash;over
a hundred&mdash;but no one ever saw him reading. He at once
gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. <q>Come, read. You
shall be my librarian. You'll be better sitting reading than hanging
about the courtyard. Come, read this,</q> and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave
him <hi rend='italic'>Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka</hi>.
</p>

<p>
He read a little but didn't like it. He did not once smile, and
ended by frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? Isn't it funny?</q> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov did not speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>Answer, stupid!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all untrue,</q> mumbled the boy, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay,
here's Smaragdov's <hi rend='italic'>Universal History</hi>. That's all true. Read
that.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov.
He thought it dull. So the bookcase was closed again.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch
that Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary
fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>
spoon and look into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a
spoonful and hold it to the light.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it? A beetle?</q> Grigory would ask.
</p>

<p>
<q>A fly, perhaps,</q> observed Marfa.
</p>

<p>
The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with
his bread, his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece
on his fork to the light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after
long deliberation decide to put it in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs!</q> Grigory muttered, looking
at him.
</p>

<p>
When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov
he determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow
to be trained. He spent some years there and came back remarkably
changed in appearance. He looked extraordinarily old for his
age. His face had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate.
In character he seemed almost exactly the same as before he
went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not the slightest
inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard
afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little interest
for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice
of anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and
displeased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from
Moscow well dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed
his clothes most scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very
fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special English polish,
so that they shone like mirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook.
Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the whole of which
Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things.
But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for
men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor
Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were becoming
more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked,
which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are your fits getting worse?</q> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch,
looking askance at his new cook. <q>Would you like to get married?
Shall I find you a wife?</q>
</p>

<p>
But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply.
Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>
thing was that he had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened
once, when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in
the muddy courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he had only
just received. He only missed them next day, and was just hastening
to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table.
Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked them up and
brought them in the day before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
said shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he
not only believed in his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking
for him, although the young man looked as morosely at him as at
every one and was always silent. He rarely spoke. If it had occurred
to any one to wonder at the time what the young man was
interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have been impossible
to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop
suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand
still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his
face would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection,
but only a sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by
the painter Kramskoy, called <q>Contemplation.</q> There is a forest in
winter, and on a roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude,
stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it
were, lost in thought. Yet he is not thinking; he is <q>contemplating.</q>
If any one touched him he would start and look at one as
though awakening and bewildered. It's true he would come to
himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been thinking
about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden
within himself, the impression which had dominated him during
the period of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and
no doubt he hoards them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously.
How and why, of course, he does not know either. He may suddenly,
after hoarding impressions for many years, abandon everything
and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his soul's salvation,
or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native village, and perhaps
do both. There are a good many <q>contemplatives</q> among the
peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he
probably was greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing
why.

<head>Chapter VII. The Controversy</head>

<p>
But Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a
strange one. Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases,
and had heard from the shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of
a Russian soldier which had appeared in the newspaper of that day.
This soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia,
and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death if he did
not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny
his faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and
glorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor
Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and
talk, if only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly
good-humored and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening
to the story, he observed that they ought to make a saint of a
soldier like that, and to take his skin to some monastery. <q>That
would make the people flock, and bring the money in.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means
touched, but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment
Smerdyakov, who was standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov
often waited at table towards the end of dinner, and since Ivan's
arrival in our town he had done so every day.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you grinning at?</q> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching
the smile instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, my opinion is,</q> Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly
in a loud voice, <q>that if that laudable soldier's exploit was
so very great there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it
if he had on such an emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of
Christ and his own christening, to save by that same his life, for
good deeds, by which, in the course of years to expiate his cowardice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that
you'll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,</q> put in
Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>

<p>
It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch,
as we have seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.
</p>

<p>
<q>We're on your subject, your subject,</q> he chuckled gleefully,
making Alyosha sit down to listen.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for
this, and there shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,</q>
Smerdyakov maintained stoutly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean <q>according to justice</q>?</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cried still more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a rascal, that's what he is!</q> burst from Grigory. He looked
Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,</q>
answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure. <q>You'd better consider
yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the
Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God
and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by
my own reason, since there would be no sin in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,</q>
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Soup-maker!</q> muttered Grigory contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for
yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as
I say to those enemies, <q>No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my
true God,</q> then at once, by God's high judgment, I become immediately
and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the
Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that
very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying
it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off. Is that
so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was
really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware
of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the
questions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, <q>stoop down for me
to whisper. He's got this all up for your benefit. He wants you
to praise him. Praise him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his father's excited
whisper.
</p>

<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>

<p>
<q>Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch
once more. <q>Ivan, your ear again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.
</p>

<p>
<q>I love you as I do Alyosha. Don't think I don't love you. Some
brandy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.&mdash;But you're rather drunk yourself,</q> thought Ivan, looking
steadily at his father.
</p>

<p>
He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're anathema accursed, as it is,</q> Grigory suddenly burst
out, <q>and how dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't scold him, Grigory, don't scold him,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cut him short.
</p>

<p>
<q>You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time,
and listen, for I haven't finished all I had to say. For at the very
moment I become accursed, at that same highest moment, I become
exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes
of no avail. Isn't that so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste and finish, my boy,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him,
sipping from his wine-glass with relish.
</p>

<p>
<q>And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the
enemy when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian,
seeing I had already been relieved by God Himself of my
Christianity by reason of the thought alone, before I had time to
utter a word to the enemy. And if I have already been discharged,
in what manner and with what sort of justice can I be held responsible
as a Christian in the other world for having denied Christ, when,
through the very thought alone, before denying Him I had been
relieved from my christening? If I'm no longer a Christian, then
I can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to renounce. Who
will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even
in heaven, for not having been born a Christian? And who would
punish him for that, considering that you can't take two skins off
one ox? For God Almighty Himself, even if He did make the
Tatar responsible, when he dies would give him the smallest possible
punishment, I imagine (since he must be punished), judging that
he is not to blame if he has come into the world an unclean heathen,
from heathen parents. The Lord God can't surely take a Tatar and
say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>
would tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth
tell a lie, even in one word?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes
nearly starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand
what was said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and
stood, looking like a man who has just hit his head against a wall.
Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his glass and went off into his shrill
laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist!
He must have been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh,
you stinking Jesuit, who taught you? But you're talking nonsense,
you casuist, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don't cry, Grigory, we'll
reduce him to smoke and ashes in a moment. Tell me this, O ass;
you may be right before your enemies, but you have renounced your
faith all the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in
that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once you're
anathema they won't pat you on the head for it in hell. What do
you say to that, my fine Jesuit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart,
but there was no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the
most ordinary.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How's that the most ordinary?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You lie, accursed one!</q> hissed Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,</q> Smerdyakov went on,
staid and unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous
to the vanquished foe. <q>Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch;
it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a
mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move
without the least delay at your bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
if I'm without faith and you have so great a faith that you
are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain,
not to move into the sea for that's a long way off, but even
to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden.
You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will remain just
where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory
Vassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper manner, and only
abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one
in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea&mdash;except
perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and
they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the
Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them&mdash;if so it be, if all the
rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population
of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert,
and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them?
And so I'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall
be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. <q>So
you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan,
make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all
over!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the people's
faith,</q> Ivan assented, with an approving smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't it,
Alyosha? That's the Russian faith all over, isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,</q> said Alyosha
firmly and gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert,
only that idea. Surely that's Russian, isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that's purely Russian,</q> said Alyosha smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to you
to-day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only
from carelessness, because we haven't time; things are too much for
us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time,
only twenty-four hours in the day, so that one hasn't even time to
get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's sins. While you have
denied your faith to your enemies when you'd nothing else to think
about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes
a sin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had
believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really
would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith,
and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course,
it wouldn't have come to torture then, because I should only have
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>
had to say at that instant to the mountain, <q>Move and crush the
tormentor,</q> and it would have moved and at the very instant have
crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have walked away as
though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God. But,
suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that
mountain, <q>Crush these tormentors,</q> and it hadn't crushed them,
how could I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such
a dread hour of mortal terror? And apart from that, I should know
already that I could not attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of
Heaven (for since the mountain had not moved at my word, they
could not think very much of my faith up aloft, and there could
be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come). So
why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no good
purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my
back, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or
at my cry. And at such a moment not only doubt might come over
one but one might lose one's reason from fear, so that one would
not be able to think at all. And, therefore, how should I be particularly
to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or
here, I should, at least, save my skin. And so trusting fully in the
grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be altogether
forgiven.</q>

<head>Chapter VIII. Over The Brandy</head>

<p>
The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
who had been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He
frowned and gulped brandy, and it was already a glass too much.
</p>

<p>
<q>Get along with you, Jesuits!</q> he cried to the servants. <q>Go
away, Smerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day,
but be off! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She'll comfort
you and put you to bed. The rascals won't let us sit in peace after
dinner,</q> he snapped peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew
at his word.
</p>

<p>
<q>Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It's
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>
you he's so interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?</q>
he added to Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing whatever,</q> answered Ivan. <q>He's pleased to have a
high opinion of me; he's a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material
for revolution, however, when the time comes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For revolution?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There will be others and better ones. But there will be some
like him as well. His kind will come first, and better ones after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when will the time come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants
are not very fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, brother, but a Balaam's ass like that thinks and thinks, and
the devil knows where he gets to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's storing up ideas,</q> said Ivan, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, I know he can't bear me, nor any one else, even you,
though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still
with Alyosha, he despises Alyosha. But he doesn't steal, that's one
thing, and he's not a gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn't wash
our dirty linen in public. He makes capital fish pasties too. But,
damn him, is he worth talking about so much?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course he isn't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant,
generally speaking, needs thrashing. That I've always maintained.
Our peasants are swindlers, and don't deserve to be pitied, and it's
a good thing they're still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in
birches. If they destroyed the forests, it would be the ruin of Russia.
I stand up for the clever people. We've left off thrashing the
peasants, we've grown so clever, but they go on thrashing themselves.
And a good thing too. <q>For with what measure ye mete
it shall be measured to you again,</q> or how does it go? Anyhow, it
will be measured. But Russia's all swinishness. My dear, if you
only knew how I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this
vice! But maybe I mean Russia. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Tout
cela c'est de la cochonnerie</foreign>....
Do you know what I like? I like wit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've had another glass. That's enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a bit. I'll have one more, and then another, and then I'll
stop. No, stay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to
an old man, and he told me: <q>There's nothing we like so much as
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>
sentencing girls to be thrashed, and we always give the lads the job
of thrashing them. And the girl he has thrashed to-day, the young
man will ask in marriage to-morrow. So it quite suits the girls,
too,</q> he said. There's a set of de Sades for you! But it's clever,
anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh? Alyosha, are
you blushing? Don't be bashful, child. I'm sorry I didn't stay to
dinner at the Superior's and tell the monks about the girls at
Mokroe. Alyosha, don't be angry that I offended your Superior this
morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then,
of course, I'm to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if
there isn't a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It's
not enough to cut their heads off, for they keep back progress.
Would you believe it, Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No,
you don't believe it as I see from your eyes. You believe what people
say, that I'm nothing but a buffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that
I'm nothing but a buffoon?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I believe you don't, and that you speak the truth. You
look sincere and you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan's supercilious....
I'd make an end of your monks, though, all the same.
I'd take all that mystic stuff and suppress it, once for all, all over
Russia, so as to bring all the fools to reason. And the gold and the
silver that would flow into the mint!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why suppress it?</q> asked Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>That Truth may prevail. That's why.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you'd be the first to
be robbed and suppressed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! I dare say you're right. Ah, I'm an ass!</q> burst out Fyodor
Pavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. <q>Well, your
monastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that's how it is. And we
clever people will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan,
it must have been so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan,
speak, is there a God or not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously.
Why are you laughing again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm laughing that you should have made a clever remark just
now about Smerdyakov's belief in the existence of two saints who
could move mountains.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, am I like him now, then?</q>
</p>

<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>

<p>
<q>Very much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that shows I'm a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.
And you may be caught in the same way, though you
are a philosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I'll
catch you to-morrow. Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not?
Only, be serious. I want you to be serious now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there is no God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, is there a God?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a
tiny bit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no immortality either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None at all?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?
Anything is better than nothing!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Absolute nothingness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, is there immortality?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God and immortality?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God and immortality. In God is immortality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>H'm! It's more likely Ivan's right. Good Lord! to think what
faith, what force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that
dream, and for how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at
man? Ivan! For the last time, once for all, is there a God or not?
I ask for the last time!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And for the last time there is not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be the devil,</q> said Ivan, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the devil? Does he exist?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there's no devil either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn't I do to the man who
first invented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too
good for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There would have been no civilization if they hadn't invented
God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wouldn't there have been? Without God?</q>
</p>

<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>

<p>
<q>No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must
take your brandy away from you, anyway.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I've hurt
Alyosha's feelings. You're not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear
little Alexey!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better
than your head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that
from you. Ivan, do you love Alyosha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You must love him</q> (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very
drunk). <q>Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning.
But I was excited. But there's wit in that elder, don't you think,
Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very likely.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is, there is. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Il y a du Piron
là-dedans.</foreign> He's a Jesuit, a
Russian one, that is. As he's an honorable person there's a hidden
indignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, of course, he believes in God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bit of it. Didn't you know? Why, he tells every one
so, himself. That is, not every one, but all the clever people who
come to him. He said straight out to Governor Schultz not long
ago: <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Credo</foreign>, but I don't know in
what.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He really did. But I respect him. There's something of
Mephistopheles about him, or rather of <q>The hero of our time</q> ...
Arbenin, or what's his name?... You see, he's a sensualist. He's
such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my
wife if she went to confess to him. You know, when he begins telling
stories.... The year before last he invited us to tea, tea with
liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began telling us about
old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially how he once
cured a paralyzed woman. <q>If my legs were not bad I know a
dance I could dance you,</q> he said. What do you say to that? <q>I've
plenty of tricks in my time,</q> said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant,
out of sixty thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, he stole it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>

<p>
<q>He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying,
<q>Take care of it for me, friend, there'll be a police search at my
place to-morrow.</q> And he kept it. <q>You have given it to the
Church,</q> he declared. I said to him: <q>You're a scoundrel,</q> I said.
<q>No,</q> said he, <q>I'm not a scoundrel, but I'm broad-minded.</q> But that
wasn't he, that was some one else. I've muddled him with some
one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass and that's
enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I've been telling lies. Why
didn't you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I knew you'd stop of yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me.
You despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own
house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I'm going away. You've had too much brandy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've begged you for Christ's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a
day or two, and you don't go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll go to-morrow if you're so set upon it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't go. You want to keep an eye on me. That's what
you want, spiteful fellow. That's why you won't go.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness
when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to
pick a quarrel and to assert himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that?
Your eyes look at me and say, <q>You ugly drunkard!</q> Your eyes
are mistrustful. They're contemptuous.... You've come here
with some design. Alyosha, here, looks at me and his eyes shine.
Alyosha doesn't despise me. Alexey, you mustn't love Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking
him,</q> Alyosha said emphatically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy,
Ivan. It's the third time I've told you.</q>
</p>

<p>
He mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his
face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don't
love me, but don't be angry all the same. You've nothing to love
me for. You go to Tchermashnya. I'll come to you myself and
bring you a present. I'll show you a little wench there. I've had
my eye on her a long time. She's still running about bare-foot.
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
Don't be afraid of bare-footed wenches&mdash;don't despise them&mdash;they're
pearls!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he kissed his hand with a smack.
</p>

<p>
<q>To my thinking,</q> he revived at once, seeming to grow sober
the instant he touched on his favorite topic. <q>To my thinking ...
Ah, you boys! You children, little sucking-pigs, to my
thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life&mdash;that's
been my rule! Can you understand that? How could you understand
it? You've milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of
your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something
devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find
in any other. Only, one must know how to find it, that's the point!
That's a talent! To my mind there are no ugly women. The very
fact that she is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you
understand that? Even in <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>vieilles
filles</foreign>, even in them you may discover
something that makes you simply wonder that men have been
such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them. Bare-footed
girls or unattractive ones, you must take by surprise. Didn't
you know that? You must astound them till they're fascinated,
upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a
little slut. It's a jolly good thing that there always are and will
be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little
maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that's all that's
needed for happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to
surprise your mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention
to her at all, but all at once, when the minute came, I'd be all devotion
to her, crawl on my knees, kiss her feet, and I always, always&mdash;I
remember it as though it were to-day&mdash;reduced her to that
tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh. It was peculiar to her.
I knew her attacks always used to begin like that. The next day
she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh was not
a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That's
the great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky&mdash;he
was a handsome fellow, and rich&mdash;used to like to come here
and hang about her&mdash;suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her
presence. And she&mdash;such a mild sheep&mdash;why, I thought she would
have knocked me down for that blow. How she set on me! <q>You're
beaten, beaten now,</q> she said. <q>You've taken a blow from him.
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
You have been trying to sell me to him,</q> she said.... <q>And how
dared he strike you in my presence! Don't dare come near me
again, never, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!</q>...
I took her to the monastery then to bring her to her senses. The
holy Fathers prayed her back to reason. But I swear, by God,
Alyosha, I never insulted the poor crazy girl! Only once, perhaps,
in the first year; then she was very fond of praying. She used to
keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn me out
of her room then. I'll knock that mysticism out of her, thought I!
<q>Here,</q> said I, <q>you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it
down. You believe it's miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it directly
and nothing will happen to me for it!</q>... When she saw it, good
Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung
her hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all
over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha,
what's the matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun
speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over
Alyosha's face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips
quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing,
till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha.
Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly
repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his
mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in
them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical
paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance
to his mother particularly impressed the old man.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her, exactly as she used
to be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth,
that's what I used to do to her. He's upset about his mother, his
mother,</q> he muttered to Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she
not?</q> said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old
man shrank before his flashing eyes. But something very strange
had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have
escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's mother actually was the
mother of Ivan too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your mother?</q> he muttered, not understanding. <q>What do
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>
you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?...
Why, damn it! of course she was yours too! Damn it! My mind
has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why, I was thinking,
Ivan.... He he he!</q> He stopped. A broad, drunken, half-senseless
grin overspread his face.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the
hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri
burst into the room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Don't let him get at me!</q> he
screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan's coat.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter IX. The Sensualists</head>

<p>
Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri.
They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing
to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch
some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri
stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory
ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of
the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the
closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance,
so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,
Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then she's there! She's hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him
back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory
with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping
over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling
at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's here!</q> shouted Dmitri. <q>I saw her turn towards the house
just now, but I couldn't catch her. Where is she? Where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
That shout, <q>She's here!</q> produced an indescribable effect on
Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.
</p>

<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>

<p>
<q>Hold him! Hold him!</q> he cried, and dashed after Dmitri.
Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed
stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third
room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash:
it was a large glass vase&mdash;not an expensive one&mdash;on a marble pedestal
which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.
</p>

<p>
<q>At him!</q> shouted the old man. <q>Help!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing
him back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright,</q> Ivan
cried wrathfully at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He
said he saw her himself, running.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time,
and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.
He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come,</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>But she may have come by that other entrance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of
course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was
in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket. The windows of all the rooms
were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor
have run out anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold him!</q> shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him
again. <q>He's been stealing money in my bedroom.</q> And tearing
himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up
both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts
of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung
him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times
with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan,
though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and
with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his
slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madman! You've killed him!</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Serve him right!</q> shouted Dmitri breathlessly. <q>If I haven't
killed him, I'll come again and kill him. You can't protect him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri! Go away at once!</q> cried Alyosha commandingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here
just now, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence
from the lane. I shouted, she ran away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I saw her.... So she must ... I'll find out at once
where she is.... Good-by, Alexey! Not a word to Æsop about
the money now. But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure
to say, <q>He sends his compliments to you!</q> Compliments, his compliments!
Just compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated
him in an arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was
conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still
fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri
looked at him with hatred as he went out.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't repent shedding your blood!</q> he cried. <q>Beware, old
man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you,
and disown you altogether.</q>
</p>

<p>
He ran out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!</q> the
old man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his
finger.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she's not here, you old lunatic!</q> Ivan shouted at him angrily.
<q>Here, he's fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed,
and put him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his
head. Exhausted by the brandy, by his violent emotion, and the
blows he had received, he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his
head touched the pillow. Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room.
Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase,
while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed,
too?</q> Alyosha said to him. <q>We'll look after him. My brother
gave you a terrible blow&mdash;on the head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's insulted me!</q> Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's <q>insulted</q> his father, not only you,</q> observed Ivan with a
forced smile.
</p>

<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>

<p>
<q>I used to wash him in his tub. He's insulted me,</q> repeated
Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him away perhaps he'd have
murdered him. It wouldn't take much to do for Æsop, would it?</q>
whispered Ivan to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>God forbid!</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should He forbid?</q> Ivan went on in the same whisper, with
a malignant grimace. <q>One reptile will devour the other. And
serve them both right, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha shuddered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I won't let him be murdered as I didn't just now.
Stay here, Alyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard. My head's begun
to ache.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went to his father's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind
the screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened
his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering
and meditating. All at once his face betrayed extraordinary
excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> he whispered apprehensively, <q>where's Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood
on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his
nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead
there was a rather large crimson bruise.
</p>

<p>
<q>What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm
afraid of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're
the only one I'm not afraid of....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My
angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She won't marry him.</q>
