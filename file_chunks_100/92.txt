<pb n='516'/><anchor id='Pg516'/>
beginning, but Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him,
addressed Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory
Vassilyevitch. He is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the terrible
blows inflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by
you, there seems no doubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at
least.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alive? He's alive?</q> cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His
face beamed. <q>Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought
for me, a sinner and evildoer. That's an answer to my prayer.
I've been praying all night.</q> And he crossed himself three times.
He was almost breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence
concerning you, that&mdash;</q> The prosecutor would have continued,
but Mitya suddenly jumped up from his chair.
</p>

<p>
<q>One minute, gentlemen, for God's sake, one minute; I will run
to her&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, at this moment it's quite impossible,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
almost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was
seized by the men with the metal plates, but he sat down of his
own accord....
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute
only; I wanted to tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone,
that blood that was weighing on my heart all night, and that I am
not a murderer now! Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!</q> he said
ecstatically and reverently, looking round at them all. <q>Oh, thank
you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute you have given me new life,
new heart!... That old man used to carry me in his arms, gentlemen.
He used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three years
old, abandoned by every one, he was like a father to me!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And so you&mdash;</q> the investigating lawyer began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,</q> interposed
Mitya, putting his elbows on the table and covering his face with
his hands. <q>Let me have a moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen.
All this is horribly upsetting, horribly. A man is not a
drum, gentlemen!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Drink a little more water,</q> murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were
<pb n='517'/><anchor id='Pg517'/>
confident. He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His
whole bearing was changed; he was once more the equal of these
men, with all of whom he was acquainted, as though they had all
met the day before, when nothing had happened, at some social
gathering. We may note in passing that, on his first arrival, Mitya
had been made very welcome at the police captain's, but later, during
the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called at all, and when
the police captain met him, in the street, for instance, Mitya noticed
that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His acquaintance
with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes paid
his wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without
quite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had,
for some reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had not
had time to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had
met him and talked to him twice, each time about the fair sex.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,</q> cried
Mitya, laughing gayly, <q>but I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen,
I feel like a new man, and don't be offended at my addressing you so
simply and directly. I'm rather drunk, too, I'll tell you that frankly.
I believe I've had the honor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay
Parfenovitch, at my kinsman Mi√ºsov's. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I
don't pretend to be on equal terms with you. I understand, of
course, in what character I am sitting before you. Oh, of course,
there's a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... if Grigory
has given evidence.... A horrible suspicion! It's awful, awful, I
understand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we
will make an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen!
Since I know I'm innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute.
Can't we? Can't we?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though
he positively took his listeners to be his best friends.
</p>

<p>
<q>So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the
charge brought against you,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively,
and bending down to the secretary he dictated to him in an
undertone what to write.
</p>

<p>
<q>Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it;
I consent, I give my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay,
stay, write this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of
<pb n='518'/><anchor id='Pg518'/>
violence on a poor old man I am guilty. And there is something
else at the bottom of my heart, of which I am guilty, too&mdash;but that
you need not write down</q> (he turned suddenly to the secretary);
<q>that's my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn't concern you, the
bottom of my heart, that's to say.... But of the murder of my
old father I'm not guilty. That's a wild idea. It's quite a wild
idea!... I will prove you that and you'll be convinced directly....
You will laugh, gentlemen. You'll laugh yourselves at your
suspicion!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> said the investigating lawyer
evidently trying to allay Mitya's excitement by his own composure.
<q>Before we go on with our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent
to answer, to hear you confirm the statement that you disliked
your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, that you were involved in continual
disputes with him. Here at least, a quarter of an hour ago,
you exclaimed that you wanted to kill him: <q>I didn't kill him,</q> you
said, <q>but I wanted to kill him.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily,
I did want to kill him ... many times I wanted to ...
unhappily, unhappily!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives
precisely led you to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is there to explain, gentlemen?</q> Mitya shrugged his
shoulders sullenly, looking down. <q>I have never concealed my
feelings. All the town knows about it&mdash;every one knows in the
tavern. Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima's cell....
And the very same day, in the evening I beat my father. I nearly
killed him, and I swore I'd come again and kill him, before witnesses....
Oh, a thousand witnesses! I've been shouting it aloud
for the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares
you in the face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings,
gentlemen, feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen</q>&mdash;Mitya
frowned&mdash;<q>it seems to me that about feelings you've no
right to question me. I know that you are bound by your office, I
quite understand that, but that's my affair, my private, intimate
affair, yet ... since I haven't concealed my feelings in the past ...
in the tavern, for instance, I've talked to every one, so ...
so I won't make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,
<pb n='519'/><anchor id='Pg519'/>
that there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told
every one that I'd kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he's been killed.
So it must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you,
gentlemen, I can quite make allowances. I'm struck all of a heap
myself, for who can have murdered him, if not I? That's what it
comes to, isn't it? If not I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I
want to know, I insist on knowing!</q> he exclaimed suddenly. <q>Where
was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, and with what?
Tell me,</q> he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.
</p>

<p>
<q>We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with
his head battered in,</q> said the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's horrible!</q> Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on
the table, hid his face in his right hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>We will continue,</q> interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. <q>So what
was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have
asserted in public, I believe, that it was based upon jealousy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Disputes about money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, about money, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which
you claimed as part of your inheritance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand! More, more,</q> cried Mitya hotly; <q>more than
six thousand, more than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it
at them. But I made up my mind to let it go at three thousand.
I was desperately in need of that three thousand ... so the bundle
of notes for three thousand that I knew he kept under his pillow,
ready for Grushenka, I considered as simply stolen from me. Yes,
gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my own property....</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer,
and had time to wink at him on the sly.
</p>

<p>
<q>We will return to that subject later,</q> said the lawyer promptly.
<q>You will allow us to note that point and write it down; that you
looked upon that money as your own property?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Write it down, by all means. I know that's another fact that
tells against me, but I'm not afraid of facts and I tell them against
myself. Do you hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for
a different sort of man from what I am,</q> he added, suddenly gloomy
and dejected. <q>You have to deal with a man of honor, a man of
<pb n='520'/><anchor id='Pg520'/>
the highest honor; above all&mdash;don't lose sight of it&mdash;a man who's
done a lot of nasty things, but has always been, and still is, honorable
at bottom, in his inner being. I don't know how to express it.
That's just what's made me wretched all my life, that I yearned to
be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense of honor,
seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, and yet
all my life I've been doing filthy things like all of us, gentlemen ...
that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me
alone!... Gentlemen, my head aches ...</q> His brows contracted
with pain. <q>You see, gentlemen, I couldn't bear the look
of him, there was something in him ignoble, impudent, trampling on
everything sacred, something sneering and irreverent, loathsome,
loathsome. But now that he's dead, I feel differently.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't feel differently, but I wish I hadn't hated him so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You feel penitent?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not penitent, don't write that. I'm not much good myself,
I'm not very beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive.
That's what I mean. Write that down, if you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more
and more gloomy as the inquiry continued.
</p>

<p>
At that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though
Grushenka had been removed, she had not been taken far away,
only into the room next but one from the blue room, in which the
examination was proceeding. It was a little room with one window,
next beyond the large room in which they had danced and feasted
so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by her but Maximov,
who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her
side, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants
with a metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly
her grief was too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her
arms and, with a loud wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to
him, to her Mitya, and so unexpectedly that they had not time
to stop her. Mitya, hearing her cry, trembled, jumped up, and
with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her, not knowing what he
was doing. But they were not allowed to come together, though
they saw one another. He was seized by the arms. He struggled,
and tried to tear himself away. It took three or four men to hold
<pb n='521'/><anchor id='Pg521'/>
him. She was seized too, and he saw her stretching out her arms
to him, crying aloud as they carried her away. When the scene
was over, he came to himself again, sitting in the same place as
before, opposite the investigating lawyer, and crying out to them:
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want with her? Why do you torment her? She's
done nothing, nothing!...</q>
</p>

<p>
The lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like
this. At last Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly
into the room, and said in a loud and excited voice to the
prosecutor:
</p>

<p>
<q>She's been removed, she's downstairs. Will you allow me to say
one word to this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen,
in your presence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,</q> answered the investigating
lawyer. <q>In the present case we have nothing against it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,</q> began the police
captain, and there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for
the luckless prisoner on his excited face. <q>I took your Agrafena
Alexandrovna downstairs myself, and confided her to the care of
the landlord's daughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her
all the time. And I soothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed
her. I impressed on her that you have to clear yourself, so she
mustn't hinder you, must not depress you, or you may lose your
head and say the wrong thing in your evidence. In fact, I talked to
her and she understood. She's a sensible girl, my boy, a good-hearted
girl, she would have kissed my old hands, begging help for
you. She sent me herself, to tell you not to worry about her. And
I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her that you are calm
and comforted about her. And so you must be calm, do you understand?
I was unfair to her; she is a Christian soul, gentlemen,
yes, I tell you, she's a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything. So
what am I to tell her, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet
or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
The good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular,
but Grushenka's suffering, a fellow creature's suffering, touched
his good-natured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped
up and rushed towards him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!</q> he cried.
<pb n='522'/><anchor id='Pg522'/>
<q>You've the heart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank
you for her. I will, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in
the kindness of your heart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that
I shall be laughing in a minute, knowing that she has a guardian
angel like you. I shall have done with all this directly, and as soon
as I'm free, I'll be with her, she'll see, let her wait. Gentlemen,</q> he
said, turning to the two lawyers, <q>now I'll open my whole soul to
you; I'll pour out everything. We'll finish this off directly, finish
it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end, shan't we? But, gentlemen,
that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me tell you
that. That one thing I'll tell you now.... I see I'm with honorable
men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you
knew! Did you hear her cry, <q>I'll go to death with you</q>? And
what have I, a penniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for
me? How can a clumsy, ugly brute like me, with my ugly face,
deserve such love, that she is ready to go to exile with me? And
how she fell down at your feet for my sake, just now!... and
yet she's proud and has done nothing! How can I help adoring her,
how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I did just now?
Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his
hands, burst into tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered
himself instantly. The old police captain seemed much pleased,
and the lawyers also. They felt that the examination was passing
into a new phase. When the police captain went out, Mitya was
positively gay.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal.
And if it were not for all these trivial details, we should understand
one another in a minute. I'm at those details again. I'm at
your disposal, gentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual
confidence, you in me and I in you, or there'll be no end to it. I
speak in your interests. To business, gentlemen, to business, and
don't rummage in my soul; don't tease me with trifles, but only ask
me about facts and what matters, and I will satisfy you at once.
And damn the details!</q>
</p>

<p>
So spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again.

<head>Chapter IV. The Second Ordeal</head>

<p>
<q>You don't know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
by your readiness to answer,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch,
with an animated air, and obvious satisfaction beaming in his very
prominent, short-sighted, light gray eyes, from which he had removed
his spectacles a moment before. <q>And you have made a
very just remark about the mutual confidence, without which it is
sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such importance,
if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend himself and
is in a position to do so. We, on our side, will do everything
in our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting
the case. You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?</q> He turned to the
prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, undoubtedly,</q> replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat
cold, compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch's impulsiveness.
</p>

<p>
I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but
lately arrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect
for Ippolit Kirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his
bosom friend. He was almost the only person who put implicit
faith in Ippolit Kirillovitch's extraordinary talents as a psychologist
and orator and in the justice of his grievance. He had heard of him
in Petersburg. On the other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch
was the only person in the whole world whom our <q>unappreciated</q>
prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way to Mokroe they had
time to come to an understanding about the present case. And now
as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and interpreted
every indication on his senior colleague's face&mdash;half a word,
a glance, or a wink.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don't interrupt
me with trivial questions and I'll tell you everything in a moment,</q>
said Mitya excitedly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your
communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little
fact of great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed
<pb n='524'/><anchor id='Pg524'/>
yesterday at about five o'clock on the security of your pistols, from
your friend, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles.
What more? That's all about it. As soon as I got back to town I
pledged them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn't
you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic
description of all you did yesterday, from the morning
onwards? Allow us, for instance, to inquire why you were absent
from the town, and just when you left and when you came back&mdash;all
those facts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You should have asked me like that from the beginning,</q> cried
Mitya, laughing aloud, <q>and, if you like, we won't begin from yesterday,
but from the morning of the day before; then you'll understand
how, why, and where I went. I went the day before yesterday,
gentlemen, to a merchant of the town, called Samsonov, to
borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security. It was
a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to interrupt you,</q> the prosecutor put in politely.
<q>Why were you in such pressing need for just that sum, three
thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, gentlemen, you needn't go into details, how, when and why,
and why just so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole.
Why, it'll run to three volumes, and then you'll want an
epilogue!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity
of a man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full
of the best intentions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen!</q>&mdash;he corrected himself hurriedly&mdash;<q>don't be vexed
with me for my restiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more,
I feel the greatest respect for you and understand the true position
of affairs. Don't think I'm drunk. I'm quite sober now. And,
besides, being drunk would be no hindrance. It's with me, you
know, like the saying: <q>When he is sober, he is a fool; when he is
drunk, he is a wise man.</q> Ha ha! But I see, gentlemen, it's not the
<pb n='525'/><anchor id='Pg525'/>
proper thing to make jokes to you, till we've had our explanation, I
mean. And I've my own dignity to keep up, too. I quite understand
the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position
of a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And
it's your business to watch me. I can't expect you to pat me on the
head for what I did to Grigory, for one can't break old men's heads
with impunity. I suppose you'll put me away for him for six
months, or a year perhaps, in a house of correction. I don't know
what the punishment is&mdash;but it will be without loss of the rights
of my rank, without loss of my rank, won't it? So you see, gentlemen,
I understand the distinction between us.... But you
must see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions.
<q>How did you step? Where did you step? When did you step?
And on what did you step?</q> I shall get mixed up, if you go on like
this, and you will put it all down against me. And what will that
lead to? To nothing! And even if it's nonsense I'm talking now,
let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being men of honor and refinement,
will forgive me! I'll finish by asking you, gentlemen, to
drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean, beginning
from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for breakfast,
how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention of
the criminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question,
<q>Whom did you murder? Whom did you rob?</q> Ha ha! That's
your regulation method, that's where all your cunning comes in.
You can put peasants off their guard like that, but not me. I know
the tricks. I've been in the service, too. Ha ha ha! You're not
angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence?</q> he cried, looking
at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising. <q>It's
only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would
be inexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya.
Ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the
prosecutor did not laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya,
as though anxious not to miss the least syllable, the slightest movement,
the smallest twitch of any feature of his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's how we have treated you from the beginning,</q> said
Nikolay Parfenovitch, still laughing. <q>We haven't tried to put you
out by asking how you got up in the morning and what you had for
<pb n='526'/><anchor id='Pg526'/>
breakfast. We began, indeed, with questions of the greatest
importance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still
more your present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness,
worthy of your noble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let
everything be on the footing of mutual confidence between educated,
well-bred people, who have the common bond of noble birth
and honor. In any case, allow me to look upon you as my best
friends at this moment of my life, at this moment when my honor
is assailed. That's no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the contrary. You've expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation.
</p>

<p>
<q>And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those
tricky questions!</q> cried Mitya enthusiastically. <q>Or there's simply
no knowing where we shall get to! Is there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will follow your sensible advice entirely,</q> the prosecutor interposed,
addressing Mitya. <q>I don't withdraw my question, however.
It is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you
needed that sum, I mean precisely three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another....
Well, it was to pay a debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A debt to whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I
couldn't, or because I shouldn't dare, or because it would be damaging,
for it's all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling, but&mdash;I won't,
because it's a matter of principle: that's my private life, and I won't
allow any intrusion into my private life. That's my principle. Your
question has no bearing on the case, and whatever has nothing to do
with the case is my private affair. I wanted to pay a debt. I wanted
to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won't say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to make a note of that,</q> said the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means. Write down that I won't say, that I won't.
Write that I should think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can
write it; you've nothing else to do with your time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if
you are unaware of it,</q> the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and
stern impressiveness, <q>that you have a perfect right not to answer
<pb n='527'/><anchor id='Pg527'/>
the questions put to you now, and we on our side have no right to
extort an answer from you, if you decline to give it for one reason
or another. That is entirely a matter for your personal decision.
But it is our duty, on the other hand, in such cases as the present, to
explain and set before you the degree of injury you will be doing
yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of evidence. After
which I will beg you to continue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, I'm not angry ... I ...</q> Mitya muttered in a
rather disconcerted tone. <q>Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov
to whom I went then ...</q>
</p>

<p>
We will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known
to the reader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit
the slightest detail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it
over. But as he gave his evidence it was written down, and therefore
they had continually to pull him up. Mitya disliked this, but
submitted; got angry, though still good-humoredly. He did, it is
true, exclaim, from time to time, <q>Gentlemen, that's enough to
make an angel out of patience!</q> Or, <q>Gentlemen, it's no good
your irritating me.</q>
</p>

<p>
But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his
genially expansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made
a fool of him two days before. (He had completely realized by now
that he had been fooled.) The sale of his watch for six roubles
to obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers.
They were at once greatly interested, and even, to Mitya's intense
indignation, thought it necessary to write the fact down as a secondary
confirmation of the circumstance that he had hardly a farthing
in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya began to grow
surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, the night
spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return to the
town. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to give a
minute account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka's
account.
</p>

<p>
He was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly
into the circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya
Kondratyevna's house at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden to
keep watch on Grushenka, and of Smerdyakov's bringing him information.
They laid particular stress on this, and noted it down.
<pb n='528'/><anchor id='Pg528'/>
Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length, and though inwardly
ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to <q>public ignominy,</q>
so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in order to
tell the truth. The frigid severity, with which the investigating
lawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he
told his story, disconcerted him at last considerably.
</p>

<p>
<q>That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense
about women only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are
not worth my telling this to,</q> he reflected mournfully. <q>It's ignominious.
<q>Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.</q></q> He wound up his
reflections with that line. But he pulled himself together to go on
again. When he came to telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov,
he regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that
lady which had nothing to do with the case. But the investigating
lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he should pass on to
<q>more essential matters.</q> At last, when he described his despair and
told them how, when he left Madame Hohlakov's, he thought that
he'd <q>get three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it,</q>
they stopped him again and noted down that he had <q>meant to
murder some one.</q> Mitya let them write it without protest. At
last he reached the point in his story when he learned that Grushenka
had deceived him and had returned from Samsonov's as soon as he
left her there, though she had said that she would stay there till
midnight.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I didn't kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I
hadn't time,</q> broke from him suddenly at that point in his story.
That, too, was carefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and
was beginning to tell how he ran into his father's garden when the
investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him, and opening the big
portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass
pestle.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you recognize this object?</q> he asked, showing it to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes,</q> he laughed gloomily. <q>Of course I recognize it. Let
me have a look at it.... Damn it, never mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have forgotten to mention it,</q> observed the investigating
lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hang it all, I shouldn't have concealed it from you. Do you
<pb n='529'/><anchor id='Pg529'/>
suppose I could have managed without it? It simply escaped my
memory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself
with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.
</p>

<p>
<q>But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such
a weapon?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What for, if you had no object?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya's wrath flared up. He looked intently at <q>the boy</q> and
smiled gloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more
ashamed at having told <q>such people</q> the story of his jealousy so
sincerely and spontaneously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bother the pestle!</q> broke from him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But still&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In
case anything turned up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with
you when you went out, since you're afraid of the dark?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ugh! damn it all, gentlemen! There's positively no talking to
you!</q> cried Mitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to
the secretary, crimson with anger, he said quickly, with a note of
fury in his voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Write down at once ... at once ... <q>that I snatched up the
pestle to go and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by
hitting him on the head with it!</q> Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen?
Are your minds relieved?</q> he said, glaring defiantly at the
lawyers.
</p>

<p>
<q>We quite understand that you made that statement just now
through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you,
which you consider trivial, though they are, in fact, essential,</q> the
prosecutor remarked dryly in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle....
What does one pick things up for at such moments? I don't know
what for. I snatched it up and ran&mdash;that's all. For to me, gentlemen,
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>passons</foreign>, or I declare
I won't tell you any more.</q>
</p>

<pb n='530'/><anchor id='Pg530'/>

<p>
He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He
sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a
feeling of nausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up
and declare that he wouldn't say another word, <q>not if you hang
me for it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, gentlemen,</q> he said at last, with difficulty controlling
himself, <q>you see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream....
It's a dream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it&mdash;it's
always the same ... that some one is hunting me, some one
I'm awfully afraid of ... that he's hunting me in the dark, in the
night ... tracking me, and I hide somewhere from him, behind a
door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way, and the worst of it is, he
always knows where I am, but he pretends not to know where I am
on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror.... That's
just what you're doing now. It's just like that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that the sort of thing you dream about?</q> inquired the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is. Don't you want to write it down?</q> said Mitya, with
a distorted smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>No; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious
dreams.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not a question of dreams now, gentlemen&mdash;this is realism,
this is real life! I'm a wolf and you're the hunters. Well, hunt
him down!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are wrong to make such comparisons ...</q> began Nikolay
Parfenovitch, with extraordinary softness.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I'm not wrong, not at all!</q> Mitya flared up again, though
his outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew
more good-humored at every word. <q rend='pre'>You may not trust a criminal
or a man on trial tortured by your questions, but an honorable man,
the honorable impulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)&mdash;no! That
you must believe you have no right indeed ... but&mdash;</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Be silent, heart,</l>
<l>Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>Well, shall I go on?</q> he broke off gloomily.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you'll be so kind,</q> answered Nikolay Parfenovitch.

<head>Chapter V. The Third Ordeal</head>

<p>
Though Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying
more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his
story. He told them how he had leapt over the fence into his
father's garden; how he had gone up to the window; told them
all that had passed under the window. Clearly, precisely, distinctly,
he described the feelings that troubled him during those moments
in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka
was with his father or not. But, strange to say, both the
lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at
him, asked few questions. Mitya could gather nothing from their
faces.
</p>

<p>
<q>They're angry and offended,</q> he thought. <q>Well, bother them!</q>
</p>

<p>
When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the
<q>signal</q> to his father that Grushenka had come, so that he should
open the window, the lawyers paid no attention to the word <q>signal,</q>
as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the
word in this connection: so much so, that Mitya noticed it. Coming
at last to the moment when, seeing his father peering out of the
window, his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of his
pocket, he suddenly, as though of design, stopped short. He sat
gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q> said the investigating lawyer. <q>You pulled out the
weapon and ... and what happened then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then? Why, then I murdered him ... hit him on the head
and cracked his skull.... I suppose that's your story. That's it!</q>
</p>

<p>
His eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly
flamed up with extraordinary violence in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Our story?</q> repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. <q>Well&mdash;and
yours?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>My story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,</q> he began softly.
<q>Whether it was some one's tears, or my mother prayed to God, or
<pb n='532'/><anchor id='Pg532'/>
a good angel kissed me at that instant, I don't know. But the devil
was conquered. I rushed from the window and ran to the fence.
My father was alarmed and, for the first time, he saw me then,
cried out, and sprang back from the window. I remember that
very well. I ran across the garden to the fence ... and there
Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on the fence.</q>
</p>

<p>
At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners.
They seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention.
A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya's soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you're laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!</q> he
broke off suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What makes you think that?</q> observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't believe one word&mdash;that's why! I understand, of
course, that I have come to the vital point. The old man's lying
there now with his skull broken, while I&mdash;after dramatically describing
how I wanted to kill him, and how I snatched up the pestle&mdash;I
suddenly run away from the window. A romance! Poetry!
As though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha! You are
scoffers, gentlemen!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you notice,</q> asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though
not observing Mitya's excitement, <q>did you notice when you ran
away from the window, whether the door into the garden was
open?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it was not open.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a
bit!</q> he seemed suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a
start:
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, did you find the door open?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it was open.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?</q>
cried Mitya, greatly astonished.
</p>

<p>
<q>The door stood open, and your father's murderer undoubtedly
went in at that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out
again by the same door,</q> the prosecutor pronounced deliberately,
as though chiseling out each word separately. <q>That is perfectly
clear. The murder was committed in the room and <emph>not through the
<pb n='533'/><anchor id='Pg533'/>
window</emph>; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has
been made, from the position of the body and everything. There
can be no doubt of that circumstance.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded.
</p>

<p>
<q>But that's utterly impossible!</q> he cried, completely at a loss.
<q>I ... I didn't go in.... I tell you positively, definitely, the
door was shut the whole time I was in the garden, and when I ran
out of the garden. I only stood at the window and saw him
through the window. That's all, that's all.... I remember to the
last minute. And if I didn't remember, it would be just the same.
I know it, for no one knew the signals except Smerdyakov, and me,
and the dead man. And he wouldn't have opened the door to any
one in the world without the signals.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Signals? What signals?</q> asked the prosecutor, with greedy,
almost hysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his reserve
and dignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity.
He scented an important fact of which he had known nothing, and
was already filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to
disclose it.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you didn't know!</q> Mitya winked at him with a malicious
and mocking smile. <q>What if I won't tell you? From whom could
you find out? No one knew about the signals except my father,
Smerdyakov, and me: that was all. Heaven knew, too, but it won't
tell you. But it's an interesting fact. There's no knowing what you
might build on it. Ha ha! Take comfort, gentlemen, I'll reveal
it. You've some foolish idea in your hearts. You don't know the
man you have to deal with! You have to do with a prisoner who
gives evidence against himself, to his own damage! Yes, for I'm a
man of honor and you&mdash;are not.</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling
with impatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely
Mitya told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor
Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov. He told them exactly what every tap
on the window meant, tapped the signals on the table, and when
Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed he, Mitya, had tapped
the signal <q>Grushenka has come,</q> when he tapped to his father,
he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal, that <q>Grushenka
had come.</q>
</p>

<pb n='534'/><anchor id='Pg534'/>

<p>
<q>So now you can build up your tower,</q> Mitya broke off, and
again turned away from them contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and
the valet Smerdyakov? And no one else?</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
inquired once more.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about
Heaven. That may be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
And they had already, of course, begun writing it down. But
while they wrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching
on a new idea:
</p>

<p>
<q>But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely
deny all responsibility for the death of your father, was it
not he, perhaps, who knocked the signal agreed upon, induced your
father to open to him, and then ... committed the crime?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense
hatred. His silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor
blink.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've caught the fox again,</q> commented Mitya at last; <q>you've
got the beast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor.
You thought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at
your prompting, and shout with all my might, <q>Aie! it's Smerdyakov;
he's the murderer.</q> Confess that's what you thought. Confess,
and I'll go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and
waited.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're mistaken. I'm not going to shout <q>It's Smerdyakov,</q></q>
said Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you don't even suspect him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, do you suspect him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is suspected, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Joking apart,</q> he brought out gloomily. <q>Listen. From the
very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you
from behind the curtain, I've had the thought of Smerdyakov in
my mind. I've been sitting here, shouting that I'm innocent and
thinking all the time <q>Smerdyakov!</q> I can't get Smerdyakov out
of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now;
<pb n='535'/><anchor id='Pg535'/>
but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, <q>No, it's not
Smerdyakov.</q> It's not his doing, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that case is there anybody else you suspect?</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
inquired cautiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know any one it could be, whether it's the hand of
Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,</q> Mitya jerked out
with decision.
</p>

<p>
<q>But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that
it's not he?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From my conviction&mdash;my impression. Because Smerdyakov is
a man of the most abject character and a coward. He's not a
coward, he's the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking
on two legs. He has the heart of a chicken. When he talked to
me, he was always trembling for fear I should kill him, though I
never raised my hand against him. He fell at my feet and blubbered;
he has kissed these very boots, literally, beseeching me <q>not to
frighten him.</q> Do you hear? <q>Not to frighten him.</q> What a
thing to say! Why, I offered him money. He's a puling chicken&mdash;sickly,
epileptic, weak-minded&mdash;a child of eight could thrash
him. He has no character worth talking about. It's not Smerdyakov,
gentlemen. He doesn't care for money; he wouldn't take my
presents. Besides, what motive had he for murdering the old man?
Why, he's very likely his son, you know&mdash;his natural son. Do you
know that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We have heard that legend. But you are your father's son, too,
you know; yet you yourself told every one you meant to murder
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I'm not afraid!
Oh, gentlemen, isn't it too base of you to say that to my face?
It's base, because I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder
him, but I might have done it. And, what's more, I went out
of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him.
But, you see, I didn't murder him; you see, my guardian angel saved
me&mdash;that's what you've not taken into account. And that's why
it's so base of you. For I didn't kill him, I didn't kill him! Do
you hear, I did not kill him.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during
the whole interrogation.
</p>

<pb n='536'/><anchor id='Pg536'/>

<p>
<q>And what has he told you, gentlemen&mdash;Smerdyakov, I mean?</q>
he added suddenly, after a pause. <q>May I ask that question?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may ask any question,</q> the prosecutor replied with frigid
severity, <q>any question relating to the facts of the case, and we
are, I repeat, bound to answer every inquiry you make. We found
the servant Smerdyakov, concerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious
in his bed, in an epileptic fit of extreme severity, that had
recurred, possibly, ten times. The doctor who was with us told us,
after seeing him, that he may possibly not outlive the night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if that's so, the devil must have killed him,</q> broke suddenly
from Mitya, as though until that moment he had been asking
himself: <q>Was it Smerdyakov or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will come back to this later,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch decided.
<q>Now, wouldn't you like to continue your statement?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted.
After resting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently depressed.
He was exhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make
things worse the prosecutor exasperated him, as though intentionally,
by vexatious interruptions about <q>trifling points.</q> Scarcely had
Mitya described how, sitting on the wall, he had struck Grigory on
the head with the pestle, while the old man had hold of his left leg,
and how he had then jumped down to look at him, when the prosecutor
stopped him to ask him to describe exactly how he was sitting
on the wall. Mitya was surprised.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the
wall and one on the other.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the pestle?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The pestle was in my hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it
a violent blow you gave him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall
then and showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what
direction?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're making fun of me, aren't you?</q> asked Mitya, looking
haughtily at the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.
</p>

<p>
Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his
arm.
</p>

<pb n='537'/><anchor id='Pg537'/>

<p>
<q>This was how I struck him! That's how I knocked him down!
What more do you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped
down, with what object, and what you had in view?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I'd hurt ...
I don't know what for!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Though you were so excited and were running away?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, though I was excited and running away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You wanted to help him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Help!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him.... I don't
remember.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't remember? Then you didn't quite know what you
were doing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all. I remember everything&mdash;every detail. I jumped
down to look at him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him
to consciousness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure
whether he was alive or not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not a doctor. I couldn't decide. I ran away thinking I'd
killed him. And now he's recovered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excellent,</q> commented the prosecutor. <q>Thank you. That's all
I wanted. Kindly proceed.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alas! it never entered Mitya's head to tell them, though he remembered
it, that he had jumped back from pity, and standing over
the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret: <q>You've
come to grief, old man&mdash;there's no help for it. Well, there you
must lie.</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man
had jumped back <q>at such a moment and in such excitement simply
with the object of ascertaining whether the <emph>only</emph> witness of
his crime were dead; that he must therefore have been a man of
great strength, coolness, decision and foresight even at such a moment,</q> ...
and so on. The prosecutor was satisfied: <q>I've provoked
the nervous fellow by <q>trifles</q> and he has said more than he
meant to.</q>
</p>

<pb n='538'/><anchor id='Pg538'/>

<p>
With painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled
up immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with
your hands so covered with blood, and, as it appears, your face,
too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I didn't notice the blood at all at the time,</q> answered
Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's quite likely. It does happen sometimes.</q> The prosecutor
exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>I simply didn't notice. You're quite right there, prosecutor,</q>
Mitya assented suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Next came the account of Mitya's sudden determination to <q>step
aside</q> and make way for their happiness. But he could not make
up his mind to open his heart to them as before, and tell them
about <q>the queen of his soul.</q> He disliked speaking of her before
these chilly persons <q>who were fastening on him like bugs.</q> And
so in response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and
abruptly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to
live for? That question stared me in the face. Her first rightful
lover had come back, the man who wronged her but who'd hurried
back to offer his love, after five years, and atone for the wrong
with marriage.... So I knew it was all over for me.... And
behind me disgrace, and that blood&mdash;Grigory's.... What had I
to live for? So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load
them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And a grand feast the night before?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen!
Do make haste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from
here, beyond the village, and I'd planned to do it at five o'clock in
the morning. And I had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it
at Perhotin's when I loaded my pistols. Here's the letter. Read it!
It's not for you I tell it,</q> he added contemptuously. He took it
from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table. The lawyers
read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it to the papers connected
with the case.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you didn't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin's?
You were not afraid then of arousing suspicion?</q>
</p>

<pb n='539'/><anchor id='Pg539'/>

<p>
<q>What suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here
just the same, and shot myself at five o'clock, and you wouldn't
have been in time to do anything. If it hadn't been for what's
happened to my father, you would have known nothing about it,
and wouldn't have come here. Oh, it's the devil's doing. It was
the devil murdered father, it was through the devil that you found
it out so soon. How did you manage to get here so quick? It's
marvelous, a dream!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held
in your hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ...
a lot of money ... a bundle of hundred-rouble notes, and
that his servant-boy saw it too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true, gentlemen. I remember it was so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, there's one little point presents itself. Can you inform
us,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, <q>where
did you get so much money all of a sudden, when it appears from
the facts, from the reckoning of time, that you had not been
home?</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor's brows contracted at the question being asked
so plainly, but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't go home,</q> answered Mitya, apparently perfectly
composed, but looking at the floor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me then to repeat my question,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
went on as though creeping up to the subject. <q>Where were you
able to procure such a sum all at once, when by your own confession,
at five o'clock the same day you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin,
and then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand
which she wouldn't give me, and so on, and all the rest of it,</q>
Mitya interrupted sharply. <q>Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it,
and suddenly thousands turned up, eh? Do you know, gentlemen,
you're both afraid now <q>what if he won't tell us where he got it?</q>
That's just how it is. I'm not going to tell you, gentlemen. You've
guessed right. You'll never know,</q> said Mitya, chipping out each
word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silent for
a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance
for us to know,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.
</p>

<pb n='540'/><anchor id='Pg540'/>

<p>
<q>I understand; but still I won't tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner
that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought it
to his interest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might do
himself by his silence, especially in a case of such importance as&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I've heard that
rigmarole before,</q> Mitya interrupted again. <q>I can see for myself
how important it is, and that this is the vital point, and still I
won't say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it to us? It's not our business, but yours. You are
doing yourself harm,</q> observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, gentlemen, joking apart</q>&mdash;Mitya lifted his eyes and
looked firmly at them both&mdash;<q>I had an inkling from the first that
we should come to loggerheads at this point. But at first when I
began to give my evidence, it was all still far away and misty; it
was all floating, and I was so simple that I began with the supposition
of mutual confidence existing between us. Now I can see
for myself that such confidence is out of the question, for in any
case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-block. And
now we've come to it! It's impossible and there's an end of it!
But I don't blame you. You can't believe it all simply on my word.
I understand that, of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
He relapsed into gloomy silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Couldn't you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent
about the chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us
some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong
enough to induce you to refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of
danger to you?</q>
</p>
<p>
Mitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I'll
tell you the reason why and give you that hint, though you don't
deserve it. I won't speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be
a stain on my honor. The answer to the question where I got the
money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and
robbing of my father, if I had murdered and robbed him. That's
why I can't tell you. I can't for fear of disgrace. What, gentlemen,
are you going to write that down?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, we'll write it down,</q> lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<pb n='541'/><anchor id='Pg541'/>

<p>
<q>You ought not to write that down about <q>disgrace.</q> I only told
you that in the goodness of my heart. I needn't have told you. I
made you a present of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at
once. Oh, well, write&mdash;write what you like,</q> he concluded, with
scornful disgust. <q>I'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up
my head before you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And can't you tell us the nature of that disgrace?</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch hazarded.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor frowned darkly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>c'est fini</foreign>,
don't trouble yourselves. It's not worth while
soiling one's hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it
is. You're not worth it&mdash;no one is ... Enough, gentlemen. I'm
not going on.</q>
</p>

<p>
This was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not
insist further, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch's eyes he saw that he had
not given up hope.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands
when you went into Mr. Perhotin's&mdash;how many roubles exactly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't tell you that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three
thousand from Madame Hohlakov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I won't say how much I
had.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and
what you have done since you arrived?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! you might ask the people here about that. But I'll tell you
if you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to do so, but we won't repeat his story. He told it
dryly and curtly. Of the raptures of his love he said nothing, but
told them that he abandoned his determination to shoot himself,
owing to <q>new factors in the case.</q> He told the story without going
into motives or details. And this time the lawyers did not worry
him much. It was obvious that there was no essential point of interest
to them here.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall verify all that. We will come back to it during the
examination of the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in
your presence,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion. <q>And now
<pb n='542'/><anchor id='Pg542'/>
allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession,
especially all the money you still have about you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is
necessary. I'm surprised, indeed, that you haven't inquired about
it before. It's true I couldn't get away anywhere. I'm sitting here
where I can be seen. But here's my money&mdash;count it&mdash;take it.
That's all, I think.</q>
</p>

<p>
He turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change&mdash;two
pieces of twenty copecks&mdash;he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket.
They counted the money, which amounted to eight hundred and
thirty-six roubles, and forty copecks.
</p>

<p>
<q>And is that all?</q> asked the investigating lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred
roubles at Plotnikovs'. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver
twenty, here you lost two hundred, then....</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily.
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning.
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.
</p>

<p>
<q>With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred
at first?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose so,</q> snapped Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>How is it they all assert there was much more?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let them assert it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you asserted it yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I did, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not
yet examined. Don't be anxious about your money. It will be
properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ...
what is beginning ... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved
that you have undisputed right to it. Well, and now....</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya
firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and
thorough search <q>of your clothes and everything else....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means, gentlemen. I'll turn out all my pockets, if you
like.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='543'/><anchor id='Pg543'/>

<p>
<q>What! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Won't you search me as I
am! Can't you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take
off your clothes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As you like,</q> Mitya submitted gloomily; <q>only, please, not here,
but behind the curtains. Who will search them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behind the curtains, of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face
wore an expression of peculiar solemnity.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya</head>

<p>
Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed.
He could never, even a minute before, have conceived that
any one could behave like that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What
was worst of all, there was something humiliating in it, and on their
side something <q>supercilious and scornful.</q> It was nothing to take
off his coat, but he was asked to undress further, or rather not
asked but <q>commanded,</q> he quite understood that. From pride
and contempt he submitted without a word. Several peasants accompanied
the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain.
<q>To be ready if force is required,</q> thought Mitya, <q>and perhaps
for some other reason, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, must I take off my shirt, too?</q> he asked sharply, but
Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with
the prosecutor in examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat
and the cap; and it was evident that they were both much interested
in the scrutiny. <q>They make no bones about it,</q> thought
Mitya, <q>they don't keep up the most elementary politeness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I ask you for the second time&mdash;need I take off my shirt or not?</q>
he said, still more sharply and irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so
it seemed to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the
<pb n='544'/><anchor id='Pg544'/>
lawyers. There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left
side at the back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There
were bloodstains on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover,
in the presence of the peasant witnesses, passed his fingers
along the collar, the cuffs, and all the seams of the coat and
trousers, obviously looking for something&mdash;money, of course. He
didn't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of
sewing money up in his clothes.
</p>

<p>
<q>He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,</q> Mitya muttered
to himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with
amazing frankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind
the curtain, fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch's
attention to the cap, which they were also fingering.
</p>

<p>
<q>You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,</q> observed the
secretary. <q>Last summer he received the wages of the whole office,
and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk. And
where was it found? Why, in just such pipings in his cap. The
hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the
piping.</q>
</p>

<p>
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko's case perfectly, and so
laid aside Mitya's cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more
thoroughly examined later.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me,</q> cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing
that the right cuff of Mitya's shirt was turned in, and covered with
blood, <q>excuse me, what's that, blood?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Mitya jerked out.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking
after Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing
his hands at Perhotin's.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must take off your shirt, too. That's very important as
material evidence.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.
</p>

<p>
<q>What, am I to stay naked?</q> he shouted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile
take off your socks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're not joking? Is that really necessary?</q> Mitya's eyes
flashed.
</p>

<pb n='545'/><anchor id='Pg545'/>

<p>
<q>We are in no mood for joking,</q> answered Nikolay Parfenovitch
sternly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if I must&mdash;</q> muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed,
he took off his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were
clothed, while he was naked, and strange to say, when he was undressed
he felt somehow guilty in their presence, and was almost
ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them, and that now
they had a perfect right to despise him.
</p>

<p>
<q>When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when
one's the only one undressed and everybody is looking, it's degrading,</q>
he kept repeating to himself, again and again. <q>It's like a
dream, I've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions.</q>
It was a misery to him to take off his socks. They were very dirty,
and so were his underclothes, and now every one could see it. And
what was worse, he disliked his feet. All his life he had thought
both his big toes hideous. He particularly loathed the coarse, flat,
crooked nail on the right one, and now they would all see it. Feeling
intolerably ashamed made him, at once and intentionally, rougher.
He pulled off his shirt, himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Would you like to look anywhere else if you're not ashamed to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there's no need to, at present.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, am I to stay naked like this?</q> he added savagely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that can't be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down
here for a while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed,
and I ... I'll see to all this.</q>
</p>

<p>
All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the
search was drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and
the clothes were carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went
out, too. Mitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in
silence, never taking their eyes off him. Mitya wrapped himself up
in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet stuck out, and he
couldn't pull the quilt over so as to cover them. Nikolay Parfenovitch
seemed to be gone a long time, <q>an insufferable time.</q> <q>He
thinks of me as a puppy,</q> thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth. <q>That
rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts
him to see me naked!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined
and returned to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay
<pb n='546'/><anchor id='Pg546'/>
Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes, brought in
behind him by a peasant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here are clothes for you,</q> he observed airily, seeming well
satisfied with the success of his mission. <q>Mr. Kalganov has kindly
provided these for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt.
Luckily he had them all in his trunk. You can keep your own
socks and underclothes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya flew into a passion.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have other people's clothes!</q> he shouted menacingly,
<q>give me my own!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's impossible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they
succeeded somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon
him that his clothes, being stained with blood, must be <q>included
with the other material evidence,</q> and that they <q>had not even the
right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the
possible outcome of the case.</q> Mitya at last understood this. He
subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. He
merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes were much
better than his old ones, and that he disliked <q>gaining by the
change.</q> The coat was, besides, <q>ridiculously tight. Am I to be
dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?</q>
</p>

<p>
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov
was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a
little too long. But the coat turned out to be really tight in the
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn it all! I can hardly button it,</q> Mitya grumbled. <q>Be
so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his
clothes, and it's not my doing that they've dressed me up like a
clown.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend
you his clothes, but sorry about all this business,</q> mumbled Nikolay
Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting
here?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was asked to go back to the <q>other room.</q> Mitya went in,
scowling with anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one.
<pb n='547'/><anchor id='Pg547'/>
Dressed in another man's clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in
the eyes of the peasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face
appeared, for some reason, in the doorway, and vanished immediately.
<q>He's come to look at me dressed up,</q> thought Mitya. He
sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd nightmarish
feeling, as though he were out of his mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's
left for you,</q> he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor.
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he
disdained to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out
on purpose to show every one how dirty they were&mdash;the scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,</q> observed
Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's question.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on
something.
</p>

<p>
<q>We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
Nikolay Parfenovitch went on, <q>but having received from
you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source
from which you obtained the money found upon you, we are, at
the present moment&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the stone in your ring?</q> Mitya interrupted suddenly, as
though awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three
large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ring?</q> repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins
in it, what stone is that?</q> Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a smoky topaz,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling.
<q>Would you like to look at it? I'll take it off ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, don't take it off,</q> cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking
up, and angry with himself. <q>Don't take it off ... there's no
need.... Damn it!... Gentlemen, you've sullied my heart!
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you, if I had really
killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie, and hide myself? No,
that's not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldn't do, and if I were
guilty, I swear I shouldn't have waited for your coming, or for the
sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself before this,
without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I
<pb n='548'/><anchor id='Pg548'/>
couldn't have learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in
this accursed night!... And should I have been like this on this
night, and at this moment, sitting with you, could I have talked
like this, could I have moved like this, could I have looked at you
and at the world like this, if I had really been the murderer of my
father, when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory
gave me no peace all night&mdash;not from fear&mdash;oh, not simply from
fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And you expect me
to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe
in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty
thing I've done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from
your accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the
door to my father and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed
him. Who was he? I'm racking my brains and can't think who.
But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can
tell you, and that's enough, enough, leave me alone.... Exile me,
punish me, but don't bother me any more. I'll say no more. Call
your witnesses!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined
to be absolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor
watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking,
observed, as though it were the most ordinary thing, with the most
frigid and composed air:
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may
as well inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of
evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has
been given us by Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery,
he clearly and emphatically stated, in reply to our questions,
that when, on coming out to the steps, and hearing a noise in the
garden, he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate
which stood open, before he noticed you running, as you have told
us already, in the dark from the open window where you saw your
father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while noticing the open
window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him, the door,
standing wide open&mdash;that door which you have stated to have been
shut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from
you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that
you must have run from that door, though, of course, he did not see
<pb n='549'/><anchor id='Pg549'/>
you do so with his own eyes, since he only noticed you first some
distance away in the garden, running towards the fence.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q> he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, <q>it's a barefaced lie.
He couldn't have seen the door open because it was shut. He's
lying!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement.
He does not waver. He adheres to it. We've cross-examined
him several times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times,</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch confirmed warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's false, false! It's either an attempt to slander me, or the
hallucination of a madman,</q> Mitya still shouted. <q>He's simply raving,
from loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it
when he came to.... He's raving.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after
his injuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from
the lodge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it's false, it's false! It can't be so! He's slandering me
from spite.... He couldn't have seen it ... I didn't come from
the door,</q> gasped Mitya.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him
impressively:
</p>

<p>
<q>Confront him with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you recognize this object?</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official
envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope
was empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with
open eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>It ... it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope
that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there's inscribed
on it, allow me, <q>For my little chicken</q> ... yes&mdash;three
thousand!</q> he shouted, <q>do you see, three thousand, do you see?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was
empty, and lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.</q>
</p>

<p>
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, it's Smerdyakov!</q> he shouted suddenly, at the top
of his voice. <q>It's he who's murdered him! He's robbed him! No
<pb n='550'/><anchor id='Pg550'/>
one else knew where the old man hid the envelope. It's Smerdyakov,
that's clear, now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the
pillow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never knew it. I've never seen it. This is the first time I've
looked at it. I'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was
the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn't
know ...</q> Mitya was completely breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased
father's pillow. You especially stated that it was under the
pillow, so you must have known it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We've got it written down,</q> confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense! It's absurd! I'd no idea it was under the pillow.
And perhaps it wasn't under the pillow at all.... It was just a
chance guess that it was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov
say? Have you asked him where it was? What does Smerdyakov
say? that's the chief point.... And I went out of my way to
tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinking that it
was under the pillow, and now you&mdash; Oh, you know how one says
the wrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov,
only Smerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn't even tell
me where it was! But it's his doing, his doing; there's no doubt
about it, he murdered him, that's as clear as daylight now,</q> Mitya
exclaimed more and more frantically, repeating himself incoherently,
and growing more and more exasperated and excited. <q>You must
understand that, and arrest him at once.... He must have killed
him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious,
that's clear now.... He gave the signal and father opened to him ...
for no one but he knew the signal, and without the signal
father would never have opened the door....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you're again forgetting the circumstance,</q> the prosecutor
observed, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note
of triumph, <q>that there was no need to give the signal if the door
already stood open when you were there, while you were in the
garden....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The door, the door,</q> muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless
at the prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were
silent.
</p>

<pb n='551'/><anchor id='Pg551'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, the door!... It's a nightmare! God is against me!</q> he
exclaimed, staring before him in complete stupefaction.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, you see,</q> the prosecutor went on with dignity, <q>and you
can judge for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we
have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out, a fact
which overwhelms you and us. On the other side your incomprehensible,
persistent, and, so to speak, obdurate silence with regard
to the source from which you obtained the money which was so
suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours earlier, on your
own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles!
In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we
to believe, and what can we depend upon? And don't accuse us
of being <q>frigid, cynical, scoffing people,</q> who are incapable of believing
in the generous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter
into our position ...</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well!</q> he exclaimed suddenly. <q>I will tell you my secret.
I'll tell you where I got the money!... I'll reveal my shame, that
I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch,
in a voice of almost pathetic delight, <q>that every sincere and
complete confession on your part at this moment may, later on,
have an immense influence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and
he checked himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he began, still in the same agitation, <q>I
want to make a full confession: that money was <emph>my own</emph>.</q>
The lawyers' faces lengthened. That was not at all what they
expected.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean?</q> faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, <q>when at
five o'clock on the same day, from your own confession&mdash;</q>
</p>

<pb n='552'/><anchor id='Pg552'/>

<p>
<q>Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession!
That's nothing to do with it now! That money was my own, my
own, that is, stolen by me ... not mine, I mean, but stolen by
me, and it was fifteen hundred roubles, and I had it on me all the
time, all the time ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But where did you get it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was
here, round my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I'd had it round my
neck a long time, it's a month since I put it round my neck ...
to my shame and disgrace!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And from whom did you ... appropriate it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean, <q>steal it</q>? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider
that I practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I <q>appropriated it.</q> I
consider I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Last night? But you said that it's a month since you ...
obtained it?...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don't be
uneasy. I didn't steal it from my father, but from her. Let me
tell you without interrupting. It's hard to do, you know. You see,
a month ago, I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my
betrothed. Do you know her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you know her. She's a noble creature, noblest of the
noble. But she has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ...
and hated me with good reason, good reason!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna!</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder.
The prosecutor, too, stared.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, don't take her name in vain! I'm a scoundrel to bring her
into it. Yes, I've seen that she hated me ... a long while....
From the very first, even that evening at my lodging ... but
enough, enough. You're unworthy even to know of that. No need
of that at all.... I need only tell you that she sent for me
a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister
and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldn't have sent
it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in my
life when I ... well, in fact, when I'd just come to love another,
her, she's sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off
here to Mokroe then, and wasted here in two days half that damned
<pb n='553'/><anchor id='Pg553'/>
three thousand, but the other half I kept on me. Well, I've kept
that other half, that fifteen hundred, like a locket round my neck,
but yesterday I undid it, and spent it. What's left of it, eight hundred
roubles, is in your hands now, Nikolay Parfenovitch. That's
the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me. How's that? Why, when you were here a month
ago you spent three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows
that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one
count it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you told every one yourself that you'd spent exactly three
thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town
said so. And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three
thousand. Yet I didn't spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred.
And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. That's how
it was, gentlemen. That's where I got that money yesterday....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is almost miraculous,</q> murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to inquire,</q> observed the prosecutor at last, <q>have
you informed any one whatever of this circumstance before, I
mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I told no one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What was your reason for this reticence? What was your
motive for making such a secret of it? To be more precise: You
have told us at last your secret, in your words, so <q>disgraceful,</q>
though in reality&mdash;that is, of course, comparatively speaking&mdash;this
action, that is, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging
to some one else, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at
least, only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful,
when one takes into consideration your character.... Even admitting
that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable, still,
discreditable is not <q>disgraceful.</q>... Many people have already
guessed, during this last month, about the three thousand of Katerina
Ivanovna's, that you have spent, and I heard the legend myself, apart
from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for instance, had
heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but the gossip
<pb n='554'/><anchor id='Pg554'/>
of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am not mistaken,
that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the money
was Katerina Ivanovna's, and so, it's extremely surprising to me that
hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an
extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by,
apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret....
It's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to
confess such a secret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia
would be better than confessing it ...</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not
conceal his vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all
his accumulated spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without
choosing words.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not the fifteen hundred that's the disgrace, but that I put
it apart from the rest of the three thousand,</q> said Mitya firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why?</q> smiled the prosecutor irritably. <q>What is there disgraceful,
to your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three
thousand you had discreditably, if you prefer, <q>disgracefully,</q> appropriated?
Your taking the three thousand is more important than
what you did with it. And by the way, why did you do that&mdash;why
did you set apart that half, for what purpose, for what object did
you do it? Can you explain that to us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!</q> cried Mitya. <q>I
put it aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and
to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has
been going on a whole month.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's incomprehensible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wonder at you. But I'll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is
incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate
three thousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I
spend it all, and next morning I go to her and say, <q>Katya, I've done
wrong, I've squandered your three thousand,</q> well, is that right?
No, it's not right&mdash;it's dishonest and cowardly, I'm a beast, with no
more self-control than a beast, that's so, isn't it? But still I'm not a
thief? Not a downright thief, you'll admit! I squandered it, but
I didn't steal it. Now a second, rather more favorable alternative:
follow me carefully, or I may get confused again&mdash;my head's going
round&mdash;and so, for the second alternative: I spend here only fifteen
<pb n='555'/><anchor id='Pg555'/>
hundred out of the three thousand, that is, only half. Next day I
go and take that half to her: <q>Katya, take this fifteen hundred from
me, I'm a low beast, and an untrustworthy scoundrel, for I've wasted
half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so keep me from temptation!</q>
Well, what of that alternative? I should be a beast and a
scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not altogether
a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but have
kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back
half, I should pay back what I'd spent, that I should never give up
trying to, that I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that
case I should be a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what
you like, not a thief!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I admit that there is a certain distinction,</q> said the prosecutor,
with a cold smile. <q>But it's strange that you see such a vital difference.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel,
and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a
thief, it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don't
know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower
than a scoundrel, that's my conviction. Listen, I carry the money
about me a whole month, I may make up my mind to give it back
to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer, but I cannot make up
my mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day, and
every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month
I can't bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking,
is that right?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, that's not right, that I can quite understand, and that
I don't dispute,</q> answered the prosecutor with reserve. <q>And let
us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if
you will be so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that
you have still not told us, altogether we've asked you, why, in the
first place, you halved the money, squandering one half and hiding
the other? For what purpose exactly did you hide it, what did you
mean to do with that fifteen hundred? I insist upon that question,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course!</q> cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead;
<q>forgive me, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief
point, or you'd understand in a minute, for it's just the motive of
<pb n='556'/><anchor id='Pg556'/>
it that's the disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man,
my dead father. He was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna,
and I was jealous; I thought then that she was hesitating between me
and him. So I kept thinking every day, suppose she were to make
up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she were to leave off tormenting
me, and were suddenly to say to me, <q>I love you, not him; take
me to the other end of the world.</q> And I'd only forty copecks; how
could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I'd be lost. You
see, I didn't know her then, I didn't understand her, I thought she
wanted money, and that she wouldn't forgive my poverty. And so
I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it
up, calculating on it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had
sewn it up, I went off to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base.
Do you understand now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Both the lawyers laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to
have squandered it all,</q> chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, <q>for after
all what does it amount to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to! Oh, God, you
horrify me by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen
hundred sewn up round my neck, every day and every hour I said
to myself, <q>You're a thief! you're a thief!</q> Yes, that's why I've been
so savage all this month, that's why I fought in the tavern, that's
why I attacked my father, it was because I felt I was a thief. I
couldn't make up my mind, I didn't dare even to tell Alyosha, my
brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel
and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried it I said
to myself at the same time every hour: <q>No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
you may yet not be a thief.</q> Why? Because I might go next day
and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday
I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from
Fenya's to Perhotin. I hadn't been able till that moment to bring
myself to it. And it was only when I tore it off that I became a
downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life.
Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to
Katya and saying, <q>I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief!</q> Do you understand
now? Do you understand?</q>
</p>

<pb n='557'/><anchor id='Pg557'/>

<p>
<q>What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch interrupted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to
die at five o'clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made
no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see
