exclaimed Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. <q>Stay,
Alyosha, hush! Since I've said so much I'll tell the whole truth&mdash;he's
been to see him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped
here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and
the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you
about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact.
He came secretly.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The
news evidently impressed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan doesn't talk to me of Mitya's case,</q> he said slowly. <q>He's
said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go
to see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I've not been to him
<pb n='642'/><anchor id='Pg642'/>
for the last three weeks. H'm!... if he was there a week ago ...
there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There has been a change,</q> Grushenka assented quickly. <q>They
have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was
a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can't rest. Before then, he was
cheerful&mdash;and, indeed, he is cheerful now&mdash;but when he shakes his
head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling
at the hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know there
is something on his mind worrying him.... I know! He was
cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you said he was worried.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable
for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you
know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him&mdash;with this awful
thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as
though he were a baby himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he
say, <q>Don't tell him</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he told me, <q>Don't tell him.</q> It's you that Mitya's most
afraid of. Because it's a secret: he said himself it was a secret.
Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and
come and tell me,</q> Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness.
<q>Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that's in store for
me. That's why I sent for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think it's something to do with you? If it were, he
wouldn't have told you there was a secret.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn't dare to.
He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won't tell me
what it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you think yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do I think? It's the end for me, that's what I think.
They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina's in it. It's
all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that
means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand&mdash;warns me.
He is planning to throw me over, that's the whole secret. They've
planned it together, the three of them&mdash;Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan
Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I've been wanting to ask you a long time.
A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina,
<pb n='643'/><anchor id='Pg643'/>
because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not?
Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna,
I think.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, that's what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver,
that's what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as
to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can't disguise
what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I'll give it to
him, I'll give it to him! <q>You believe I did it,</q> he said. He said
that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him!
You wait, I'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I'll just say a
word then ... I'll tell everything then!</q>
</p>

<p>
And again she cried bitterly.
</p>

<p>
<q>This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,</q> Alyosha said, getting
up. <q>First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the
world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second
thing is that I don't want to worm his secret out of him, but if
he'll tell me of himself to-day, I shall tell him straight out that I
have promised to tell you. Then I'll come to you to-day, and tell
you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to
do with it, and that the secret is about something else. That's certain.
It isn't likely it's about Katerina Ivanovna, it seems to me.
Good-by for now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He
saw that she put little faith in his consolation, but she was better
for having had her sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was
sorry to leave her in such a state of mind, but he was in haste. He
had a great many things to do still.

<head>Chapter II. The Injured Foot</head>

<p>
The first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov,
and he hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not
be too late for Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing
for the last three weeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up,
<pb n='644'/><anchor id='Pg644'/>
and though she was not in bed, she lay all day half-reclining on the
couch in her boudoir, in a fascinating but decorous
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>déshabillé</foreign>.
Alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that, in spite of
her illness, Madame Hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy&mdash;top-knots,
ribbons, loose wrappers, had made their appearance, and he
had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed such ideas from
his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the young
official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go
straight to Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had
sent a maid to him the previous day, specially asking him to come
to her <q>about something very important,</q> a request which, for certain
reasons, had interest for Alyosha. But while the maid went
to take his name in to Lise, Madame Hohlakov heard of his arrival
from some one, and immediately sent to beg him to come to her
<q>just for one minute.</q> Alyosha reflected that it was better to
accede to the mamma's request, or else she would be sending down
to Lise's room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov
was lying on a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was
evidently in a state of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted
Alyosha with cries of rapture.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's ages, ages, perfect ages since I've seen you! It's a whole
week&mdash;only think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago,
on Wednesday. You have come to see Lise. I'm sure you meant
to slip into her room on tiptoe, without my hearing you. My dear,
dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only knew how worried I am
about her! But of that later, though that's the most important
thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly
with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima&mdash;God
rest his soul!</q> (she crossed herself)&mdash;<q>I look upon you as a monk,
though you look charming in your new suit. Where did you find
such a tailor in these parts? No, no, that's not the chief thing&mdash;of
that later. Forgive me for sometimes calling you Alyosha; an
old woman like me may take liberties,</q> she smiled coquettishly;
<q>but that will do later, too. The important thing is that I shouldn't
forget what is important. Please remind me of it yourself. As soon
as my tongue runs away with me, you just say <q>the important thing?</q>
Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever since
<pb n='645'/><anchor id='Pg645'/>
Lise took back her promise&mdash;her childish promise, Alexey Fyodorovitch&mdash;to
marry you, you've realized, of course, that it was only
the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to
her chair&mdash;thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor
Katya sent for from Moscow for your unhappy brother, who will
to-morrow&mdash;But why speak of to-morrow? I am ready to die at
the very thought of to-morrow. Ready to die of curiosity....
That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I paid him
fifty roubles for the visit. But that's not the point, that's not the
point again. You see, I'm mixing everything up. I am in such a
hurry. Why am I in a hurry? I don't understand. It's awful how
I seem growing unable to understand anything. Everything seems
mixed up in a sort of tangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will
jump up and run away, and that will be all I shall see of you.
Goodness! Why are we sitting here and no coffee? Yulia, Glafira,
coffee!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just
had coffee.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At Agrafena Alexandrovna's.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At ... at that woman's? Ah, it's she has brought ruin on
every one. I know nothing about it though. They say she has
become a saint, though it's rather late in the day. She had better
have done it before. What use is it now? Hush, hush, Alexey
Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you that I am afraid I
shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shall certainly go, I
am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my chair;
besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know,
I am a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don't know
what I shall say. One has to take an oath, hasn't one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; but I don't think you will be able to go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage
act, and then they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married,
and all this so quickly, so quickly, everything's changing, and at
last&mdash;nothing. All grow old and have death to look forward to.
Well, so be it! I am weary. This Katya,
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>cette charmante personne</foreign>,
has disappointed all my hopes. Now she is going to follow one of
your brothers to Siberia, and your other brother is going to follow
<pb n='646'/><anchor id='Pg646'/>
her, and will live in the nearest town, and they will all torment one
another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of all&mdash;the publicity.
The story has been told a million times over in all the papers in
Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there's a
paragraph that I was <q>a dear friend</q> of your brother's &mdash;&mdash;, I can't
repeat the horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday.
Here, in the Petersburg paper <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi>. The paper began coming out
this year. I am awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now
it pays me out&mdash;this is what gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this
passage. Read it.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been
under her pillow.
</p>

<p>
It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed
and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head.
The paragraph was very typical, and must have been a great shock
to her, but, fortunately perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind
fixed on any one subject at that moment, and so might race off in
a minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had
spread all over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about
his brother, about the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read
in the course of those two months, among other equally credible
items! One paper had even stated that he had gone into a monastery
and become a monk, in horror at his brother's crime. Another contradicted
this, and stated that he and his elder, Father Zossima, had
broken into the monastery chest and <q>made tracks from the monastery.</q>
The present paragraph in the paper <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi> was under the
heading, <q>The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.</q> (That, alas!
was the name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.)
It was brief, and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in
it. No names appeared, in fact. It was merely stated that the
criminal, whose approaching trial was making such a sensation&mdash;retired
army captain, an idle swaggerer, and reactionary bully&mdash;was
continually involved in amorous intrigues, and particularly popular
with certain ladies <q>who were pining in solitude.</q> One such lady,
a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a grown-up
<pb n='647'/><anchor id='Pg647'/>
daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before
the crime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that
he would elope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting
on escaping punishment, had preferred to murder his father to
get the three thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged
charms of his pining lady. This playful paragraph finished, of
course, with an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness
of parricide and at the lately abolished institution of serfdom.
Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha folded up the paper and handed
it back to Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that must be me,</q> she hurried on again. <q>Of course I
am meant. Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold
mines to him, and here they talk of <q>middle-aged charms</q> as though
that were my motive! He writes that out of spite! God Almighty
forgive him for the middle-aged charms, as I forgive him! You
know it's&mdash; Do you know who it is? It's your friend Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps,</q> said Alyosha, <q>though I've heard nothing about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's he, it's he! No <q>perhaps</q> about it. You know I turned
him out of the house.... You know all that story, don't you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but
why it was, I haven't heard ... from you, at least.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, then you've heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose,
abuses me dreadfully?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you've
given him up I haven't heard from him either. I meet him very
seldom now, indeed. We are not friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, I'll tell you all about it. There's no help for it,
I'll confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame.
Only a little, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn't count.
You see, my dear boy</q>&mdash;Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch
and a charming, though enigmatic, smile played about her lips&mdash;<q rend='pre'>you
see, I suspect ... You must forgive me, Alyosha. I am like
a mother to you.... No, no; quite the contrary. I speak to you
now as though you were my father&mdash;mother's quite out of place.
Well, it's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima, that's just
it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man, your
friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can't be angry with him. I feel
cross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe
<pb n='648'/><anchor id='Pg648'/>
it, seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I
only noticed it later. At first&mdash;a month ago&mdash;he only began to
come oftener to see me, almost every day; though, of course, we
were acquainted before. I knew nothing about it ... and suddenly
it dawned upon me, and I began to notice things with surprise.
You know, two months ago, that modest, charming, excellent young
man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who's in the service here, began to be a
regular visitor at the house. You met him here ever so many times
yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man, isn't he? He
comes once every three days, not every day (though I should be glad
to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I love
young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost
the mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,
certainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat.
On that awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the
night. And your friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always
stretches them out on the carpet.... He began hinting at his
feelings, in fact, and one day, as he was going, he squeezed my hand
terribly hard. My foot began to swell directly after he pressed my
hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here before, and would
you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling at him, for some
reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together and
laughed inwardly. So I was sitting here alone&mdash;no, I was laid up
then. Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in,
and only fancy! brought me some verses of his own composition&mdash;a
short poem, on my bad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem.
Wait a minute&mdash;how did it go?</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>A captivating little foot.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I've got
it here. I'll show it to you later. But it's a charming thing&mdash;charming;
and, you know, it's not only about the foot, it had a
good moral, too, a charming idea, only I've forgotten it; in fact, it
was just the thing for an album. So, of course, I thanked him, and
he was evidently flattered. I'd hardly had time to thank him when
in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly looked as black as
night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way, for Rakitin
certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses. I
<pb n='649'/><anchor id='Pg649'/>
had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr
Ilyitch the verses and didn't say who was the author. But I am
convinced that he guessed, though he won't own it to this day, and
declares he had no idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch
began to laugh at once, and fell to criticizing it. <q>Wretched doggerel,</q>
he said they were, <q>some divinity student must have written
them,</q> and with such vehemence, such vehemence! Then, instead
of laughing, your friend flew into a rage. <q>Good gracious!</q> I
thought, <q>they'll fly at each other.</q> <q>It was I who wrote them,</q> said
he. <q>I wrote them as a joke,</q> he said, <q>for I think it degrading to
write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a
monument to your Pushkin for writing about women's feet, while
I wrote with a moral purpose, and you,</q> said he, <q>are an advocate
of serfdom. You've no humane ideas,</q> said he. <q>You have no modern
enlightened feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are
a mere official,</q> he said, <q>and you take bribes.</q> Then I began screaming
and imploring them. And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything
but a coward. He at once took up the most gentlemanly tone,
looked at him sarcastically, listened, and apologized. <q>I'd no idea,</q>
said he. <q>I shouldn't have said it, if I had known. I should have
praised it. Poets are all so irritable,</q> he said. In short, he laughed at
him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He explained to
me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was in earnest.
Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, <q>Would it,
or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for
shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?</q> And, would you believe
it, I lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the
proper thing or not. I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart
began to beat, and I couldn't make up my mind whether to make
an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be telling me, <q>Speak,</q> and
the other <q>No, don't speak.</q> And no sooner had the second voice
said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, there was a fuss.
I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, <q>It's painful for me to say it,
but I don't wish to see you in my house again.</q> So I turned him out.
Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting
it on. I wasn't angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly
fancied&mdash;that was what did it&mdash;that it would be such a fine scene....
And yet, believe me, it was quite natural, for I really shed
<pb n='650'/><anchor id='Pg650'/>
tears and cried for several days afterwards, and then suddenly, one
afternoon, I forgot all about it. So it's a fortnight since he's been
here, and I kept wondering whether he would come again. I wondered
even yesterday, then suddenly last night came this <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi>.
I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He must have
written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it,
and they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha,
it's awful how I keep talking and don't say what I want to say.
Ah! the words come of themselves!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,</q>
Alyosha faltered.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen,
what is an aberration?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What aberration?</q> asked Alyosha, wondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.
Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming
creature, only I never can make out who it is she is in love
with. She was with me some time ago and I couldn't get anything
out of her. Especially as she won't talk to me except on the surface
now. She is always talking about my health and nothing else,
and she takes up such a tone with me, too. I simply said to myself,
<q>Well, so be it. I don't care</q>... Oh, yes. I was talking of aberration.
This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come? Of
course, you know it&mdash;the one who discovers madmen. You wrote
for him. No, it wasn't you, but Katya. It's all Katya's doing.
Well, you see, a man may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly
have an aberration. He may be conscious and know what he is doing
and yet be in a state of aberration. And there's no doubt that
Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from aberration. They found
out about aberration as soon as the law courts were reformed. It's
all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctor has been
here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines.
<q>How did he seem then?</q> he asked me. He must have been in a
state of aberration. He came in shouting, <q>Money, money, three
thousand! Give me three thousand!</q> and then went away and
immediately did the murder. <q>I don't want to murder him,</q> he said,
<pb n='651'/><anchor id='Pg651'/>
and he suddenly went and murdered him. That's why they'll acquit
him, because he struggled against it and yet he murdered him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But he didn't murder him,</q> Alyosha interrupted rather sharply.
He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grigory?</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck
him down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed
Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why, why?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow
Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from
aberration; he went and committed the murder. As for his saying
he didn't, he very likely doesn't remember. Only, you know, it'll be
better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him.
And that's how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory.
It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that's better, ever so
much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his
father, I don't defend that. Children ought to honor their parents,
and yet it would be better if it were he, as you'd have nothing to
cry over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when
he was conscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them
acquit him&mdash;that's so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed
law courts are. I knew nothing about it, but they say they
have been so a long time. And when I heard it yesterday, I was
so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at once. And if
he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courts to
dinner with me, and I'll have a party of friends, and we'll drink to
the reformed law courts. I don't believe he'd be dangerous; besides,
I'll invite a great many friends, so that he could always be
led out if he did anything. And then he might be made a justice
of the peace or something in another town, for those who have been
in trouble themselves make the best judges. And, besides, who isn't
suffering from aberration nowadays?&mdash;you, I, all of us are in a state
of aberration, and there are ever so many examples of it: a man
sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him, he takes a pistol
and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one blames
him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The
<pb n='652'/><anchor id='Pg652'/>
doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my
Lise is in a state of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday,
and the day before, too, and to-day I suddenly realized that it's all
due to aberration. Oh, Lise grieves me so! I believe she's quite mad.
Why did she send for you? Did she send for you or did you come
of yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.</q> Alyosha got
up resolutely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that's what's
most important,</q> Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into
tears. <q>God knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it's
no matter her sending for you on the sly, without telling her mother.
But forgive me, I can't trust my daughter so easily to your brother
Ivan Fyodorovitch, though I still consider him the most chivalrous
young man. But only fancy, he's been to see Lise and I knew nothing
about it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How? What? When?</q> Alyosha was exceedingly surprised.
He had not sat down again and listened standing.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will tell you; that's perhaps why I asked you to come, for I
don't know now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch
has been to see me twice, since he came back from Moscow.
First time he came as a friend to call on me, and the second time
Katya was here and he came because he heard she was here. I
didn't, of course, expect him to come often, knowing what a lot he
has to do as it is, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>vous comprenez, cette affaire et
la mort terrible de votre papa</foreign>. But I suddenly heard he'd been here again,
not to see me but to see Lise. That's six days ago now. He came, stayed five
minutes, and went away. And I didn't hear of it till three days
afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for
Lise directly. She laughed. <q>He thought you were asleep,</q> she said,
<q>and came in to me to ask after your health.</q> Of course, that's how
it happened. But Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me!
Would you believe it, one night, four days ago, just after you saw
her last time, and had gone away, she suddenly had a fit, screaming,
shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never have hysterics? Then, next
day another fit, and the same thing on the third, and yesterday too,
and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly screamed out, <q>I
hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting him come to
<pb n='653'/><anchor id='Pg653'/>
the house again.</q> I was struck dumb at these amazing words, and
answered, <q>On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent
young man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?</q>&mdash;for
all this business is a misfortune, isn't it? She suddenly burst
out laughing at my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was
pleased; I thought I had amused her and the fits would pass off,
especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on
account of his strange visits without my knowledge, and meant to
ask him for an explanation. But early this morning Lise waked up
and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you believe it, slapped
her in the face. That's monstrous; I am always polite to my servants.
And an hour later she was hugging Yulia's feet and kissing
them. She sent a message to me that she wasn't coming to me at
all, and would never come and see me again, and when I dragged
myself down to her, she rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed
me, she pushed me out of the room without saying a word, so I
couldn't find out what was the matter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,
I rest all my hopes on you, and, of course, my whole life is in
your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and find out everything
from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell me&mdash;me, her
mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply the
death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand no
more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then
something awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr
Ilyitch!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin
enter the room. <q>You are late, you are late! Well, sit down,
speak, put us out of suspense. What does the counsel say. Where
are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Lise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes. You won't forget, you won't forget what I asked you?
It's a question of life and death!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I won't forget, if I can ... but I am so late,</q> muttered
Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, be sure, be sure to come in; don't say <q>If you can.</q> I shall
die if you don't,</q> Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha
had already left the room.

<head>Chapter III. A Little Demon</head>

<p>
Going in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair,
in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to
walk. She did not move to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were
simply riveted on his face. There was a feverish look in her eyes, her
face was pale and yellow. Alyosha was amazed at the change that
had taken place in her in three days. She was positively thinner.
She did not hold out her hand to him. He touched the thin, long
fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he sat down facing
her, without a word.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,</q> Lise said
curtly, <q>and mamma's kept you there for hours; she's just been telling
you about me and Yulia.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen
and I do listen, there's no harm in that. I don't apologize.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are upset about something?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been reflecting
for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and
shall not be your wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were
to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after
you, you'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer
back, too. If you were forty, you would still go on taking my
love-letters for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
She suddenly laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,</q>
Alyosha smiled to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself
with you. What's more, I don't want to feel ashamed with you,
just with you. Alyosha, why is it I don't respect you? I am very
fond of you, but I don't respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn't
talk to you without shame, should I?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<pb n='655'/><anchor id='Pg655'/>

<p>
<q>But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison.
Alyosha, you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully
for having so quickly allowed me not to love you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one
to torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go
away. I don't want to be happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are in love with disorder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I
keep imagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the
sly; it must be on the sly. They'll try to put it out, but it'll go on
burning. And I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness!
And how bored I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's your luxurious life,</q> said Alyosha, softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it better, then, to be poor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is better.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what your monk taught you. That's not true. Let me
be rich and all the rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and
not give any to any one else. Ach, don't speak, don't say anything,</q>
she shook her hand at him, though Alyosha had not opened
his mouth. <q>You've told me all that before, I know it all by heart.
It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder somebody, and even
if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps&mdash;why do nothing!
But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry
you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt,
shall we? Do you know Kalganov?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, <q>Why live in
real life? It's better to dream. One can dream the most delightful
things, but real life is a bore.</q> But he'll be married soon for all that;
he's been making love to me already. Can you spin tops?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, he's just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning
<pb n='656'/><anchor id='Pg656'/>
and then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry
him, I'll keep him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be
with me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things.
I don't want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world
for the greatest sin? You must know all about that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God will censure you.</q> Alyosha was watching her steadily.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just what I should like. I would go up and they would
censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should
dreadfully like to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you
still don't believe me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing
to set fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It's
a sort of disease.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but
that's not what I mean.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your
illness, perhaps.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You do despise me, though! It's simply that I don't want to do
good, I want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do evil?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would
be if everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes
think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I
should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly every one
would find it out. Every one will stand round and point their fingers
at me and I would look at them all. That would be awfully nice.
Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as
you say, to set fire to something. It happens sometimes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I not only say it, I shall do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not
lying one little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this
on purpose to annoy you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't think that ... though perhaps there is a little
desire to do that in it, too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='657'/><anchor id='Pg657'/>

<p>
<q>There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,</q> she declared, with
a strange fire in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness.
There was not a trace of humor or jesting in her face now, though,
in old days, fun and gayety never deserted her even at her most
<q>earnest</q> moments.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are moments when people love crime,</q> said Alyosha
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every
one loves crime, they love it always, not at some <q>moments.</q> You
know, it's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it
and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they hate
evil, but secretly they all love it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And are you still reading nasty books?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow
and I steal them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you ashamed to destroy yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I want to destroy myself. There's a boy here, who lay down between
the railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow!
Listen, your brother is being tried now for murdering his father
and every one loves his having killed his father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Loves his having killed his father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it's so awful,
but secretly they simply love it. I for one love it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is some truth in what you say about every one,</q> said
Alyosha softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, what ideas you have!</q> Lise shrieked in delight. <q>And you a
monk, too! You wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for
never telling lies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I
sometimes dream of devils. It's night; I am in my room with a
candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the
corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there's a crowd of
them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me. And
they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross myself
and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether, they
stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have
a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then
they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and
<pb n='658'/><anchor id='Pg658'/>
I cross myself again and they all draw back. It's awful fun. it
takes one's breath away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've had the same dream, too,</q> said Alyosha suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really?</q> cried Lise, surprised. <q>I say, Alyosha, don't laugh,
that's awfully important. Could two different people have the same
dream?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seems they can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important,</q> Lise went on, with
really excessive amazement. <q>It's not the dream that's important,
but your having the same dream as me. You never lie to me, don't
lie now: is it true? You are not laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's true.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she
was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,</q> she
said suddenly, in a supplicating voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll always come to see you, all my life,</q> answered Alyosha firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are the only person I can talk to, you know,</q> Lise began
again. <q>I talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole
world. And to you more readily than to myself. And I am not
a bit ashamed with you, not a bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed
with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it true that at Easter the Jews
steal a child and kill it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew,
who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both
hands, and then crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him
and crucified him, and afterwards, when he was tried, he said that
the child died soon, within four hours. That was <q>soon</q>! He said
the child moaned, kept on moaning and he stood admiring it. That's
nice!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nice?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him.
He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating
pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign>. I am
awfully fond of pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign>. Do
you like it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly
contorted, her eyes burned.
</p>

<pb n='659'/><anchor id='Pg659'/>

<p>
<q>You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all
night. I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a
child of four years old understands, you know), and all the while
the thought of pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign> haunted me. In the
morning I wrote a letter to a certain person, begging him <emph>particularly</emph> to
come and see me. He came and I suddenly told him all about the child
and the pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign>. <emph>All</emph> about it,
<emph>all</emph>, and said that it
was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice. Then he got up
and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did he despise me?
Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise me
or not?</q> She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me,</q> Alyosha asked anxiously, <q>did you send for that
person?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I did.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you send him a letter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Simply to ask about that, about that child?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about
that at once. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That person behaved honorably,</q> Alyosha murmured.
</p>

<p>
<q>And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple
<foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign> himself.
He is very ill now, too, Lise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he does believe in it,</q> said Lise, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>He doesn't despise any one,</q> Alyosha went on. <q>Only he does not
believe any one. If he doesn't believe in people, of course, he does
despise them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he despises me, me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good,</q> Lise seemed to grind her teeth. <q>When he went out
laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised. The child with
fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice....</q>
</p>

<p>
And she laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like&mdash;Alyosha,
save me!</q> She suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and
seized him with both hands. <q>Save me!</q> she almost groaned. <q>Is
there any one in the world I could tell what I've told you? I've
told you the truth, the truth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe
<pb n='660'/><anchor id='Pg660'/>
everything! I don't want to live, because I loathe everything! I
loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you love me in
the least?</q> she finished in a frenzy.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I do love you!</q> answered Alyosha warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And will you weep over me, will you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you! It's only your tears I want. Every one else may
punish me and trample me under foot, every one, every one, not
excepting <emph>any one</emph>. For I don't love any one. Do you hear, not any
one! On the contrary, I hate him! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went
to your brother</q>; she tore herself away from him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I leave you like this?</q> said Alyosha, almost in alarm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here's your hat.
Give my love to Mitya, go, go!</q>
</p>

<p>
And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He
looked at her with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of
a letter in his right hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed.
He glanced at it and instantly read the address, <q>To Ivan Fyodorovitch
Karamazov.</q> He looked quickly at Lise. Her face had
become almost menacing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Give it to him, you must give it to him!</q> she ordered him,
trembling and beside herself. <q>To-day, at once, or I'll poison myself!
That's why I sent for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha
put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without
going back to Madame Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon
as Alyosha had gone, Lise unbolted the door, opened it a little, put
her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might,
pinching her finger. Ten seconds after, releasing her finger, she
walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat up straight in it and looked
intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from
under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept whispering
rapidly to herself:
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter IV. A Hymn And A Secret</head>

<p>
It was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha
rang at the prison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But
Alyosha knew that he would be admitted without difficulty. Things
were managed in our little town, as everywhere else. At first, of
course, on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, relations and
a few other persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going
through certain inevitable formalities. But later, though the
formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at
least, of Mitya's visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews
with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were
practically <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tête-à-tête</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka,
Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the
police, Mihail Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka.
His abuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man's
conscience, and when he learned the whole story, he completely
changed his view of her. And strange to say, though he was
firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in prison,
the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him.
<q>He was a man of good heart, perhaps,</q> he thought, <q>who had
come to grief from drinking and dissipation.</q> His first horror had
been succeeded by pity. As for Alyosha, the police captain was
very fond of him and had known him for a long time. Rakitin,
who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner,
was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the <q>police captain's
young ladies,</q> as he called them, and was always hanging about
their house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent,
too, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his
duties, was a kind-hearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate
acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent, who
was fond of talking to him, generally on sacred subjects. He respected
Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in awe of his opinion, though
he was a great philosopher himself; <q>self-taught,</q> of course. But
<pb n='662'/><anchor id='Pg662'/>
Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him. During the last year
the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal Gospels, and
constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend. He
used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours
together with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were
late at the prison, he had only to go to the superintendent and
everything was made easy. Besides, every one in the prison, down
to the humblest warder, had grown used to Alyosha. The sentry,
of course, did not trouble him so long as the authorities were
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs,
to the place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the
room he came upon Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya.
They were both talking loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he
saw him out, while Rakitin seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like
meeting Alyosha, especially of late. He scarcely spoke to him, and
bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha enter now, he frowned and
looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his
big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at once
for his umbrella.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must mind not to forget my belongings,</q> he muttered, simply
to say something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mind you don't forget other people's belongings,</q> said Mitya, as
a joke, and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up
instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better give that advice to your own family, who've
always been a slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,</q> he cried, suddenly
trembling with anger.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter? I was joking,</q> cried Mitya. <q>Damn it all!
They are all like that,</q> he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards
Rakitin's hurriedly retreating figure. <q>He was sitting here, laughing
and cheerful, and all at once he boils up like that. He didn't
even nod to you. Have you broken with him completely? Why
are you so late? I've not been simply waiting, but thirsting for you
the whole morning. But never mind. We'll make up for it now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great
friends?</q> asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through
which Rakitin had disappeared.
</p>

<pb n='663'/><anchor id='Pg663'/>

<p>
<q>Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it
likely&mdash;a pig like that? He considers I am ... a blackguard.
They can't understand a joke either, that's the worst of such people.
They never understand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat;
they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here. But
he is a clever fellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it's all over with
me now.</q>
</p>

<p>
He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?</q>
Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you talking about?</q> said Mitya, looking at him rather
uncertainly. <q>Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now
we've been talking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but
I haven't said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial
is to-morrow; but it wasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was
all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean, Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ethics?</q> asked Alyosha, wondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; is it a science?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can't
explain to you what sort of science it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He's not
going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he'll
go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may
be of use and make his own career, too. Ough! they are first-rate,
these people, at making a career! Damn ethics, I am done for,
Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than any one. It
makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Karl Bernard?</q> Alyosha was surprised again.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What
was he? Chemist or what?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He must be a savant,</q> answered Alyosha; <q>but I confess I can't
tell you much about him, either. I've heard of him as a savant,
but what sort I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, damn him, then! I don't know either,</q> swore Mitya.
<q>A scoundrel of some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels.
And Rakitin will make his way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he
<pb n='664'/><anchor id='Pg664'/>
is another Bernard. Ugh, these Bernards! They are all over the
place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what is the matter?</q> Alyosha asked insistently.
</p>

<p>
<q>He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so
begin his literary career. That's what he comes for; he said so
himself. He wants to prove some theory. He wants to say <q>he
couldn't help murdering his father, he was corrupted by his environment,</q>
and so on. He explained it all to me. He is going to put
in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn the fellow, he can
put in a tinge if he likes, I don't care. He can't bear Ivan, he hates
him. He's not fond of you, either. But I don't turn him out, for
he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to him
just now, <q>The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers;
for all true Russians are philosophers, and though you've studied,
you are not a philosopher&mdash;you are a low fellow.</q> He laughed, so
maliciously. And I said to him, <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>De
ideabus non est disputandum</foreign>.</q>
Isn't that rather good? I can set up for being a classic, you see!</q>
Mitya laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,</q> Alyosha
interposed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is it all over with me? H'm!... The fact of it is ...
if you take it as a whole, I am sorry to lose God&mdash;that's why it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>sorry to lose God</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head&mdash;that is, these nerves
are there in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little
tails, the little tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ...
that is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and
then they begin quivering, those little tails ... and when they
quiver, then an image appears ... it doesn't appear at once, but
an instant, a second, passes ... and then something like a moment
appears; that is, not a moment&mdash;devil take the moment!&mdash;but an
image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it! That's why I see
and then think, because of those tails, not at all because I've got a
soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness. All that is nonsense!
Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother, and it
simply bowled me over. It's magnificent, Alyosha, this science! A
new man's arising&mdash;that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to
lose God!</q>
</p>

<pb n='665'/><anchor id='Pg665'/>

<p>
<q>Well, that's a good thing, anyway,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I am sorry to lose God? It's chemistry, brother, chemistry!
There's no help for it, your reverence, you must make way
for chemistry. And Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn't he
dislike Him! That's the sore point with all of them. But they
conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend. <q>Will you preach this
in your reviews?</q> I asked him. <q>Oh, well, if I did it openly, they
won't let it through,</q> he said. He laughed. <q>But what will become
of men then?</q> I asked him, <q>without God and immortal life? All
things are lawful then, they can do what they like?</q> <q>Didn't you
know?</q> he said laughing, <q>a clever man can do what he likes,</q> he
said. <q>A clever man knows his way about, but you've put your foot
in it, committing a murder, and now you are rotting in prison.</q> He
says that to my face! A regular pig! I used to kick such people
out, but now I listen to them. He talks a lot of sense, too. Writes
well. He began reading me an article last week. I copied out three
lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and
read:
</p>

<p>
<q><q>In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to
put one's personality in contradiction to one's reality.</q> Do you understand
that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't,</q> said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to
him with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand either. It's dark and obscure, but intellectual.
<q>Every one writes like that now,</q> he says, <q>it's the effect
of their environment.</q> They are afraid of the environment. He
writes poetry, too, the rascal. He's written in honor of Madame
Hohlakov's foot. Ha ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've heard about it,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you? And have you heard the poem?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I've got it. Here it is. I'll read it to you. You don't know&mdash;I
haven't told you&mdash;there's quite a story about it. He's a rascal!
Three weeks ago he began to tease me. <q>You've got yourself into a
mess, like a fool, for the sake of three thousand, but I'm going to
collar a hundred and fifty thousand. I am going to marry a widow
and buy a house in Petersburg.</q> And he told me he was courting
<pb n='666'/><anchor id='Pg666'/>
Madame Hohlakov. She hadn't much brains in her youth, and now
at forty she has lost what she had. <q>But she's awfully sentimental,</q>
he says; <q>that's how I shall get hold of her. When I marry her, I
shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.</q>
And his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow,
but for the hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe
it. He came to see me every day. <q>She is coming round,</q> he declared.
He was beaming with delight. And then, all of a sudden,
he was turned out of the house. Perhotin's carrying everything
before him, bravo! I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him
out of the house. And he had written this doggerel. <q>It's the first
time I've soiled my hands with writing poetry,</q> he said. <q>It's to
win her heart, so it's in a good cause. When I get hold of the silly
woman's fortune, I can be of great social utility.</q> They have this
social justification for every nasty thing they do! <q>Anyway it's
better than your Pushkin's poetry,</q> he said, <q>for I've managed to
advocate enlightenment even in that.</q> I understand what he means
about Pushkin, I quite see that, if he really was a man of talent
and only wrote about women's feet. But wasn't Rakitin stuck up
about his doggerel! The vanity of these fellows! <q>On the convalescence
of the swollen foot of the object of my affections</q>&mdash;he
thought of that for a title. He's a waggish fellow.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>A captivating little foot,</l>
<l>Though swollen and red and tender!</l>
<l>The doctors come and plasters put,</l>
<l>But still they cannot mend her.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet, 'tis not for her foot I dread&mdash;</l>
<l>A theme for Pushkin's muse more fit&mdash;</l>
<l>It's not her foot, it is her head:</l>
<l>I tremble for her loss of wit!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>For as her foot swells, strange to say,</l>
<l>Her intellect is on the wane&mdash;</l>
<l>Oh, for some remedy I pray</l>
<l>That may restore both foot and brain!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>He is a pig, a regular pig, but he's very arch, the rascal! And he
really has put in a progressive idea. And wasn't he angry when
she kicked him out! He was gnashing his teeth!</q>
</p>

<pb n='667'/><anchor id='Pg667'/>

<p>
<q>He's taken his revenge already,</q> said Alyosha. <q>He's written
a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's his doing, that's his doing!</q> Mitya assented, frowning.
<q>That's him! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting
things that have been written about Grushenka, for instance....
And about Katya, too.... H'm!</q>
</p>

<p>
He walked across the room with a harassed air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, I cannot stay long,</q> Alyosha said, after a pause. <q>To-morrow
will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God
will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here,
talking of I don't know what ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, don't be amazed at me,</q> Mitya broke in warmly. <q>Am I
to talk of that stinking dog? Of the murderer? We've talked
enough of him. I don't want to say more of the stinking son of
Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you will see. Hush!</q>
</p>

<p>
He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes
glowed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rakitin wouldn't understand it,</q> he began in a sort of exaltation;
<q>but you, you'll understand it all. That's why I was thirsting
for you. You see, there's so much I've been wanting to tell you
for ever so long, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven't said
a word about what matters most; the moment never seems to have
come. Now I can wait no longer. I must pour out my heart to
you. Brother, these last two months I've found in myself a new
man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me, but
would never have come to the surface, if it hadn't been for this
blow from heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend
twenty years in the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not
a bit afraid of that&mdash;it's something else I am afraid of now: that
that new man may leave me. Even there, in the mines, under-ground,
I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer
by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even there one
may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen
heart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last
bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature;
one may bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are
so many of them, hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for
<pb n='668'/><anchor id='Pg668'/>
them. Why was it I dreamed of that <q>babe</q> at such a moment?
<q>Why is the babe so poor?</q> That was a sign to me at that moment.
It's for the babe I'm going. Because we are all responsible for all.
For all the <q>babes,</q> for there are big children as well as little children.
All are <q>babes.</q> I go for all, because some one must go for all. I
didn't kill father, but I've got to go. I accept it. It's all come
to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are numbers of
them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their
hands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom,
but then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without
which man cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it's His
privilege&mdash;a grand one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer!
What should I be underground there without God? Rakitin's
laughing! If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter Him
underground. One cannot exist in prison without God; it's even
more impossible than out of prison. And then we men underground
will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to
God, with Whom is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech.
He turned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,</q> he began again.
<q>You wouldn't believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a
thirst for existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within
these peeling walls. Rakitin doesn't understand that; all he cares
about is building a house and letting flats. But I've been longing
for you. And what is suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it
were beyond reckoning. I am not afraid of it now. I was afraid of
it before. Do you know, perhaps I won't answer at the trial at all....
And I seem to have such strength in me now, that I think I
could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to
repeat to myself every moment, <q>I exist.</q> In thousands of agonies&mdash;I
exist. I'm tormented on the rack&mdash;but I exist! Though I sit
alone on a pillar&mdash;I exist! I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun,
I know it's there. And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that
the sun is there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the
death of me. Damn them! Brother Ivan&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of brother Ivan?</q> interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did
not hear.
</p>

<pb n='669'/><anchor id='Pg669'/>

<p>
<q>You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all
hidden away in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not
understand were surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight
and rage. It was to stifle them in myself, to still them, to smother
them. Ivan is not Rakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx
and is silent; he is always silent. It's God that's worrying me.
That's the only thing that's worrying me. What if He doesn't
exist? What if Rakitin's right&mdash;that it's an idea made up by men?
Then if He doesn't exist, man is the chief of the earth, of the universe.
Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good without
God? That's the question. I always come back to that. For whom
is man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To
whom will he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that
one can love humanity without God. Well, only a sniveling idiot
can maintain that. I can't understand it. Life's easy for Rakitin.
<q>You'd better think about the extension of civic rights, or even
of keeping down the price of meat. You will show your love for
humanity more simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.</q>
I answered him, <q>Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to
raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every
copeck.</q> He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness?
Answer me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another
with a Chinaman, so it's a relative thing. Or isn't it? Is it not
relative? A treacherous question! You won't laugh if I tell you it's
kept me awake two nights. I only wonder now how people can
live and think nothing about it. Vanity! Ivan has no God. He has
an idea. It's beyond me. But he is silent. I believe he is a free-mason.
I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted to drink from the
springs of his soul&mdash;he was silent. But once he did drop a word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he say?</q> Alyosha took it up quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I said to him, <q>Then everything is lawful, if it is so?</q> He
frowned. <q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,</q> he said, <q>was a pig, but
his ideas were right enough.</q> That was what he dropped. That
was all he said. That was going one better than Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Alyosha assented bitterly. <q>When was he with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said
nothing about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When
my business here is over and the verdict has been given, then I'll
<pb n='670'/><anchor id='Pg670'/>
tell you something. I'll tell you everything. We've something tremendous
on hand.... And you shall be my judge in it. But
don't begin about that now; be silent. You talk of to-morrow, of
the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you talked to the counsel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He's
a soft, city-bred rogue&mdash;a Bernard! But he doesn't believe me&mdash;not
a bit of it. Only imagine, he believes I did it. I see it. <q>In that
case,</q> I asked him, <q>why have you come to defend me?</q> Hang them
all! They've got a doctor down, too, want to prove I'm mad. I
won't have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to do her <q>duty</q> to the
end, whatever the strain!</q> Mitya smiled bitterly. <q>The cat! Hard-hearted
creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroe that she
was a woman of <q>great wrath.</q> They repeated it. Yes, the facts
against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory
sticks to his point. Grigory's honest, but a fool. Many people are
honest because they are fools: that's Rakitin's idea. Grigory's my
enemy. And there are some people who are better as foes than
friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna. I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she
will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand.
She'll pay it back to the last farthing. I don't want her sacrifice;
they'll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I can stand it.
Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the court, can't
you? But damn it all, it doesn't matter! I shall get through somehow.
I don't pity her. It's her own doing. She deserves what she
gets. I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.</q> He smiled bitterly
again. <q>Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why
should she have such suffering to bear?</q> he exclaimed suddenly,
with tears. <q>Grusha's killing me; the thought of her's killing me,
killing me. She was with me just now....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I
kissed her as she was going. I didn't ask her forgiveness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didn't you?</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness
for a fault from a woman you love. From one you love especially,
however greatly you may have been in fault. For a woman&mdash;devil
<pb n='671'/><anchor id='Pg671'/>
only knows what to make of a woman! I know something about
them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman.
Say, <q>I am sorry, forgive me,</q> and a shower of reproaches will follow!
Nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly, she'll
humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have never happened,
recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her own,
and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do
it. She'll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head.
They are ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all
these angels without whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and
openly, dear boy, every decent man ought to be under some woman's
thumb. That's my conviction&mdash;not conviction, but feeling. A
man ought to be magnanimous, and it's no disgrace to a man! No
disgrace to a hero, not even a Cæsar! But don't ever beg her pardon
all the same for anything. Remember that rule given you by
your brother Mitya, who's come to ruin through women. No, I'd
better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I
worship her, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn't see it. No,
she still thinks I don't love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures
me with her love. The past was nothing! In the past it was
only those infernal curves of hers that tortured me, but now I've
taken all her soul into my soul and through her I've become a man
myself. Will they marry us? If they don't, I shall die of jealousy.
I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you
about me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya
listened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then she is not angry at my being jealous?</q> he exclaimed.
<q>She is a regular woman! <q>I've a fierce heart myself!</q> Ah, I love
such fierce hearts, though I can't bear any one's being jealous of me.
I can't endure it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her
infinitely. Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry?
That's the question. And without her I can't exist....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark.
He suddenly seemed terribly worried.
</p>

<p>
<q>So there's a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot
against her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good
Grushenka, that's not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your
<pb n='672'/><anchor id='Pg672'/>
foolish feminine way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I'll tell
you our secret!</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was
standing before him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery,
though in reality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing
in the corner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers
on guard.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will tell you all our secret,</q> Mitya whispered hurriedly. <q>I
meant to tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without
you? You are everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior
to us, you are my angel. It's your decision will decide it.
Perhaps it's you that is superior and not Ivan. You see, it's a question
of conscience, question of the higher conscience&mdash;the secret is
so important that I can't settle it myself, and I've put it off till I
could speak to you. But anyway it's too early to decide now, for
we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you
shall decide my fate. Don't decide it now. I'll tell you now. You
listen, but don't decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won't tell you
everything. I'll only tell you the idea, without details, and you
keep quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But,
goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I'm afraid your eyes
will tell me your decision, even if you don't speak. Oo! I'm afraid!
Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my <emph>escaping</emph>. I won't tell you the
details: it's all been thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don't
decide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can't
live without Grusha! What if they won't let her follow me to
Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And
without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer?
I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the
other hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering.
A sign has come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I
turn my back on it. Ivan says that in America, <q>with the good-will,</q>
I can be of more use than underground. But what becomes
of our hymn from underground? What's America? America is
vanity again! And there's a lot of swindling in America, too, I
expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell you, you
know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand
this. There's no one else. It's folly, madness to others, all I've told
<pb n='673'/><anchor id='Pg673'/>
you of the hymn. They'll say I'm out of my mind or a fool. I am
not out of my mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about
the hymn, too. He understands, only he doesn't answer&mdash;he doesn't
speak. He doesn't believe in the hymn. Don't speak, don't speak.
I see how you look! You have already decided. Don't decide, spare
me! I can't live without Grusha. Wait till after the trial!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands
on his shoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his
brother's.
</p>

<p>
<q>They don't let convicts marry, do they?</q> he repeated for the
third time in a supplicating voice.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me one thing,</q> he said. <q>Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose
idea was it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn't come to see me at
first, then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it
straight away. He is awfully keen on it. He doesn't ask me, but
orders me to escape. He doesn't doubt of my obeying him, though
I showed him all my heart as I have to you, and told him about the
hymn, too. He told me he'd arrange it; he's found out about everything.
But of that later. He's simply set on it. It's all a matter
of money: he'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty
thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificent
escape for ten thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And he told you on no account to tell me?</q> Alyosha asked
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you.
He is afraid, no doubt, that you'll stand before me as my conscience.
Don't tell him I told you. Don't tell him, for anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right,</q> Alyosha pronounced; <q>it's impossible to decide
anything before the trial is over. After the trial you'll decide of
yourself. Then you'll find that new man in yourself and he will
decide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A new man, or a Bernard who'll decide <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
la</foreign> Bernard, for I believe
I'm a contemptible Bernard myself,</q> said Mitya, with a bitter
grin.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head.
<pb n='674'/><anchor id='Pg674'/>
<q>Alyosha, darling, it's time you were going,</q> he said, with a sudden
haste. <q>There's the superintendent shouting in the yard. He'll
be here directly. We are late; it's irregular. Embrace me quickly.
Kiss me! Sign me with the cross, darling, for the cross I have to
bear to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
They embraced and kissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan,</q> said Mitya suddenly, <q>suggests my escaping; but, of
course, he believes I did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
A mournful smile came on to his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you asked him whether he believes it?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I haven't. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I hadn't the
courage. But I saw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going
out, when Mitya suddenly called him back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stand facing me! That's right!</q> And again he seized Alyosha,
putting both hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly
quite pale, so that it was dreadfully apparent, even through the
gathering darkness. His lips twitched, his eyes fastened upon
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do
you believe I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The
whole truth, don't lie!</q> he cried desperately.
</p>

<p>
Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something
like a stab at his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush! What do you mean?</q> he faltered helplessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>The whole truth, the whole, don't lie!</q> repeated Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!</q>
broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha's breast, and he
raised his right hand in the air, as though calling God to witness
his words.
</p>

<p>
Mitya's whole face was lighted up with bliss.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you!</q> he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh
escape him after fainting. <q>Now you have given me new life.
Would you believe it, till this moment I've been afraid to ask you,
you, even you. Well, go! You've given me strength for to-morrow.
God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!</q> was Mitya's
last word.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such
<pb n='675'/><anchor id='Pg675'/>
lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha&mdash;all this suddenly opened
before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair
in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion
overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn
heart. <q>Love Ivan!</q>&mdash;he suddenly recalled Mitya's words. And
he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He
was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than
ever now.

<head>Chapter V. Not You, Not You!</head>

<p>
On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina
Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He
suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina
Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan
might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing,
and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese
lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized
him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina
Ivanovna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, it's only you,</q> said Ivan dryly. <q>Well, good-by! You are
going to her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't advise you to; she's upset and you'll upset her more.</q>
</p>

<p>
A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I have been with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan
Fyodorovitch, you must come back, you must. Do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
There was such a peremptory note in Katya's voice that Ivan,
after a moment's hesitation, made up his mind to go back with
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>She was listening,</q> he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha
heard it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,</q> said Ivan, going into the
<pb n='676'/><anchor id='Pg676'/>
drawing-room. <q>I won't sit down. I won't stay more than a
minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> said Katerina Ivanovna, though
she remained standing. She had changed very little during this time,
but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered
afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome
at that moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he ask you to tell me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only one thing,</q> said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face,
<q>that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what</q>
(he was a little confused) <q>... passed between you ... at the
time of your first acquaintance ... in that town.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!</q> She
broke into a bitter laugh. <q>Why, is he afraid for me or for himself?
He asks me to spare&mdash;whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey
Fyodorovitch!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Both yourself and him,</q> he answered softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad to hear it,</q> she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly
blushed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she said menacingly.
<q>And I don't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to
trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will give your evidence honorably,</q> said Alyosha; <q>that's
all that's wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Women are often dishonorable,</q> she snarled. <q>Only an hour
ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as
though he were a reptile ... but no, he is still a human being to
me! But did he do it? Is he the murderer?</q> she cried, all of a
sudden, hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once
that she had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment
before he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth,
and that they had ended by quarreling.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded
me that he murdered his father. It's only you I believed!</q>
she continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained
smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such
familiar intimacy between them.
</p>

<pb n='677'/><anchor id='Pg677'/>

<p>
<q>Well, that's enough, anyway,</q> Ivan cut short the conversation.
<q>I am going. I'll come to-morrow.</q> And turning at once, he
walked out of the room and went straight downstairs.
</p>

<p>
With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by
both hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Follow him! Overtake him! Don't leave him alone for a minute!</q>
she said, in a hurried whisper. <q>He's mad! Don't you know
that he's mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me
so. Go, run after him....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces
ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q> He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing
that he was running after him. <q>She told you to catch me up,
because I'm mad. I know it all by heart,</q> he added irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,</q>
said Alyosha. <q>I was looking at your face just now. You look very
ill, Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out
of their mind?</q> Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a
trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,</q>
Alyosha answered with surprise.
</p>

<p>
Ivan paused for half a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,</q> he said
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,</q> said Alyosha
timidly, and he took Lise's note from his pocket and held it out to
Ivan. They were just under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the
handwriting at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, from that little demon!</q> he laughed maliciously, and, without
opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the
air. The bits were scattered by the wind.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,</q> he
said contemptuously, striding along the street again.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean, offering herself?</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='678'/><anchor id='Pg678'/>

<p>
<q>As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you, Ivan, how can you?</q> Alyosha cried warmly, in a
grieved voice. <q>She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill;
she is very ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps....
I had hoped to hear something from you ... that would
save her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her
nurse. Be quiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her. I am not even
thinking about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were silent again for a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show
her how to act to-morrow at the trial,</q> he said sharply and angrily
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Whether she's to save Mitya or ruin him. She'll pray
for light from above. She can't make up her mind for herself, you
see. She has not had time to decide yet. She takes me for her
nurse, too. She wants me to sing lullabies to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,</q> said Alyosha sadly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her
that give her hope?</q> Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. <q>I
know that you've given her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you
like this,</q> he added.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't behave to her as I ought&mdash;break off altogether and tell
her so straight out,</q> said Ivan, irritably. <q>I must wait till sentence
is passed on the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will
avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the
trial, for she hates him and knows she hates him. It's all a lie&mdash;lie
upon lie! As long as I don't break off with her, she goes on
hoping, and she won't ruin that monster, knowing how I want to
get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would come!</q>
</p>

<p>
The words <q>murderer</q> and <q>monster</q> echoed painfully in Alyosha's
heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can she ruin Mitya?</q> he asked, pondering on Ivan's
words. <q>What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know that yet. She's got a document in her hands,
in Mitya's own writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder
Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q>
</p>

<pb n='679'/><anchor id='Pg679'/>

<p>
<q>That's impossible!</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is it impossible? I've read it myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There can't be such a document!</q> Alyosha repeated warmly.
<q>There can't be, because he's not the murderer. It's not he murdered
father, not he!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan suddenly stopped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is the murderer then, according to you?</q> he asked, with
apparent coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know who,</q> Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating
voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,
Smerdyakov?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know who,</q> broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely
breathe.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who? Who?</q> Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly
vanished.
</p>

<p>
<q>I only know one thing,</q> Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper,
<q><emph>it wasn't you</emph> killed father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Not you</q>! What do you mean by <q>not you</q>?</q> Ivan was
thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not you killed father, not you!</q> Alyosha repeated firmly.
</p>

<p>
The silence lasted for half a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know I didn't. Are you raving?</q> said Ivan, with a pale, distorted
smile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing
again under a lamp-post.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are
the murderer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said
so?</q> Ivan faltered helplessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone
during these two dreadful months,</q> Alyosha went on softly and
distinctly as before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of
himself, not of his own will, but obeying some irresistible command.
<q>You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you
are the murderer and no one else. But you didn't do it: you are
mistaken: you are not the murderer. Do you hear? It was not
you! God has sent me to tell you so.</q>
</p>

<pb n='680'/><anchor id='Pg680'/>

<p>
They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute.
They were both standing still, gazing into each other's eyes. They
were both pale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and
clutched Alyosha's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've been in my room!</q> he whispered hoarsely. <q>You've
been there at night, when he came.... Confess ... have you
seen him, have you seen him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whom do you mean&mdash;Mitya?</q> Alyosha asked, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not him, damn the monster!</q> Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. <q>Do
you know that he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is <emph>he</emph>! I don't know whom you are talking about,</q>
Alyosha faltered, beginning to be alarmed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you do know ... or how could you&mdash;? It's impossible
that you don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed
to reflect. A strange grin contorted his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, <q>I have said
this to you, because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell you
once and for all, it's not you. You hear, once for all! God has
put it into my heart to say this to you, even though it may make
you hate me from this hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> he said, with a cold smile, <q>I can't endure
prophets and epileptics&mdash;messengers from God especially&mdash;and you
know that only too well. I break off all relations with you from
this moment and probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this
turning. It's the way to your lodgings, too. You'd better be particularly
careful not to come to me to-day! Do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> Alyosha called after him, <q>if anything happens to you
to-day, turn to me before any one!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at
the cross roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he
turned and walked slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan
were living in lodgings; neither of them was willing to live in
Fyodor Pavlovitch's empty house. Alyosha had a furnished room in
the house of some working people. Ivan lived some distance from
him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached
<pb n='681'/><anchor id='Pg681'/>
to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of
an official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old
crone who went to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at
six in the morning. Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his
comforts of late, and very fond of being alone. He did everything
for himself in the one room he lived in, and rarely entered any of the
other rooms in his abode.
</p>

<p>
He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell,
when he suddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over
with anger. Suddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a
curse, and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction. He
walked a mile and a half to a tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a
hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the neighbor who used to come
to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov
had once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was now lodging.
She had sold their little house, and was now living here with her
mother. Smerdyakov, who was ill&mdash;almost dying&mdash;had been with
them ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch's death. It was to him Ivan
was going now, drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting.

<head>Chapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov
since his return from Moscow. The first time he had seen him
and talked to him was on the first day of his arrival, then he had
visited him once more, a fortnight later. But his visits had ended
with that second one, so that it was now over a month since he had
seen him. And he had scarcely heard anything of him.
</p>

<p>
Ivan had only returned five days after his father's death, so that
he was not present at the funeral, which took place the day before
he came back. The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing
his Moscow address, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph
to him, and she, not knowing his address either, telegraphed
to her sister and aunt, reckoning on Ivan's going to see them as soon
as he arrived in Moscow. But he did not go to them till four days

after his arrival. When he got the telegram, he had, of course,
set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him was Alyosha,
and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to the
general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion
against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer.
Later on, after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and
hearing the details of the charge and the arrest, he was still more
surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated
brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha,
as Ivan knew, was very fond.
</p>

<p>
By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his
brother Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes
a compassion for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt,
almost repugnance. Mitya's whole personality, even his appearance,
was extremely unattractive to him. Ivan looked with
indignation on Katerina Ivanovna's love for his brother. Yet he
went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and that interview,
far from shaking Ivan's belief in his guilt, positively strengthened
it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya
had been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He
used violent language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled.
He talked principally about the three thousand roubles, which
he said had been <q>stolen</q> from him by his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>The money was mine, it was my money,</q> Mitya kept repeating.
<q>Even if I had stolen it, I should have had the right.</q>
</p>

<p>
He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to
turn a fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent
way. He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any
one else. Quite the contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful
of the charges against him; he was continually firing up and abusing
every one. He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory's evidence
about the open door, and declared that it was <q>the devil that opened
it.</q> But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of
the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first
interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared
that <q>everything was lawful,</q> to suspect and question him.
Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.

Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for
the first time to see Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking
of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening
before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling
and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating
lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He
put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in
the hospital.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the
hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan's persistent questions,
that Smerdyakov's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and
were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have
been shamming on the day of the catastrophe. They gave him to
understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting
and recurring several times, so that the patient's life was positively
in danger, and it was only now, after they had applied remedies,
that they could assert with confidence that the patient would
survive. <q>Though it might well be,</q> added Doctor Herzenstube,
<q>that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period, if not
permanently.</q> On Ivan's asking impatiently whether that meant
that he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case,
in the full sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were
perceptible. Ivan decided to find out for himself what those
abnormalities were.
</p>

<p>
At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov
was lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was
only one other bed in the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the
town, swollen with dropsy, who was obviously almost dying; he
could be no hindrance to their conversation. Smerdyakov grinned
uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the first instant seemed nervous.
So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only momentary. For the
rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by Smerdyakov's
composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he was
