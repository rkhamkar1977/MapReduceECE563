that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka
had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had
given evidence against Mitya, and so she was angry. The whole
<pb n='775'/><anchor id='Pg775'/>
effect on the public, of Rakitin's speech, of his noble sentiments, of
his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was
this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another
godsend. Grushenka's cross-examination did not last long and, of
course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence.
She left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of
contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her
evidence and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from
Katerina Ivanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He
sat as though turned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Ivan was called to give evidence.

<head>Chapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe</head>

<p>
I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the
usher of the court announced to the President that, owing to an
attack of illness or some sort of fit, the witness could not appear
at the moment, but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he
recovered. But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out
later.
</p>

<p>
His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The
principal witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been
questioned. Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling
almost fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard,
who probably had little information to give after all that had been
given. Time was passing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness,
looking at no one, and with his head bowed, as though plunged
in gloomy thought. He was irreproachably dressed, but his face
made a painful impression, on me at least: there was an earthy look
in it, a look like a dying man's. His eyes were lusterless; he raised
them and looked slowly round the court. Alyosha jumped up from
his seat and moaned <q>Ah!</q> I remember that, but it was hardly
noticed.
</p>

<p>
The President began by informing him that he was a witness not
on oath, that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of
<pb n='776'/><anchor id='Pg776'/>
course, he must bear witness according to his conscience, and so on,
and so on. Ivan listened and looked at him blankly, but his face
gradually relaxed into a smile, and as soon as the President, looking
at him in astonishment, finished, he laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, and what else?</q> he asked in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something
strange. The President showed signs of uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ... are perhaps still unwell?</q> he began, looking everywhere
for the usher.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and
can tell you something interesting,</q> Ivan answered with sudden
calmness and respectfulness.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have some special communication to make?</q> the President
went on, still mistrustfully.
</p>

<p>
Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head,
answered, almost stammering:
</p>

<p>
<q>No ... I haven't. I have nothing particular.</q>
</p>

<p>
They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,
with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew
more and more marked, though he answered rationally. To many
questions he answered that he did not know. He knew nothing of
his father's money relations with Dmitri. <q>I wasn't interested in
the subject,</q> he added. Threats to murder his father he had heard
from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he had heard
from Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>The same thing over and over again,</q> he interrupted suddenly,
with a look of weariness. <q>I have nothing particular to tell the
court.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,</q> the President
began.
</p>

<p>
He turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to
invite them to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly
asked in an exhausted voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
And with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned
to walk out of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still,
as though he had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know.
<pb n='777'/><anchor id='Pg777'/>
How does it go? <q>I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.</q>
They were trying to put on her sarafan to take her to church to be
married, and she said, <q>I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.</q>...
It's in some book about the peasantry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by that?</q> the President asked severely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, this,</q> Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. <q>Here's
the money ... the notes that lay in that envelope</q> (he nodded
towards the table on which lay the material evidence), <q>for the
sake of which our father was murdered. Where shall I put them?
Mr. Superintendent, take them.</q>
</p>

<p>
The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the
President.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could this money have come into your possession if it is
the same money?</q> the President asked wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday....
I was with him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not
my brother, killed our father. He murdered him and I incited him
to do it ... Who doesn't desire his father's death?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you in your right mind?</q> broke involuntarily from the
President.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty
mind as all of you ... as all these ... ugly faces.</q> He turned
suddenly to the audience. <q>My father has been murdered and they
pretend they are horrified,</q> he snarled, with furious contempt.
<q>They keep up the sham with one another. Liars! They all desire
the death of their fathers. One reptile devours another.... If
there hadn't been a murder, they'd have been angry and gone home
ill-humored. It's a spectacle they want! <foreign rend='italic'>Panem
et circenses</foreign>.
Though I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink
for Christ's sake!</q> He suddenly clutched his head.
</p>

<p>
The usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and
cried, <q>He is ill. Don't believe him: he has brain fever.</q> Katerina
Ivanovna rose impulsively from her seat and, rigid with horror,
gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and greedily looked at his brother
and listened to him with a wild, strange smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,</q>
Ivan began again. <q>You can't expect eloquence from a murderer,</q>
he added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh.
</p>

<pb n='778'/><anchor id='Pg778'/>

<p>
The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay.
The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch
pricked up his ears as he listened: the hall was hushed in
expectation. The President seemed suddenly to recollect himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here.
Calm yourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really
have something to tell. How can you confirm your statement ...
if indeed you are not delirious?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won't
send you proofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You
think of nothing but envelopes&mdash;one is enough. I've no witnesses ...
except one, perhaps,</q> he smiled thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is your witness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular!
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Le diable n'existe point!</foreign>
Don't pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful
devil,</q> he added suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were,
confidentially. <q>He is here somewhere, no doubt&mdash;under that table
with the material evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if
not there? You see, listen to me. I told him I don't want to keep
quiet, and he talked about the geological cataclysm ... idiocy!
Come, release the monster ... he's been singing a hymn. That's
because his heart is light! It's like a drunken man in the street
bawling how <q>Vanka went to Petersburg,</q> and I would give a quadrillion
quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You don't know me!
Oh, how stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him!
I didn't come for nothing.... Why, why is everything so
stupid?...</q>
</p>

<p>
And he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round
him again. But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha
rushed towards him, but the court usher had already seized Ivan
by the arm.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you about?</q> he cried, staring into the man's face,
and suddenly seizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently
to the floor. But the police were on the spot and he was seized.
He screamed furiously. And all the time he was being removed,
he yelled and screamed something incoherent.
</p>

<p>
The whole court was thrown into confusion. I don't remember
everything as it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow.
<pb n='779'/><anchor id='Pg779'/>
I only know that afterwards, when everything was quiet again
and every one understood what had happened, the court usher came
in for a reprimand, though he very reasonably explained that the
witness had been quite well, that the doctor had seen him an hour
ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but that, until he had
come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively, so that nothing
could have been foreseen&mdash;that he had, in fact, insisted on giving
evidence. But before every one had completely regained their composure
and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another.
Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking
loudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them
not to remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:
</p>

<p>
<q>There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here
is a document, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It's
a letter from that monster ... that man there, there!</q> she pointed
to Mitya. <q>It was he killed his father, you will see that directly.
He wrote to me how he would kill his father! But the other one is
ill, he is ill, he is delirious!</q> she kept crying out, beside herself.
</p>

<p>
The court usher took the document she held out to the President,
and she, dropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands,
began convulsively and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and
stifling every sound for fear she should be ejected from the court.
The document she had handed up was that letter Mitya had written
at the <q>Metropolis</q> tavern, which Ivan had spoken of as a <q>mathematical
proof.</q> Alas! its mathematical conclusiveness was recognized,
and had it not been for that letter, Mitya might have escaped
his doom or, at least, that doom would have been less terrible. It
was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What followed is still
confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, have at once
passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on
both sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness.
On being gently asked by the President whether she had recovered
sufficiently, Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:
</p>

<p>
<q>I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,</q>
she added, evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented
from giving evidence. She was asked to explain in detail
what this letter was and under what circumstances she received it.
</p>

<p>
<q>I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he
<pb n='780'/><anchor id='Pg780'/>
wrote it the day before that, at the tavern&mdash;that is, two days before
he committed the crime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!</q>
she cried breathlessly. <q>He hated me at that time, because he had
behaved contemptibly and was running after that creature ... and
because he owed me that three thousand.... Oh! he was humiliated
by that three thousand on account of his own meanness! This
is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg you, I beseech
you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father, he
came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and
what he wanted it for. Yes, yes&mdash;to win that creature and carry
her off. I knew then that he had been false to me and meant to
abandon me, and it was I, I, who gave him that money, who offered
it to him on the pretext of his sending it to my sister in Moscow.
And as I gave it him, I looked him in the face and said that he could
send it when he liked, <q>in a month's time would do.</q> How, how
could he have failed to understand that I was practically telling him
to his face, <q>You want money to be false to me with your creature,
so here's the money for you. I give it to you myself. Take it, if
you have so little honor as to take it!</q> I wanted to prove what he
was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it
with that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I
knew all about it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him
that money to test him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of
honor as to take it from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked
into mine, and he understood it all and he took it&mdash;he carried off
my money!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true, Katya,</q> Mitya roared suddenly, <q>I looked into your
eyes and I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your
money. Despise me as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I've deserved
it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Prisoner,</q> cried the President, <q>another word and I will order
you to be removed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That money was a torment to him,</q> Katya went on with impulsive
haste. <q>He wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that's
true; but he needed money for that creature, too. So he murdered
his father, but he didn't repay me, and went off with her to that
village where he was arrested. There, again, he squandered the
money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a day
<pb n='781'/><anchor id='Pg781'/>
before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he
wrote it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite,
and feeling certain, positively certain, that I should never show it
to any one, even if he did kill him, or else he wouldn't have written
it. For he knew I shouldn't want to revenge myself and ruin him!
But read it, read it attentively&mdash;more attentively, please&mdash;and you
will see that he had described it all in his letter, all beforehand, how
he would kill his father and where his money was kept. Look, please,
don't overlook that, there's one phrase there, <q>I shall kill him as
soon as Ivan has gone away.</q> So he thought it all out beforehand
how he would kill him,</q> Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court
with venomous and malignant triumph. Oh! it was clear she had
studied every line of that letter and detected every meaning underlining
it. <q>If he hadn't been drunk, he wouldn't have written to
me; but, look, everything is written there beforehand, just as he
committed the murder after. A complete program of it!</q> she exclaimed
frantically.
</p>

<p>
She was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no
doubt, she had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then,
perhaps, shaking with anger, she had pondered whether to show it
at the trial or not. Now she had taken the fatal plunge. I remember
that the letter was read aloud by the clerk, directly afterwards,
I believe. It made an overwhelming impression. They asked Mitya
whether he admitted having written the letter.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's mine, mine!</q> cried Mitya. <q>I shouldn't have written it, if
I hadn't been drunk!... We've hated each other for many things,
Katya, but I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you,
and you didn't love me!</q>
</p>

<p>
He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The
prosecutor and counsel for the defense began cross-examining her,
chiefly to ascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document
and to give her evidence in quite a different tone and spirit
just before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my
honor and my conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has
hated and despised me so!</q> Katya cried madly. <q>Oh, he has despised
me horribly, he has always despised me, and do you know,
he has despised me from the very moment that I bowed down to
<pb n='782'/><anchor id='Pg782'/>
him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once at the time,
but for a long time I wouldn't believe it. How often I have read it
in his eyes, <q>You came of yourself, though.</q> Oh, he didn't understand,
he had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but
baseness, he judged me by himself, he thought every one was like
himself!</q> Katya hissed furiously, in a perfect frenzy. <q>And he only
wanted to marry me, because I'd inherited a fortune, because of
that, because of that! I always suspected it was because of that!
Oh, he is a brute! He was always convinced that I should be
trembling with shame all my life before him, because I went to him
then, and that he had a right to despise me for ever for it, and so
to be superior to me&mdash;that's why he wanted to marry me! That's
so, that's all so! I tried to conquer him by my love&mdash;a love that
knew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he
understood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed?
He is a monster! I only received that letter the next evening: it
was brought me from the tavern&mdash;and only that morning, only
that morning I wanted to forgive him everything, everything&mdash;even
his treachery!</q>
</p>

<p>
The President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her.
I can't help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage
of her hysteria and of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing
them say to her, <q>We understand how hard it is for you; be
sure we are able to feel for you,</q> and so on, and so on. And yet
they dragged the evidence out of the raving, hysterical woman. She
described at last with extraordinary clearness, which is so often
seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought states, how
Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last two
months trying to save <q>the monster and murderer,</q> his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>He tortured himself,</q> she exclaimed, <q>he was always trying to
minimize his brother's guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had
never loved his father, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh,
he has a tender, over-tender conscience! He tormented himself
with his conscience! He told me everything, everything! He came
every day and talked to me as his only friend. I have the honor to
be his only friend!</q> she cried suddenly with a sort of defiance, and
her eyes flashed. <q>He had been twice to see Smerdyakov. One day
he came to me and said, <q>If it was not my brother, but Smerdyakov
<pb n='783'/><anchor id='Pg783'/>
committed the murder</q> (for the legend was circulating everywhere
that Smerdyakov had done it), <q>perhaps I too am guilty, for Smerdyakov
knew I didn't like my father and perhaps believed that I
desired my father's death.</q> Then I brought out that letter and
showed it him. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done
it, and he was overwhelmed by it. He couldn't endure the thought
that his own brother was a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that
it was making him ill. During the last few days he has talked incoherently
in my presence. I saw his mind was giving way. He
walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the streets. The
doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the day before
yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever&mdash;and
all on his account, on account of this monster! And last night he
learnt that Smerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove
him out of his mind ... and all through this monster, all for the
sake of saving the monster!</q>
</p>

<p>
Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible
once in a lifetime&mdash;at the hour of death, for instance, on the way
to the scaffold! But it was in Katya's character, and it was such
a moment in her life. It was the same impetuous Katya who had
thrown herself on the mercy of a young profligate to save her father;
the same Katya who had just before, in her pride and chastity,
sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty before all these people,
telling of Mitya's generous conduct, in the hope of softening his
fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself; but this time
it was for another, and perhaps only now&mdash;perhaps only at this
moment&mdash;she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She
had sacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden
that he had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who
had committed the murder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself
to save him, to save his good name, his reputation!
</p>

<p>
And yet one terrible doubt occurred to one&mdash;was she lying in
her description of her former relations with Mitya?&mdash;that was the
question. No, she had not intentionally slandered him when she
cried that Mitya despised her for her bowing down to him! She
believed it herself. She had been firmly convinced, perhaps ever
since that bow, that the simple-hearted Mitya, who even then adored
her, was laughing at her and despising her. She had loved him with
<pb n='784'/><anchor id='Pg784'/>
an hysterical, <q>lacerated</q> love only from pride, from wounded
pride, and that love was not like love, but more like revenge. Oh!
perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love, perhaps
Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya's faithlessness
had wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart
could not forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her
suddenly, and all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully
in the offended woman's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly.
She betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed herself, too. And
no sooner had she given full expression to her feelings than the
tension of course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame.
Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor, sobbing and screaming.
She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with a wail,
rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya,</q> she wailed, <q>your serpent has destroyed you! There,
she has shown you what she is!</q> she shouted to the judges, shaking
with anger. At a signal from the President they seized her and tried
to remove her from the court. She wouldn't allow it. She fought
and struggled to get back to Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and
struggled to get to her. He was overpowered.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have
been satisfied&mdash;the show had been a varied one. Then I remember
the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President
had previously sent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for
Ivan. The doctor announced to the court that the sick man was
suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever, and that he must
be at once removed. In answer to questions from the prosecutor
and the counsel for the defense he said that the patient had come
to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and that he had
warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had not
consented to be looked after. <q>He was certainly not in a normal
state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was
awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead,
and that Satan visited him every evening,</q> said the doctor, in conclusion.
Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew.
The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the
material proofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to
proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of
<pb n='785'/><anchor id='Pg785'/>
evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.
</p>

<p>
But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only
repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with
their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together
in the prosecutor's speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every
one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe,
and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense
with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken
by Katerina Ivanovna's evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant.
When all the evidence had been taken, the court was
adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o'clock
when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit
Kirillovitch, began his speech.
</p>

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VI. The Prosecutor's Speech. Sketches Of Character</head>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with
nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and
cold all over by turns. He described this himself afterwards. He
regarded this speech as his <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chef-d'œuvre</foreign>,
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chef-d'œuvre</foreign> of his
whole life, as his swan-song. He died, it is true, nine months later
of rapid consumption, so that he had the right, as it turned out,
to compare himself to a swan singing his last song. He had put his
whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech. And poor
Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some feeling
for the public welfare and <q>the eternal question</q> lay concealed in
him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity. He
genuinely believed in the prisoner's guilt; he was accusing him not
as an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered
with a genuine passion <q>for the security of society.</q> Even the
ladies in the audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch,
admitted that he made an extraordinary impression on them.
He began in a breaking voice, but it soon gained strength and filled
the court to the end of his speech. But as soon as he had finished,
he almost fainted.
</p>

<pb n='786'/><anchor id='Pg786'/>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> began the prosecutor, <q rend='pre'>this case has
made a stir throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at,
what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed
to such crimes! That's what's so horrible, that such dark
deeds have ceased to horrify us. What ought to horrify us is that
we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated crime.
What are the causes of our indifference, our lukewarm attitude to
such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an unenviable
future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of intellect
and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in spite
of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their
foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles
among us? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are
disturbing, and every citizen not only must, but ought to be
harassed by them. Our newborn and still timid press has done
good service to the public already, for without it we should never
have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral degradation
which are continually made known by the press, not merely to
those who attend the new jury courts established in the present
reign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of
things beside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost
commonplace. But what is most important is that the majority of
our national crimes of violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now
so general among us that it is difficult to contend against it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the
very outset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a
pang of conscience, murdering an official who had once been his
benefactor, and the servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what
ready money he could find on him; <q>it will come in handy for my
pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future.</q>
After murdering them, he puts pillows under the head of each of
his victims; he goes away. Next, a young hero <q>decorated for
bravery</q> kills the mother of his chief and benefactor, like a highwayman,
and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that <q>she
loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take
no precautions.</q> Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in
these days that he is unique. Another man will not commit the
murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in
<pb n='787'/><anchor id='Pg787'/>
soul. In silence, alone with his conscience, he asks himself perhaps,
<q>What is honor, and isn't the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical,
that it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let
them say so&mdash;and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were
so! Oh, don't believe me, think of me as morbid, but remember my
words; if only a tenth, if only a twentieth part of what I say is true&mdash;even
so it's awful! Look how our young people commit suicide,
without asking themselves Hamlet's question what there is beyond,
without a sign of such a question, as though all that relates to the
soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long been erased
in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice, at
our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present
case, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of
them. And yet we all knew him, <q>he lived among us!</q>...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of
Europe will study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject
is worth it. But this study will come later, at leisure, when all the
tragic topsy-turvydom of to-day is farther behind us, so that it's
possible to examine it with more insight and more impartiality than
I can do. Now we are either horrified or pretend to be horrified,
though we really gloat over the spectacle, and love strong and eccentric
sensations which tickle our cynical, pampered idleness. Or,
like little children, we brush the dreadful ghosts away and hide
our heads in the pillow so as to return to our sports and merriment
as soon as they have vanished. But we must one day begin life in
sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society; it's time we
tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least to make
a beginning in that direction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A great writer<note place='foot'>Gogol is meant.</note> of the last epoch, comparing
Russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, <q>Oh, troika, birdlike
troika, who invented thee!</q> and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the
peoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the
recklessly galloping troika to pass. That may be, they may stand
aside, respectfully or no, but in my poor opinion the great writer
ended his book in this way either in an access of childish and naïve
<pb n='788'/><anchor id='Pg788'/>
optimism, or simply in fear of the censorship of the day. For if the
troika were drawn by his heroes, Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov,
it could reach no rational goal, whoever might be driving it.
And those were the heroes of an older generation, ours are worse
specimens still....</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch's speech was interrupted by applause.
The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The
applause was, it's true, of brief duration, so that the President did
not think it necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely
in the direction of the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged;
he had never been applauded before! He had been all
his life unable to get a hearing, and now he suddenly had an opportunity
of securing the ear of all Russia.
</p>

<p>
<q>What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such
an unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?</q> he continued. <q rend='pre'>Perhaps
I am exaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental
features of the educated class of to-day are reflected in this
family picture&mdash;only, of course, in miniature, <q>like the sun in a
drop of water.</q> Think of that unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man,
who has met with such a melancholy end, the head of a family!
Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor dependent position,
through an unexpected marriage he came into a small fortune. A
petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though undeveloped,
intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grew
bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristics
disappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that
remained. On the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his
vitality was excessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure,
and he brought his children up to be the same. He had no feelings
for his duties as a father. He ridiculed those duties. He left his
little children to the servants, and was glad to be rid of them, forgot
about them completely. The old man's maxim was <foreign lang='fr'
rend='italic'>Après moi le déluge</foreign>. He was an
example of everything that is opposed to civic
duty, of the most complete and malignant individualism. <q>The
world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all right,</q> and he
was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on living in the
same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own
son and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get
<pb n='789'/><anchor id='Pg789'/>
his mistress from him. No, I don't intend to leave the prisoner's
defense altogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I
will speak the truth myself, I can well understand what resentment
he had heaped up in his son's heart against him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the
penalty. Let us remember, however, that he was a father, and one
of the typical fathers of to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that
he is typical of many modern fathers? Alas! many of them only
differ in not openly professing such cynicism, for they are better
educated, more cultured, but their philosophy is essentially the same
as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, but you have agreed to forgive
me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not believe me, but let me
speak. Let me say what I have to say, and remember something of
my words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One
of them is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal
with him. Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education
and vigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He
has denied and rejected much already, like his father. We have all
heard him, he was a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed
his opinions, quite the contrary in fact, which justifies me
in speaking rather openly of him now, of course, not as an individual,
but as a member of the Karamazov family. Another personage
closely connected with the case died here by his own hand last night.
I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and possibly the illegitimate
son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the preliminary
inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young
Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. <q>Everything
in the world is lawful according to him, and nothing must be
forbidden in the future&mdash;that is what he always taught me.</q> I
believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory, though,
of course, the epileptic attacks from which he suffered, and this
terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his faculties. But he
dropped one very interesting observation, which would have done
credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed, why I've
mentioned it: <q>If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor Pavlovitch
in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n='790'/><anchor id='Pg790'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling
it indelicate to continue further. Oh, I don't want to draw any
further conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man's
future. We've seen to-day in this court that there are still good
impulses in his young heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed
in him by lack of faith and cynicism, which have come to
him rather by inheritance than by the exercise of independent
thought.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who
does not share his elder brother's gloomy and destructive theory of
life. He has sought to cling to the <q>ideas of the people,</q> or to what
goes by that name in some circles of our intellectual classes. He
clung to the monastery, and was within an ace of becoming a monk.
He seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously, and so early, that
timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society, who dread
cynicism and its corrupting influences, and mistakenly attribute all
the mischief to European enlightenment, to return to their <q>native
soil,</q> as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth,
like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered
bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only
to escape the horrors that terrify them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every
success; I trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the
ideas of the people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the
moral side into gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind
chauvinism&mdash;two elements which are even a greater menace to
Russia than the premature decay, due to misunderstanding and
gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his elder brother
is suffering.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of
chauvinism and mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed,
carried away by his own eloquence. All this had little to do with
the case in hand, to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat
vague, but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the
desire to express himself once in his life. People said afterwards that
he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism of Ivan, because
the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of him
in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to
<pb n='791'/><anchor id='Pg791'/>
take his revenge. But I don't know whether it was true. All this
was only introductory, however, and the speech passed to more
direct consideration of the case.
</p>

<p>
<q>But to return to the eldest son,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch went on.
<q rend='pre'>He is the prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too,
before us; the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the
surface. While his brothers seem to stand for <q>Europeanism</q> and
<q>the principles of the people,</q> he seems to represent Russia as she is.
Oh, not all Russia, not all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here
we have her, our mother Russia, the very scent and sound of her.
Oh, he is spontaneous, he is a marvelous mingling of good and evil,
he is a lover of culture and Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and
plucks out the beards of his boon companions. Oh, he, too, can be
good and noble, but only when all goes well with him. What is
more, he can be carried off his feet, positively carried off his feet
by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves, if they fall
from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. He dislikes
paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that's so
with him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life
(he couldn't be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way,
and he will show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no,
but he must have money, a great deal of money, and you will see
how generously, with what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all
away in the reckless dissipation of one night. But if he has not
money, he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in
great need of it. But all this later, let us take events in their
chronological order.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about
the back-yard <q>without boots on his feet,</q> as our worthy and esteemed
fellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now.
I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am
here to accuse him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human;
I, too, can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character.
But the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and
other reckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier
towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an officer. And, of
course, he needed money, money before all things, and so after prolonged
disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the last
<pb n='792'/><anchor id='Pg792'/>
six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he
practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with
his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and
brilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you
have only just heard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there,
and I will be silent. The figure of the young officer, frivolous and
profligate, doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown
in a very sympathetic light before us. But the other side of the
medal was unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very
court. Again I will not venture to conjecture why it happened so,
but there were causes. The same lady, bathed in tears of long-concealed
indignation, alleged that he, he of all men, had despised her
for her action, which, though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still
dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, the girl's betrothed,
looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable
from him than from any one. And knowing that he had
already deceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was
bound to endure everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally
offered him three thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly,
let him understand that she was offering him money to deceive her.
<q>Well, will you take it or not, are you so lost to shame?</q> was the
dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He looked at her, saw
clearly what was in her mind (he's admitted here before you that
he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand unconditionally,
and squandered it in two days with the new object of his
affections.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young
officer sacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity
and doing reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a
rule, between two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the
present case this is not true. The probability is that in the first
case he was genuinely noble, and in the second as genuinely base.
And why? Because he was of the broad Karamazov character&mdash;that's
just what I am leading up to&mdash;capable of combining the most
incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest heights and
of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made by
a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close
<pb n='793'/><anchor id='Pg793'/>
quarters&mdash;Mr. Rakitin: <q>The sense of their own degradation is as
essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their
lofty generosity.</q> And that's true, they need continually this unnatural
mixture. Two extremes at the same moment, or they are
miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete. They are
wide, wide as mother Russia; they include everything and put up
with everything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we've just touched upon
that three thousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things
a little. Can you conceive that a man like that, on receiving that
sum and in such a way, at the price of such shame, such disgrace,
such utter degradation, could have been capable that very day of
setting apart half that sum, that very day, and sewing it up in a
little bag, and would have had the firmness of character to carry it
about with him for a whole month afterwards, in spite of every
temptation and his extreme need of it! Neither in drunken debauchery
in taverns, nor when he was flying into the country, trying
to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him to
remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his
father, did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only
to avoid abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so
jealous, he would have been certain to have opened that bag and to
have stayed at home to keep watch over her, and to await the moment
when she would say to him at last <q>I am yours,</q> and to fly with
her far from their fatal surroundings.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason
he gives for it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when
she would say, <q>I am yours, take me where you will,</q> he might have
the wherewithal to take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner's
own words, was of little weight beside the second. While I have
that money on me, he said, I am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can
always go to my insulted betrothed, and, laying down half the sum
I have fraudulently appropriated, I can always say to her, <q>You see,
I've squandered half your money, and shown I am a weak and immoral
man, and, if you like, a scoundrel</q> (I use the prisoner's own
expressions), <q>but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a thief, for if
I had been a thief, I shouldn't have brought you back this half of
the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!</q> A
<pb n='794'/><anchor id='Pg794'/>
marvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not
resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at
the price of such disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most
stoical firmness, and carries about a thousand roubles without daring
to touch it. Does that fit in at all with the character we have
analyzed? No, and I venture to tell you how the real Dmitri
Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances, if he really
had brought himself to put away the money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At the first temptation&mdash;for instance, to entertain the woman
with whom he had already squandered half the money&mdash;he would
have unpicked his little bag and have taken out some hundred
roubles, for why should he have taken back precisely half the money,
that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why not fourteen hundred? He
could just as well have said then that he was not a thief, because he
brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time he
would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and
then a third, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he
would have taken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back
only a hundred it would answer the purpose, for a thief would have
stolen it all. And then he would have looked at this last note, and
have said to himself, <q>It's really not worth while to give back one
hundred; let's spend that, too!</q> That's how the real Dmitri Karamazov,
as we know him, would have behaved. One cannot imagine
anything more incongruous with the actual fact than this legend
of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable. But we
shall return to that later.</q>
</p>

<p>
After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning
the financial relations of father and son, and arguing again
and again that it was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to
determine which was in the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to
the evidence of the medical experts in reference to Mitya's fixed idea
about the three thousand owing him.
</p>

</div>

<pb n='795'/><anchor id='Pg795'/>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. An Historical Survey</head>

<p>
<q>The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner
is out of his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain
that he is in his right mind, and that if he had not been, he would
have behaved more cleverly. As for his being a maniac, that I
would agree with, but only in one point, that is, his fixed idea about
the three thousand. Yet I think one might find a much simpler
cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part I agree thoroughly
with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner's mental
faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been irritable
and exasperated. The object of the prisoner's continual and violent
anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the
bottom of it. That motive is jealousy!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner's fatal
passion for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner
went to the <q>young person's</q> lodgings <q>to beat her</q>&mdash;<q>I use
his own expression,</q> the prosecutor explained&mdash;<q rend='pre'>but instead of
beating her, he remained there, at her feet. That was the beginning of
the passion. At the same time the prisoner's father was captivated
by the same young person&mdash;a strange and fatal coincidence, for they
both lost their hearts to her simultaneously, though both had known
her before. And she inspired in both of them the most violent,
characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her own confession:
<q>I was laughing at both of them.</q> Yes, the sudden desire to make a
jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once.
The old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand
roubles as a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he
would have been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet,
if only she would become his lawful wife. We have good evidence
of this. As for the prisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it
is before us. But such was the young person's <q>game.</q> The enchantress
gave the unhappy young man no hope until the last moment,
when he knelt before her, stretching out hands that were
already stained with the blood of his father and rival. It was in
<pb n='796'/><anchor id='Pg796'/>
that position that he was arrested. <q>Send me to Siberia with him, I
have brought him to this, I am most to blame,</q> the woman herself
cried, in genuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr.
Rakitin, characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms:
<q>She was disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed,
who seduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty,
cursed by her respectable family, and taken under the protection of
a wealthy old man, whom she still, however, considers as her benefactor.
There was perhaps much that was good in her young heart,
but it was embittered too early. She became prudent and saved
money. She grew sarcastic and resentful against society.</q> After this
sketch of her character it may well be understood that she might
laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from malice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during
which he betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted
to his honor, the prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to
madness by continual jealousy&mdash;and of whom? His father! And
the worst of it was that the crazy old man was alluring and enticing
the object of his affection by means of that very three thousand
roubles, which the son looked upon as his own property, part of his
inheritance from his mother, of which his father was cheating him.
Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man to
madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was
used with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering
his father had entered the prisoner's head, and illustrated his
theory with facts.
</p>

<p>
<q>At first he only talked about it in taverns&mdash;he was talking about
it all that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company,
and he likes to tell his companions everything, even his most
diabolical and dangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with
others, and expects, for some reason, that those he confides in will
meet him with perfect sympathy, enter into all his troubles and
anxieties, take his part and not oppose him in anything. If not, he
flies into a rage and smashes up everything in the tavern. [Then followed
the anecdote about Captain Snegiryov.] Those who heard
<pb n='797'/><anchor id='Pg797'/>
the prisoner began to think at last that he might mean more than
threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats into actions.</q>
</p>

<p>
Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the
monastery, the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene
of violence when the prisoner had rushed into his father's house just
after dinner.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot positively assert,</q> the prosecutor continued, <q>that the
prisoner fully intended to murder his father before that incident.
Yet the idea had several times presented itself to him, and he had
deliberated on it&mdash;for that we have facts, witnesses, and his own
words. I confess, gentlemen of the jury,</q> he added, <q rend='pre'>that till to-day
I have been uncertain whether to attribute to the prisoner conscious
premeditation. I was firmly convinced that he had pictured the
fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating
it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered when and how
he might commit the crime.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was
presented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young
lady's exclamation, <q>It is the plan, the program of the murder!</q>
That is how she defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy
prisoner. And, in fact, from that letter we see that the whole
fact of the murder was premeditated. It was written two days
before, and so we know now for a fact that, forty-eight hours
before the perpetration of his terrible design, the prisoner swore
that, if he could not get money next day, he would murder his
father in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his
pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. <q>As soon as Ivan had gone away</q>&mdash;you
hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every
circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it.
The proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been
committed for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is
written and signed. The prisoner does not deny his signature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does
not diminish the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote
when drunk what he had planned when sober. Had he not planned
it when sober, he would not have written it when drunk. I shall
be asked: Then why did he talk about it in taverns? A man who
<pb n='798'/><anchor id='Pg798'/>
premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself. Yes, but
he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when he had only
the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less about
it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the <q>Metropolis</q> tavern,
contrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking.
He did not play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He
did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost
unconsciously, because he could never enter a tavern without making
a disturbance. It is true that after he had taken the final decision,
he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked too much
about his design beforehand, and that this might lead to his arrest
and prosecution afterwards. But there was nothing for it; he could
not take his words back, but his luck had served him before, it
would serve him again. He believed in his star, you know! I must
confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe.
<q>To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,</q> as he
writes in his peculiar language, <q>and if they won't give it to me,
there will be bloodshed.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all
Mitya's efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to
Samsonov, his journey to Lyagavy. <q>Harassed, jeered at, hungry,
after selling his watch to pay for the journey (though he tells us he
had fifteen hundred roubles on him&mdash;a likely story), tortured by
jealousy at having left the object of his affections in the town, suspecting
that she would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his absence, he
returned at last to the town, to find, to his joy, that she had not
been near his father. He accompanied her himself to her protector.
(Strange to say, he doesn't seem to have been jealous of Samsonov,
which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to his
ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in
a fit, that the other servant is ill&mdash;the coast is clear and he knows
the <q>signals</q>&mdash;what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a
lady who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is
highly esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who
had long watched his career with compassion, gave him the most
judicious advice, to give up his dissipated life, his unseemly love-affair,
the waste of his youth and vigor in pot-house debauchery, and
to set off to Siberia to the gold-mines: <q>that would be an outlet for
<pb n='799'/><anchor id='Pg799'/>
your turbulent energies, your romantic character, your thirst for
adventure.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
After describing the result of this conversation and the moment
when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov's,
the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy
and nervous exhaustion, at the thought that she had deceived
him and was now with his father, Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by
dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance. <q rend='pre'>Had the maid told
him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her former lover, nothing
would have happened. But she lost her head, she could only swear
and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did not kill her on the
spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false mistress.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle.
Why that? Why not some other weapon? But since he had been
contemplating his plan and preparing himself for it for a whole
month, he would snatch up anything like a weapon that caught his
eye. He had realized for a month past that any object of the kind
would serve as a weapon, so he instantly, without hesitation, recognized
that it would serve his purpose. So it was by no means unconsciously,
by no means involuntarily, that he snatched up that fatal
pestle. And then we find him in his father's garden&mdash;the coast is
clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The suspicion
that she was there, with him, with his rival, in his arms, and perhaps
laughing at him at that moment&mdash;took his breath away. And it
was not mere suspicion, the deception was open, obvious. She must
be there, in that lighted room, she must be behind the screen; and
the unhappy man would have us believe that he stole up to the
window, peeped respectfully in, and discreetly withdrew, for fear
something terrible and immoral should happen. And he tries to
persuade us of that, us, who understand his character, who know his
state of mind at the moment, and that he knew the signals by which
he could at once enter the house.</q> At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch
broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of Smerdyakov
with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and
every one realized that, although he professed to despise that suspicion,
he thought the subject of great importance.

<head>Chapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
<q>To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?</q> (Ippolit
Kirillovitch began.) <q>The first person who cried out that
Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at
the moment of his arrest, yet from that time to this he had not
brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest
suggestion of a fact. The charge is confirmed by three persons
only&mdash;the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The
elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to-day, when he
was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for
the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his
brother's guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of
that later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the
slightest fact to support his notion of Smerdyakov's guilt, and has
only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner's own words and
the expression of his face. Yes, that astounding piece of evidence
has been brought forward twice to-day by him. Madame Svyetlov
was even more astounding. <q>What the prisoner tells you, you must
believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.</q> That is all the evidence against
Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are all deeply
concerned in the prisoner's fate. And yet the theory of Smerdyakov's
guilt has been noised about, has been and is still maintained.
Is it credible? Is it conceivable?</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the
personality of Smerdyakov, <q>who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.</q>
He depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering
of education, who had been thrown off his balance by philosophical
ideas above his level and certain modern theories of duty,
which he learnt in practice from the reckless life of his master, who
was also perhaps his father&mdash;Fyodor Pavlovitch; and, theoretically,
from various strange philosophical conversations with his master's
elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily indulged in this diversion,
probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse himself at the valet's
expense. <q>He spoke to me himself of his spiritual condition during
<pb n='801'/><anchor id='Pg801'/>
the last few days at his father's house,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch explained;
<q rend='pre'>but others too have borne witness to it&mdash;the prisoner himself,
his brother, and the servant Grigory&mdash;that is, all who knew
him well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks
of epilepsy, had not the courage of a chicken. <q>He fell at my feet
and kissed them,</q> the prisoner himself has told us, before he realized
how damaging such a statement was to himself. <q>He is an epileptic
chicken,</q> he declared about him in his characteristic language. And
the prisoner chose him for his confidant (we have his own word for
it) and he frightened him into consenting at last to act as a spy
for him. In that capacity he deceived his master, revealing to the
prisoner the existence of the envelope with the notes in it and the
signals by means of which he could get into the house. How could
he help telling him, indeed? <q>He would have killed me, I could
see that he would have killed me,</q> he said at the inquiry, trembling
and shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time
arrested and could do him no harm. <q>He suspected me at every
instant. In fear and trembling I hastened to tell him every secret
to pacify him, that he might see that I had not deceived him and
let me off alive.</q> Those are his own words. I wrote them down and
I remember them. <q>When he began shouting at me, I would fall on
my knees.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence
of his master, ever since he had restored him some money he
had lost. So it may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs
of remorse at having deceived his master, whom he loved as his
benefactor. Persons severely afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most
skillful doctors tell us, always prone to continual and morbid self-reproach.
They worry over their <q>wickedness,</q> they are tormented
by pangs of conscience, often entirely without cause; they exaggerate
and often invent all sorts of faults and crimes. And here
we have a man of that type who had really been driven to wrong-doing
by terror and intimidation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible
would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before
his eyes. When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just
before the catastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though
<pb n='802'/><anchor id='Pg802'/>
he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared. He confined
himself to hints, but his hints were not understood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a
protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm
would come to pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov's
drunken letter, <q>I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.</q>
So Ivan Fyodorovitch's presence seemed to every one a guarantee of
peace and order in the house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But he went away, and within an hour of his young master's
departure Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that's
perfectly intelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed
by terror and despair of a sort, had felt during those last few
days that one of the fits from which he had suffered before at moments
of strain, might be coming upon him again. The day and
hour of such an attack cannot, of course, be foreseen, but every
epileptic can feel beforehand that he is likely to have one. So the
doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch had driven
out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his lonely and unprotected
position, went to the cellar. He went down the stairs wondering
if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to come
upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,
brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks,
and he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly
natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he
was shamming an attack <emph>on purpose</emph>. But, if it were on purpose,
the question arises at once, what was his motive? What was he
reckoning on? What was he aiming at? I say nothing about
medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the doctors were not
able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real. That
may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for
such a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder,
have desired to attract the attention of the household by having a
fit just before?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder,
there were five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch's&mdash;Fyodor Pavlovitch
himself (but he did not kill himself, that's evident); then his
servant, Grigory, but he was almost killed himself; the third person
was Grigory's wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, but it would be simply
<pb n='803'/><anchor id='Pg803'/>
shameful to imagine her murdering her master. Two persons are
left&mdash;the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are to believe the
prisoner's statement that he is not the murderer, then Smerdyakov
must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else can
be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation
against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday.
Had a shadow of suspicion rested on any one else, had there been
any sixth person, I am persuaded that even the prisoner would have
been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov, and would have accused that
sixth person, for to charge Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly
absurd.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine,
let us even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what
the facts tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it?
Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the
first alternative&mdash;that he did it alone. If he had killed him it must
have been with some object, for some advantage to himself. But not
having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder&mdash;hatred,
jealousy, and so on&mdash;Smerdyakov could only have murdered
him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the three
thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And
yet he tells another person&mdash;and a person most closely interested,
that is, the prisoner&mdash;everything about the money and the signals,
where the envelope lay, what was written on it, what it was tied
up with, and, above all, told him of those signals by which he could
enter the house. Did he do this simply to betray himself, or to
invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that
envelope for himself? <q>Yes,</q> I shall be told, <q>but he betrayed it
from fear.</q> But how do you explain this? A man who could conceive
such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells facts
which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held
his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a
crime, nothing would have induced him to tell any one about the
envelope and the signals, for that was as good as betraying himself
beforehand. He would have invented something, he would have
told some lie if he had been forced to give information, but he would
have been silent about that. For, on the other hand, if he had said
<pb n='804'/><anchor id='Pg804'/>
nothing about the money, but had committed the murder and stolen
the money, no one in the world could have charged him with murder
for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the money, no
one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had been
accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had
committed it from some other motive. But since no one had observed
any such motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on
the contrary, that his master was fond of him and honored him with
his confidence, he would, of course, have been the last to be suspected.
People would have suspected first the man who had a
motive, a man who had himself declared he had such motives, who
had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected the
son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov
killed and robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would,
of course, have suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that,
though plotting the murder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the
money, the envelope, and the signals? Is that logical? Is that
clear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we
have him falling downstairs in a <emph>feigned</emph> fit&mdash;with what object?
In the first place that Grigory, who had been intending to take his
medicine, might put it off and remain on guard, seeing there was no
one to look after the house, and, in the second place, I suppose, that
his master seeing that there was no one to guard him, and in terror
of a visit from his son, might redouble his vigilance and precaution.
And, most of all, I suppose that he, Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit,
might be carried from the kitchen, where he always slept, apart
from all the rest, and where he could go in and out as he liked, to
Grigory's room at the other end of the lodge, where he was always
put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This
was the immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted
Marfa Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying
behind the screen, he would most likely, to keep up the sham, have
begun groaning, and so keeping them awake all night (as Grigory
and his wife testified). And all this, we are to believe, that he might
more conveniently get up and murder his master!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he
might not be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money
<pb n='805'/><anchor id='Pg805'/>
and the signals to tempt him to commit the murder, and when he
had murdered him and had gone away with the money, making a
noise, most likely, and waking people, Smerdyakov got up, am I to
believe, and went in&mdash;what for? To murder his master a second
time and carry off the money that had already been stolen? Gentlemen,
are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions,
but, incredible as it seems, that's just what the prisoner alleges.
When he had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised
an alarm, he tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his
master and stole the money! I won't press the point that Smerdyakov
could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand, and have
foreseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to
peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, and beat a retreat,
leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put this
question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov
could have committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can't
accuse him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,
heard a shout, and went out. Well&mdash;what then? He
looked about him and said, <q>Why not go and kill the master?</q> And
how did he know what had happened, since he had been lying unconscious
till that moment? But there's a limit to these flights of
fancy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Quite so,</q> some astute people will tell me, <q>but what if they were
in agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared
the money&mdash;what then?</q> A weighty question, truly! And the facts
to confirm it are astounding. One commits the murder and takes
all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit,
apparently to arouse suspicion in every one, alarm in his master and
alarm in Grigory. It would be interesting to know what motives
could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane
plan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov's
part, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov
was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing
that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered,
without screaming for help or resisting, he may have obtained permission
from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming
<pb n='806'/><anchor id='Pg806'/>
a fit&mdash;<q>you may murder him as you like; it's nothing to me.</q> But
as this attack of Smerdyakov's was bound to throw the household
into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such
a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did
agree, it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer
and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and
not even an accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will
through terror.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly
throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of
being his accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. <q>He did
it alone,</q> he says. <q>He murdered and robbed him. It was the work
of his hands.</q> Strange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one
another at once! And think of the risk for Karamazov. After
committing the murder while his accomplice lay in bed, he throws
the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented it and in
self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he might
well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was
responsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were
punished, it would be far less severely than the real murderer. But
in that case he would have been certain to make a confession, yet
he has not done so. Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity,
though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him and declaring
that he had committed the crime alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>What's more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement
that it was <emph>he</emph> who had told the prisoner of the envelope of
notes and of the signals, and that, but for him, he would have known
nothing about them. If he had really been a guilty accomplice,
would he so readily have made this statement at the inquiry? On
the contrary, he would have tried to conceal it, to distort the facts
or minimize them. But he was far from distorting or minimizing
them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being
charged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit
of melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged
himself yesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language,
<q>I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no
blame on any one.</q> What would it have cost him to add: <q>I am
<pb n='807'/><anchor id='Pg807'/>
the murderer, not Karamazov</q>? But that he did not add. Did his
conscience lead him to suicide and not to avowing his guilt?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were
brought into the court just now, and we were told that they were
the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us, and
that the witness had received them from Smerdyakov the day before.
But I need not recall the painful scene, though I will make
one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones as might not be
obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be overlooked. In
the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money and
hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he
confessed his guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us.
If it were not so, indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept
silence till now? And so, if he has confessed, then why, I ask
again, did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left
behind, knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible
ordeal the next day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the
fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this
court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons
of five thousand each&mdash;that is, ten thousand in all&mdash;to the chief
town of the province to be changed. I only mention this to point
out that any one may have money, and that it can't be proved that
these notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch's envelope.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication
of such importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why
didn't he report it at once? Why did he put it all off till morning?
I think I have a right to conjecture why. His health had been
giving way for a week past: he had admitted to a doctor and to his
most intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and
seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on the eve of the attack of
brain fever by which he has been stricken down to-day. In this
condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov's death, and at once
reflected, <q>The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save
my brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that
Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.</q> You will say that
was dishonorable: it's dishonorable to slander even the dead, and
even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered him unconsciously?
<pb n='808'/><anchor id='Pg808'/>
What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the
valet's death, he imagined it really was so? You saw the recent
scene: you have seen the witness's condition. He was standing up
and was speaking, but where was his mind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then followed the document, the prisoner's letter written two
days before the crime, and containing a complete program of the
murder. Why, then, are we looking for any other program? The
crime was committed precisely according to this program, and by
no other than the writer of it. Yes, gentlemen of the jury, it went
off without a hitch! He did not run respectfully and timidly away
from his father's window, though he was firmly convinced that the
object of his affections was with him. No, that is absurd and unlikely!
He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed him
in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated
rival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass
pestle, and having convinced himself, after careful search, that she
was not there, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the
pillow and take out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now
on the table before us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very
characteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer
and had he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would
he have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside
the corpse? Had it been Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his
master to rob him, he would have simply carried away the envelope
with him, without troubling himself to open it over his victim's
corpse, for he would have known for certain that the notes were in
the envelope&mdash;they had been put in and sealed up in his presence&mdash;and
had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have
known of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov
have behaved in that way? Would he have left the envelope on
the floor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who
was not a thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched
the notes from under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but
as though seizing his own property from the thief who had stolen it.
For that was the idea which had become almost an insane obsession
in Dmitri Karamazov in regard to that money. And pouncing
<pb n='809'/><anchor id='Pg809'/>
upon the envelope, which he had never seen before, he tore it open
to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran away with the
money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had left
an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope
on the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he
didn't think, he didn't reflect, and how should he? He ran away;
he heard behind him the servant cry out; the old man caught him,
stopped him and was felled to the ground by the brass pestle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would
you believe it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion,
to see whether he could do anything for him. Was that a
moment to show compassion? No; he jumped down simply to
make certain whether the only witness of his crime were dead or
alive. Any other feeling, any other motive would be unnatural.
Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wiped his head with his
handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran to the
house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it
he never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at
once detected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not
even notice that he was covered with blood. That may be believed,
that is very possible, that always happens at such moments with
criminals. On one point they will show diabolical cunning, while
another will escape them altogether. But he was thinking at that
moment of one thing only&mdash;where was <emph>she</emph>? He wanted to find out
at once where she was, so he ran to her lodging and learnt an unexpected
and astounding piece of news&mdash;she had gone off to Mokroe
to meet her first lover.</q>

<head>Chapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor's Speech.</head>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of
exposition, beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation
a check on their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his
<pb n='810'/><anchor id='Pg810'/>
speech he went off into a dissertation on Grushenka's <q>first lover,</q>
and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed,
so to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first
lover. What makes it all the more strange is that he seems to have
hardly thought of this formidable rival. But he had looked upon
him as a remote danger, and Karamazov always lives in the present.
Possibly he regarded him as a fiction. But his wounded heart grasped
instantly that the woman had been concealing this new rival and
deceiving him, because he was anything but a fiction to her, because
he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this instantly, he
resigned himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected
trait in the prisoner's character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible
desire for justice, a respect for woman and a recognition
of her right to love. And all this at the very moment when he had
stained his hands with his father's blood for her sake! It is true
that the blood he had shed was already crying out for vengeance,
for, after having ruined his soul and his life in this world, he was
forced to ask himself at that same instant what he was and what
he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him than his own
soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned penitent,
with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with
honorable offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life.
And he, luckless man, what could he give her now, what could he
offer her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him
by his crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a
man with life before him! This thought crushed him. And so he
instantly flew to one frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's
character, must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his
terrible position. That way out was suicide. He ran for the pistols
he had left in pledge with his friend Perhotin and on the way, as
he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money, for the sake of which
he had stained his hands with his father's gore. Oh, now he needed
money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would
shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a
poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. <q>To her, to
<pb n='811'/><anchor id='Pg811'/>
her! and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such
as never was before, that will be remembered and talked of long
after! In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy
songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I
adore and her new-found happiness! And then, on the spot, at her
feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She
will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya
loved her, she will feel for Mitya!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and
sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes,
but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that
cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the
heart unto death&mdash;that <emph>something</emph> is conscience, gentlemen of the
jury, its judgment, its terrible torments! The pistol will settle
everything, the pistol is the only way out! But <emph>beyond</emph>&mdash;I don't
know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment <q>What lies
beyond,</q> and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder <q>What
lies beyond.</q> No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets,
but we still have our Karamazovs!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's preparations,
the scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the drivers. He
quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and
the picture made a terrible impression on the audience. The guilt
of this harassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing,
when the facts were brought together.
</p>

<p>
<q>What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost
confessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out.</q> (Then followed the
evidence given by witnesses.) <q rend='pre'>He even cried out to the peasant
who drove him, <q>Do you know, you are driving a murderer!</q> But
it was impossible for him to speak out, he had to get to Mokroe and
there to finish his romance. But what was awaiting the luckless
man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw that his invincible
rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the toast
to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be
acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from
the preliminary inquiry. Karamazov's triumph over his rival was
complete and his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most
terrible phase through which his soul has passed or will pass.</q>
</p>

<pb n='812'/><anchor id='Pg812'/>

<p>
<q>One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,</q> the prosecutor
continued, <q rend='pre'>that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring
their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice.
What's more, justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate
the punishment of nature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of
the criminal at such moments, as its salvation from despair. For I
cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when
he learnt that she loved him, that for his sake she had rejected her
first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya, to a new life, that
she was promising him happiness&mdash;and when? When everything
was over for him and nothing was possible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for
the light it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment. This
woman, this love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very
instant of his arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by
him but unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why
did he relinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was?
It was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying
it that restrained him. Throughout their revels he kept close to
his adored mistress, who was at the banquet with him and was more
charming and fascinating to him than ever&mdash;he did not leave her
side, abasing himself in his homage before her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear
of arrest, but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh,
only for a moment! I can picture the state of mind of the criminal
hopelessly enslaved by these influences&mdash;first, the influence of drink,
of noise and excitement, of the thud of the dance and the scream
of the song, and of her, flushed with wine, singing and dancing and
laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in the background that the
fatal end might still be far off, that not till next morning, at least,
they would come and take him. So he had a few hours and that's
much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many things.
I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when they
are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street
to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then
there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of
that street the dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning
of the journey the condemned man, sitting on his shameful
<pb n='813'/><anchor id='Pg813'/>
cart, must feel that he has infinite life still before him. The houses
recede, the cart moves on&mdash;oh, that's nothing, it's still far to the
turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and
to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes
fixed on him, and he still fancies that he is just such a man as they.
But now the turning comes to the next street. Oh, that's nothing,
nothing, there's still a whole street before him, and however many
houses have been passed, he will still think there are many left.
And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. <q>They've
not had time yet,</q> he must have thought, <q>I may still find some way
out, oh, there's still time to make some plan of defense, and now,
now&mdash;she is so fascinating!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however,
to put aside half his money and hide it somewhere&mdash;I cannot
otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand
he had just taken from his father's pillow. He had been in
Mokroe more than once before, he had caroused there for two days
together already, he knew the old big house with all its passages and
outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money was hidden in that
house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice, under some floor,
in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I shall be
asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he
hadn't yet considered how to meet it, he hadn't the time, his head
was throbbing and his heart was with <emph>her</emph>, but money&mdash;money was
indispensable in any case! With money a man is always a man.
Perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as unnatural?
But he assures us himself that a month before, at a critical
and exciting moment, he had halved his money and sewn it up in a
little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall prove directly,
it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had
contemplated it. What's more, when he declared at the inquiry
that he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never
existed) he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of
the moment, because he had two hours before divided his money and
hidden half of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency, simply
not to have it on himself. Two extremes, gentlemen of the
<pb n='814'/><anchor id='Pg814'/>
jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate two extremes and
both at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money.
It may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be
in the prisoner's hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his
knees before her, she was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched
out to her and he had so entirely forgotten everything that he did
not even hear the men coming to arrest him. He hadn't time to
prepare any line of defense in his mind. He was caught unawares
and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his destiny.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of
our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his
account, too! The moments of contemplating that animal fear,
when the criminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still means
to struggle, the moments when every instinct of self-preservation
rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and
suffering eyes, studies you, your face, your thoughts, uncertain on
which side you will strike, and his distracted mind frames thousands
of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to speak, afraid of giving
himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for
self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the human soul, are
awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal
even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some
very compromising phrases. <q>Blood! I've deserved it!</q> But he
quickly restrained himself. He had not prepared what he was to
say, what answer he was to make, he had nothing but a bare denial
ready. <q>I am not guilty of my father's death.</q> That was his fence
for the moment and behind it he hoped to throw up a barricade of
some sort. His first compromising exclamations he hastened to
explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death of the
servant Grigory only. <q>Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has
killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have
killed him, <emph>if not I</emph>?</q> Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had
come to ask him that question! Do you hear that phrase uttered
with such premature haste&mdash;<q>if not I</q>&mdash;the animal cunning, the naïveté,
the Karamazov impatience of it? <q>I didn't kill him and you
mustn't think I did! I wanted to kill him, gentlemen, I wanted
<pb n='815'/><anchor id='Pg815'/>
to kill him,</q> he hastens to admit (he was in a hurry, in a terrible
hurry), <q>but still I am not guilty, it is not I murdered him.</q> He
concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though to say, you
can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you'll believe all the
sooner that I didn't murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is
often amazingly shallow and credulous.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally,
the most simple question, <q>Wasn't it Smerdyakov killed
him?</q> Then, as we expected, he was horribly angry at our having
anticipated him and caught him unawares, before he had time to
pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be
most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name. He rushed at once
to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to assure us that
Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of it. But
don't believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn't really give
up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him
forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but
he would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled
for him. He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a
few days later, choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, <q>You know
I was more skeptical about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that
yourselves, but now I am convinced. He killed him, he must have
done!</q> And for the present he falls back upon a gloomy and irritable
denial. Impatience and anger prompted him, however, to the
most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked into his
father's window and how he respectfully withdrew. The worst of
it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the evidence
given by Grigory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged
him, the whole three thousand had not been found on him,
only half of it. And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence,
the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him. No doubt he was
conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully
to make it sound more likely, to weave it into a romance that
would sound plausible. In such cases the first duty, the chief task
of the investigating lawyers, is to prevent the criminal being prepared,
to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out
his cherished ideas in all their simplicity, improbability and inconsistency.
<pb n='816'/><anchor id='Pg816'/>
The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and
apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of some circumstance
of great importance in the case, of which he had no previous
idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in
readiness&mdash;that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through
which the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about
that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have
seen it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us,
<q>Then Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!</q> and so
betrayed the basis of the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed
it in its most improbable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have
committed the murder after he had knocked Grigory down and run
away. When we told him that Grigory saw the door was open
before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as
he came out of his bedroom&mdash;Karamazov was positively crushed. My
esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards
that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And
to improve matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of
little bag&mdash;so be it, you shall hear this romance!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider
this romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention
that could have been brought forward in the circumstances. If
one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could
hardly find anything more incredible. The worst of such stories is
that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and
crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which
these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers neglect as insignificant
trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details, their
minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and
fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that's how
they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, <q>Where did
you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?</q> <q>I
made it myself.</q> <q>And where did you get the linen?</q> The prisoner
was positively offended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him
such a trivial question, and would you believe it, his resentment was
genuine! But they are all like that. <q>I tore it off my shirt.</q> <q>Then
we shall find that shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece
<pb n='817'/><anchor id='Pg817'/>
torn off.</q> And only fancy, gentlemen of the jury, if we really had
found that torn shirt (and how could we have failed to find it in his
chest of drawers or trunk?) that would have been a fact, a material
fact in support of his statement! But he was incapable of that reflection.
<q>I don't remember, it may not have been off my shirt, I
sewed it up in one of my landlady's caps.</q> <q>What sort of a cap?</q> <q>It
was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.</q> <q>And do you remember
that clearly?</q> <q>No, I don't.</q> And he was angry, very angry, and
yet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments
of man's life, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers
just such trifles. He will forget anything but some green
roof that has flashed past him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross&mdash;that
he will remember. He concealed the making of that little
bag from his household, he must have remembered his humiliating
fear that some one might come in and find him needle in hand, how
at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen (there is a screen
in his lodgings).</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these
details, trifles?</q> cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. <q>Just because
the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He
has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago,
he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic
statements; all those are trivialities. <q>You must believe it on my
honor.</q> Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are eager to believe it,
even if only on his word of honor! Are we jackals thirsting for
human blood? Show us a single fact in the prisoner's favor and we
shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion
drawn from the prisoner's expression by his own brother, or that
when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to
the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new fact,
we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to
repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot
repudiate anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as
though he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance,
the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base
motive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency
of the facts.
</p>

<pb n='818'/><anchor id='Pg818'/>

<p>
<q>And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated
counsel for the defense,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding,
<q>whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities,
remember that at this moment you are in a temple of
justice. Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the
champions of our holy Russia, of her principles, her family, everything
that she holds sacred! Yes, you represent Russia here at this
moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but
will reëcho throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia will
hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be encouraged
or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and her
expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps
to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched
out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course.
And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not
from respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from
horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that
they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so and
will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will
check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own
safety, enlightenment and civilization. Already we have heard
voices of alarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not
tempt them! Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence
justifying the murder of a father by his son!</q>
</p>

<p>
Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up
his speech with this rhetorical appeal&mdash;and the effect produced by
him was extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went
out hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the
adjoining room. There was no applause in the court, but serious
persons were pleased. The ladies were not so well satisfied, though
even they were pleased with his eloquence, especially as they had no
apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in
Fetyukovitch. <q>He will speak at last and of course carry all before
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the
prosecutor's speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and
his head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and
listened, especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the
<pb n='819'/><anchor id='Pg819'/>
prosecutor mentioned Rakitin's opinion of her, a smile of contempt
and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly,
<q>The Bernards!</q> When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had
questioned and tortured him at Mokroe, Mitya raised his head and
listened with intense curiosity. At one point he seemed about to
jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his
shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end of the
speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe,
and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. <q>The man could not resist boasting
of his cleverness,</q> they said.
</p>

<p>
The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter
of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation
and exclamations in the audience. I remember some of
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>A weighty speech,</q> a gentleman in one group observed gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>He brought in too much psychology,</q> said another voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>But it was all true, the absolute truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he is first rate at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He summed it all up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he summed us up, too,</q> chimed in another voice. <q>Do you
remember, at the beginning of his speech, making out we were all
like Fyodor Pavlovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And at the end, too. But that was all rot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And obscure too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He was a little too much carried away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's unjust, it's unjust.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it was smartly done, anyway. He's had long to wait, but
he's had his say, ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What will the counsel for the defense say?</q>
</p>

<p>
In another group I heard:
</p>

<p>
<q>He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like
that; <q>appealing to your sensibilities</q>&mdash;do you remember?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that was awkward of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He was in too great a hurry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a nervous man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what must it be for Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
In a third group:
</p>

<pb n='820'/><anchor id='Pg820'/>

<p>
<q>What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the
end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a general's wife, divorced, I know her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's why she has the lorgnette.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is not good for much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.</q>

<p>
<q>Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is
prettier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn't they, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, it was smart enough. We've heard it before, how often he
has told the story at people's houses!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And he couldn't resist doing it now. That's vanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a man with a grievance, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much
rhetoric, such long sentences.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you
remember about the troika? Something about <q>They have Hamlets,
but we have, so far, only Karamazovs!</q> That was cleverly said!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatever he says, he won't get round our peasants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't you think so?</q>
</p>

<p>
A fourth group:
</p>

<p>
<q>What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the
other nations.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And that was true what he said about other nations not standing
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and
speaking about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not
high time to intervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was
thinking of him, I know he was. He was talking about that last
week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not an easy job.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not an easy job? Why not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, we'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn.
Where would they get it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='821'/><anchor id='Pg821'/>

<p>
<q>In America. They get it from America now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q>
</p>

<p>
But the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch
mounted the tribune.

<head>Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways</head>

<p>
All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out.
The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began
very simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the
slightest trace of conceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at
pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a man speaking in a circle
of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice was a fine one,
sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine and
simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that
the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and <q>pierce the
heart with untold power.</q> His language was perhaps more irregular
than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he spoke without long phrases, and
indeed, with more precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he
kept bending forward, especially at the beginning of his speech, not
exactly bowing, but as though he were about to dart at his listeners,
bending his long spine in half, as though there were a spring in the
middle that enabled him to bend almost at right angles.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly,
without system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though,
at the end, these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided
into two parts, the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the
charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half
he suddenly changed his tone, and even his manner, and at once
rose to pathos. The audience seemed on the look-out for it, and
quivered with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although
he practiced in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial
towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or
<pb n='822'/><anchor id='Pg822'/>
at least a preconceived idea. <q>That is what has happened to me in
the present case,</q> he explained. <q>From the very first accounts in
the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed
me in the prisoner's favor. What interested me most was a
fact which often occurs in legal practice, but rarely, I think, in such
an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case. I ought to
formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech, but I will
do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to work
directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my material.
That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it's sincere.
What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of
evidence against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that
will stand criticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the
case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed,
and I suddenly received from the prisoner's relatives a request
to undertake his defense. I at once hurried here, and here I
became completely convinced. It was to break down this terrible
chain of facts, and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately
was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the case.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Fetyukovitch began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> he suddenly protested, <q>I am new to this
district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of
turbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has
insulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced
many people against him beforehand. Of course I recognize that
the moral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him.
The prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper. Yet he was received
in society here; he was even welcome in the family of my
talented friend, the prosecutor.</q>
</p>

<p>
(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,
quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that
the prosecutor received Mitya against his will, solely because he had
somehow interested his wife&mdash;a lady of the highest virtue and moral
worth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her husband,
especially in trifles. Mitya's visits, however, had not been frequent.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I venture to suggest,</q> Fetyukovitch continued,
<q>that in spite of his independent mind and just character, my
opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate
<pb n='823'/><anchor id='Pg823'/>
client. Oh, that is so natural; the unfortunate man has only
too well deserved such prejudice. Outraged morality, and still more
outraged taste, is often relentless. We have, in the talented prosecutor's
speech, heard a stern analysis of the prisoner's character and
conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the case was evident.
And, what's more, he went into psychological subtleties into which
he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and malicious
prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are
even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious
and consciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away
by the artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a
romance, especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight.
Before I started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg,
and was myself aware, that I should find here a talented opponent
whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained him peculiar
renown in legal circles of recent years. But profound as psychology
is, it's a knife that cuts both ways.</q> (Laughter among the public.)
<q rend='pre'>You will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can't boast of eloquence.
But I will take as an example any point in the prosecutor's
speech.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed
over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down
with a brass pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent
five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he had killed
him or not. And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's
statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity. <q>No,</q> he says,
<q>such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that's unnatural;
he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead
or alive, and so showed that he had committed the murder, since he
would not have run back for any other reason.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method
and apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be
no less probable. The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out,
as a precaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he had left
in his murdered father's study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an
amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope, with an
inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it. <q>If he
had carried that envelope away with him, no one in the world would
<pb n='824'/><anchor id='Pg824'/>
have known of that envelope and of the notes in it, and that the
money had been stolen by the prisoner.</q> Those are the prosecutor's
own words. So on one side you see a complete absence of precaution,
a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright, leaving that
clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed another
man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating
foresight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological
subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances
I become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle,
while at the next I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so
bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only
run back to find out whether he is alive to witness against me, why
should I spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk
of encountering other witnesses? Why soak my handkerchief, wiping
the blood off his head so that it may be evidence against me
later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why not hit the
servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill
him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he
left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had
taken from the two women, and which they could always recognize
afterwards as theirs, and prove that he had taken it from them.
And it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it
through carelessness or haste, no, he had flung away his weapon, for
it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay. Why did he do
so? Just because he was grieved at having killed a man, an old
servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous
weapon. That's how it must have been, what other reason could he
have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling
grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent
of his father's murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have
run to another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently;
his thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation.
He would have had none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt.
On the contrary, he would have broken his skull instead of spending
five minutes looking after him. There was room for pity and good-feeling
just because his conscience had been clear till then. Here
we have a different psychology. I have purposely resorted to this
<pb n='825'/><anchor id='Pg825'/>
method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything
by it. It all depends on who makes use of it. Psychology
lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously.
I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor,
were again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in
detail; I will only quote some passages from it, some leading points.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery</head>

<p>
There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch's
speech. He flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand
roubles, and consequently, the possibility of their having been
stolen.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> he began. <q rend='pre'>Every new and unprejudiced
observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the
present case, namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility
of proving that there was anything to be stolen. We are
told that money was stolen&mdash;three thousand roubles&mdash;but whether
those roubles ever existed, nobody knows. Consider, how have we
heard of that sum, and who has seen the notes? The only person
who saw them, and stated that they had been put in the envelope,
was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the prisoner
and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe. Madame
Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three persons
had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and that
Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time?
What if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put
them back in his cash-box without telling him? Note, that according
to Smerdyakov's story the notes were kept under the mattress;
the prisoner must have pulled them out, and yet the bed was absolutely
unrumpled; that is carefully recorded in the protocol. How
could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the
<pb n='826'/><anchor id='Pg826'/>
bed? How could he have helped soiling with his blood-stained hands
the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely
made?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes,
it's worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat
surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor
declare of himself&mdash;of himself, observe&mdash;that but for that envelope,
but for its being left on the floor, no one in the world would have
known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it, and
therefore of the prisoner's having stolen it. And so that torn scrap
of paper is, by the prosecutor's own admission, the sole proof on
which the charge of robbery rests, <q>otherwise no one would have
known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.</q> But is the
mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof
that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?
Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the
envelope. But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask
you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen
the notes two days before the catastrophe. Then why not imagine
that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient and
hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration, may have
whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out
the notes. <q>What's the use of the envelope?</q> he may have asked
himself. <q>She won't believe the notes are there, but when I show
her the thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more
impression, you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.</q> And
so he tears open the envelope, takes out the money, and flings the
envelope on the floor, conscious of being the owner and untroubled
by any fears of leaving evidence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this
theory and such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if
anything of the sort could have taken place, the charge of robbery
falls to the ground; if there was no money, there was no theft of it.
If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had
been money in it, why may I not maintain the opposite, that the
envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it
by its owner?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch
<pb n='827'/><anchor id='Pg827'/>
took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the
police searched the house? In the first place, part of the money
was found in the cash-box, and secondly, he might have taken it
out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of
it, to give or send it away; he may have changed his idea, his plan
of action completely, without thinking it necessary to announce the
fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is the barest possibility
of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so positively
accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and
of having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on
the domain of romance. If it is maintained that something has
been stolen, the thing must be produced, or at least its existence
must be proved beyond doubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly
more than a boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger,
went in broad daylight into a moneychanger's shop with an ax, and
with extraordinary, typical audacity killed the master of the shop
and carried off fifteen hundred roubles. Five hours later he was
arrested, and, except fifteen roubles he had already managed to spend,
the whole sum was found on him. Moreover, the shopman, on his
return to the shop after the murder, informed the police not only
of the exact sum stolen, but even of the notes and gold coins of
which that sum was made up, and those very notes and coins were
found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and genuine
confession on the part of the murderer. That's what I call evidence,
gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch
the money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present
case? And yet it is a question of life and death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering
money; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles&mdash;where
did he get the money? But the very fact that only fifteen
hundred could be found, and the other half of the sum could nowhere
be discovered, shows that that money was not the same, and
had never been in any envelope. By strict calculation of time it
was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight
from those women servants to Perhotin's without going home, and
that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in company
and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and
<pb n='828'/><anchor id='Pg828'/>
hidden half in the town. It's just this consideration that has led the
prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at
Mokroe. Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen?
Isn't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic?
And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the whole charge of
robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case what could have
become of the other fifteen hundred roubles? By what miracle could
they have disappeared, since it's proved the prisoner went nowhere
else? And we are ready to ruin a man's life with such tales!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the
fifteen hundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without
money before that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner
has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that
