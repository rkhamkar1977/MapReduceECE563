it's not so, it turns out that it does make a difference. Believe me,
gentlemen, what has tortured me most during this night has not
been the thought that I'd killed the old servant, and that I was in
danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded, and Heaven
was open to me again. Oh, that did torture me, but not in the same
way: not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that
damned money off my breast at last and spent it, and had become a
downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you again, with a bleeding
heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I have learnt that it's
not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but impossible to die a
scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in
spite of his being intensely excited.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> the
prosecutor said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone.
<q>But all this, if you'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves,
in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves, that's what it is.
And why, for instance, should you not have saved yourself such
misery for almost a month, by going and returning that fifteen
hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you? And why could
you not have explained things to her, and in view of your position,
which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had
recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to
one's mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her,
why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for
your expenses, which, with her generous heart, she would certainly
not have refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with
some guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant
Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I suppose you still
regard that security as of value?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly crimsoned.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as
that? You can't be speaking in earnest?</q> he said, with indignation,
<pb n='558'/><anchor id='Pg558'/>
looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to
believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you I'm in earnest.... Why do you imagine I'm not
serious?</q> It was the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know,
you are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I'll
confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and
you'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which
a medley of human passions can sink. You must know that I already
had that plan myself, that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor!
Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this
current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya&mdash;I
was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to tell her of my
treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out, for the expenses
of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to beg,
do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the
other, the rival, who hated and insulted her&mdash;to think of it! You
must be mad, prosecutor!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ...
of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this
case, as you assert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,</q>
said the prosecutor, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>But that would have been so infamous!</q> Mitya brought his
fist down on the table fiercely. <q>That would have been filthy beyond
everything! Yes, do you know that she might have given me
that money, yes, and she would have given it, too; she'd have been
certain to give it, to be revenged on me, she'd have given it to
satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me, for hers is an
infernal nature, too, and she's a woman of great wrath. I'd have
taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have
taken it, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive
me, gentlemen, I'm making such an outcry because I've had that
thought in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday, that
night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards
yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till what happened?</q> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively,
but Mitya did not hear it.
</p>

<pb n='559'/><anchor id='Pg559'/>

<p>
<q>I have made you an awful confession,</q> Mitya said gloomily in
conclusion. <q>You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must
respect it, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then you've
simply no respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die
of shame at having confessed it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot
myself! Yes, I see, I see already that you don't believe me. What,
you want to write that down, too?</q> he cried in dismay.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what you said just now,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking
at him in surprise, <q>that is, that up to the last hour you were still
contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from
her.... I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence
for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and
particularly for you, particularly important for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have mercy, gentlemen!</q> Mitya flung up his hands. <q>Don't
write that, anyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart
asunder before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering
the wounds in both halves.... Oh, my God!</q>
</p>

<p>
In despair he hid his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> observed the
prosecutor, <q>everything that is written down will be read over to
you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you like.
But now I'll ask you one little question for the second time. Has no
one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed
up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to believe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one, no one, I told you so before, or you've not understood
anything! Let me alone!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's
plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a
dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted
almost everywhere about the three thousand you'd spent here;
three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you got
hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to
understand that you had brought three thousand with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred
witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!</q>
cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word <emph>all</emph> means
something.</q>
</p>

<pb n='560'/><anchor id='Pg560'/>

<p>
<q>It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what need had you to <q>talk rot,</q> as you call it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted
so much money.... To try and forget that money I had sewn
up, perhaps ... yes, that was why ... damn it ... how often
will you ask me that question? Well, I told a fib, and that was
the end of it, once I'd said it, I didn't care to correct it. What does
a man tell lies for sometimes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes
a man tell lies,</q> observed the prosecutor impressively. <q>Tell me,
though, was that <q>amulet,</q> as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not big.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How big, for instance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the
size.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them
somewhere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck?
According to your own evidence you didn't go home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I
tore it off my neck and took out the money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the dark?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in
one minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Without scissors, in the street?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an
old rag. It was torn in a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did you put it afterwards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I dropped it there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where was it, exactly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows
whereabouts. What do you want to know for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would
be material evidence in your favor. How is it you don't understand
that? Who helped you to sew it up a month ago?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one helped me. I did it myself.</q>
</p>

<pb n='561'/><anchor id='Pg561'/>

<p>
<q>Can you sew?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed
to do that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you
sewed the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you laughing at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know where I got the rag from&mdash;somewhere, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have thought you couldn't have forgotten it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word, I don't remember. I might have torn a bit off
my linen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow
the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag.
What sort of rag was it, cloth or linen?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe
I didn't tear it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe
I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady's.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In your landlady's cap?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I took it from her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How did you get it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to
wipe my pen on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless
rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it.
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece of
calico, washed a thousand times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you remember that for certain now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap.
But, hang it, what does it matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was
lost?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you,
an old rag not worth a farthing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where did you get the needle and thread?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!</q> said Mitya,
losing his temper at last.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where
you threw the pieces in the market-place.</q>
</p>

<pb n='562'/><anchor id='Pg562'/>

<p>
<q>Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and
perhaps you'll find it,</q> said Mitya, sneering. <q>Enough, gentlemen,
enough!</q> he decided, in an exhausted voice. <q>I see you don't believe
me! Not for a moment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not to
have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing
my secret to you? It's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes.
You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a hymn of triumph if you
can.... Damn you, you torturers!</q>
</p>

<p>
He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were
silent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost
vacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and
he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was
happening. In the meantime they had to finish what they were
about. They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It
was by now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had been
extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who
had been continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation
had been going on, had now both gone out again. The
lawyers, too, looked very tired. It was a wretched morning, the
whole sky was overcast, and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls.
Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I look out of the window?</q> he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch,
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, as much as you like,</q> the latter replied.
</p>

<p>
Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed
against its little greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just
below the house, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of
poor, black, dismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the
rain. Mitya thought of <q>Phœbus the golden-haired,</q> and how he
had meant to shoot himself at his first ray. <q>Perhaps it would be
even better on a morning like this,</q> he thought with a smile, and
suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his <q>torturers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he cried, <q>I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me
about her, I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me?
She's innocent, you know, she was out of her mind when she cried
last night <q>It's all my fault!</q> She's done nothing, nothing! I've
been grieving over her all night as I sat with you.... Can't you,
won't you tell me what you are going to do with her now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='563'/><anchor id='Pg563'/>

<p>
<q>You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch,</q> the prosecutor answered at once, with evident
alacrity. <q>We have, so far, no grounds for interfering with the
lady in whom you are so interested. I trust that it may be the same
in the later development of the case.... On the contrary, we'll do
everything that lies in our power in that matter. Set your mind
completely at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward
people in spite of everything. You've taken a load off my
heart.... Well, what are we to do now? I'm ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the
witnesses without delay. That must be done in your presence and
therefore&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't we have some tea first?</q> interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch,
<q>I think we've deserved it!</q>
</p>

<p>
They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch
had, no doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a
glass and then <q>go on and on,</q> putting off their proper breakfast
until a more favorable opportunity. Tea really was ready below,
and was soon brought up. Mitya at first refused the glass that
Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him, but afterwards he asked
for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked surprisingly exhausted.
It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength
that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent
emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he
could hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects
about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. <q>A little
more and I shall begin raving,</q> he said to himself.

<head>Chapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The Babe</head>

<p>
The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue
our story in such detail as before. And so we will not
dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness
called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and
<pb n='564'/><anchor id='Pg564'/>
conscience, and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence
on oath, how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of
his evidence, and so on. We will only note that the point principally
insisted upon in the examination was the question of the
three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here, at Mokroe,
by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand or
fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen
hundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned
out to be against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some
witnesses introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of
his, Mitya's, story.
</p>

<p>
The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not
in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the
contrary, an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused,
which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity.
He spoke little, and with reserve, waited to be questioned, answered
precisely and deliberately. Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness
that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than
three thousand, that all the peasants about here would testify that
they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by Dmitri
Fyodorovitch himself. <q>What a lot of money he flung away on
the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them
alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't believe I gave them five hundred,</q> was Mitya's gloomy
comment on this. <q>It's a pity I didn't count the money at the
time, but I was drunk....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He
listened gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though
he would say:
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly. <q>You flung it about at random
and they picked it up. They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers,
they've been driven away from here, or maybe they'd bear
witness themselves how much they got from you. I saw the sum
in your hands, myself&mdash;count it I didn't, you didn't let me, that's
true enough&mdash;but by the look of it I should say it was far more than
<pb n='565'/><anchor id='Pg565'/>
fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! We've seen money
too. We can judge of amounts....</q>
</p>

<p>
As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had told him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three
thousand with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?</q> replied Mitya.
<q>Surely I didn't declare so positively that I'd brought three thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey.
Andrey himself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when
you were treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you
would leave your sixth thousand here&mdash;that is with what you spent
before, we must understand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and
Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too, was standing beside you at the time.
Maybe he'd remember it....</q>
</p>

<p>
The evidence as to the <q>sixth</q> thousand made an extraordinary
impression on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new
mode of reckoning; three and three made six, three thousand then
and three now made six, that was clear.
</p>

<p>
They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch,
Stepan and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The
peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch's
evidence. They noted down, with particular care, Andrey's
account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the road:
<q><q>Where,</q> says he, <q>am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going, to heaven or
to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle
smile, and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where
Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be <q>included in the case.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored,
and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met
them before in his life, though they were acquaintances whom he
had been meeting every day for a long time past. He began by
saying that <q>he knew nothing about it and didn't want to.</q> But it
appeared that he had heard of the <q>sixth</q> thousand, and he admitted
that he had been standing close by at the moment. As far
as he could see he <q>didn't know</q> how much money Mitya had in his
<pb n='566'/><anchor id='Pg566'/>
hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply
to reiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned
out, Mitya's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved,
and that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of
Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect, as though she
had been a lady of the best society, and did not once allow himself
to call her Grushenka. In spite of the young man's obvious repugnance
at giving evidence, Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great
length, and only from him learnt all the details of what made up
Mitya's <q>romance,</q> so to say, on that night. Mitya did not once
pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go, and he left
the room with unconcealed indignation.
</p>

<p>
The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed
in their room, they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of
the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that
they would certainly be sent for. They gave their evidence with
dignity, though not without some uneasiness. The little Pole turned
out to be a retired official of the twelfth class, who had served in
Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name was Mussyalovitch. Pan
Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist. Although
Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room
they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was
standing on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most
important person and in command, and addressed him at every word
as <q>Pan Colonel.</q> Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch
himself, they grasped that they had to address their answers
to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It turned out that they could speak
Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words. Of
his relations with Grushenka, past and present, Pan Mussyalovitch
spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at once and
declared that he would not allow the <q>scoundrel</q> to speak like that
in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the
word <q>scoundrel</q> and begged that it should be put down in the
protocol. Mitya fumed with rage.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And
put down, too, that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he's
a scoundrel!</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he
<pb n='567'/><anchor id='Pg567'/>
showed the most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly
reprimanding Mitya, he cut short all further inquiry into the
romantic aspect of the case, and hastened to pass to what was
essential. One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special
interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very room, Mitya had
tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him three thousand
roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down, and
the remaining two thousand three hundred <q>to be paid next day
in the town.</q> He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole
sum with him at Mokroe, but that his money was in the town.
Mitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure
to pay him the remainder next day in the town. But Pan Vrublevsky
confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after thinking for a moment
admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the Poles stated,
that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have said so.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It
seemed to establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base
this deduction on it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that
had come into Mitya's hands might really have been left somewhere
hidden in the town, or even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe.
This would explain the circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution,
that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya's hands.
This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which, insignificant
as it was, had hitherto told, to some extent, in Mitya's
favor. Now this one piece of evidence in his favor had broken
down. In answer to the prosecutor's inquiry, where he would have
got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he
himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently
replied that he had meant to offer the <q>little chap,</q> not
money, but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village
of Tchermashnya, those rights which he had already offered to
Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov. The prosecutor positively smiled
at the <q>innocence of this subterfuge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute
for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He certainly would have accepted it,</q> Mitya declared warmly.
<q>Why, look here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four
or six, for it. He would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on
<pb n='568'/><anchor id='Pg568'/>
to the job, and might have got, not three thousand, but the whole
property out of the old man.</q>
</p>

<p>
The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the
protocol in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The
incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay
Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them, as it was, and did not
want to worry them with trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a
foolish, drunken quarrel over cards. There had been drinking and
disorder enough, that night.... So the two hundred roubles remained
in the pockets of the Poles.
</p>

<p>
Then old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached
with little steps, looking very disheveled and depressed.
He had, all this time, taken refuge below with Grushenka, sitting
dumbly beside her, and <q>now and then he'd begin blubbering over
her and wiping his eyes with a blue check handkerchief,</q> as Mihail
Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she herself began trying
to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once confessed that he
had done wrong, that he had borrowed <q>ten roubles in my poverty,</q>
from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.
To Nikolay Parfenovitch's direct question, had he noticed how
much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have
been able to see the sum better than any one when he took the note
from him, Maximov, in the most positive manner, declared that there
was twenty thousand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?</q>
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged
my little property. She'd only let me look at it from a distance,
boasting of it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored
notes. And Dmitri Fyodorovitch's were all rainbow-colored....</q>
</p>

<p>
He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka's turn. Nikolay
Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance
might have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition
to him, but Mitya bowed his head in silence, giving him to
understand <q>that he would not make a scene.</q> Mihail Makarovitch
himself led Grushenka in. She entered with a stern and gloomy
face, that looked almost composed and sat down quietly on the
<pb n='569'/><anchor id='Pg569'/>
chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very pale, she
seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent
black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish chill&mdash;the
first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her
grave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very
favorable impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even
a little bit <q>fascinated.</q> He admitted himself, when talking about
it afterwards, that only then had he seen <q>how handsome the woman
was,</q> for, though he had seen her several times before, he had always
looked upon her as something of a <q>provincial hetaira.</q> <q>She
has the manners of the best society,</q> he said enthusiastically, gossiping
about her in a circle of ladies. But this was received with positive
indignation by the ladies, who immediately called him a
<q>naughty man,</q> to his great satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
As she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant
at Mitya, who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him
at once. After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay
Parfenovitch asked her, hesitating a little, but preserving the most
courteous manner, on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov. To this Grushenka firmly and
quietly replied:
</p>

<p>
<q>He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance
during the last month.</q> To further inquisitive questions she answered
plainly and with complete frankness, that, though <q>at times</q>
she had thought him attractive, she had not loved him, but had won
his heart as well as his old father's <q>in my nasty spite,</q> that she had
seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every
one else; but that had only amused her. She had never meant to go
to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been laughing at him. <q>I
had no thoughts for either of them all this last month. I was expecting
another man who had wronged me. But I think,</q> she said
in conclusion, <q>that there's no need for you to inquire about that,
nor for me to answer you, for that's my own affair.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He
again dismissed the <q>romantic</q> aspect of the case and passed to the
serious one, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning
the three thousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the statement
that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first
<pb n='570'/><anchor id='Pg570'/>
carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had not counted the money
herself, she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri
Fyodorovitch's own lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you
only hear him speak of it to others in your presence?</q> the prosecutor
inquired immediately.
</p>

<p>
To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before
other people, and had heard him say so when they were alone.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?</q> inquired the
prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too,
where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had got it from Katerina Ivanovna.
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month
ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had saved half that sum for his own use?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never heard that,</q> answered Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often
told her that he hadn't a farthing.
</p>

<p>
<q>He was always expecting to get some from his father,</q> said
Grushenka in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of
irritation,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, <q>that he intended
to make an attempt on his father's life?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, he did say so,</q> sighed Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
<q>Once or several times?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He mentioned it several times, always in anger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you believe he would do it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never believed it,</q> she answered firmly. <q>I had faith in
his noble heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, allow me,</q> cried Mitya suddenly, <q>allow me to say
one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can speak,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.
</p>

<p>
<q>Agrafena Alexandrovna!</q> Mitya got up from his chair, <q>have
faith in God and in me. I am not guilty of my father's murder!</q>
</p>

<p>
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair.
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon.
<pb n='571'/><anchor id='Pg571'/>
<q>Thanks be to Thee, O Lord,</q> she said, in a voice thrilled with
emotion, and still standing, she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and
added:
</p>

<p>
<q>As he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. He'll say anything
as a joke or from obstinacy, but he'll never deceive you against
his conscience. He's telling the whole truth, you may believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you've given me fresh courage,</q>
Mitya responded in a quivering voice.
</p>

<p>
As to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she
did not know what sum it was, but had heard him tell several people
that he had three thousand with him. And to the question where he
got the money, she said that he had told her that he had <q>stolen</q>
it from Katerina Ivanovna, and that she had replied to that that
he hadn't stolen it, and that he must pay the money back next day.
On the prosecutor's asking her emphatically whether the money
he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent
yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, she declared
that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that
was how she understood him.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed
her impulsively that she might at once return to the town
and that if he could be of any assistance to her, with horses for
example, or if she would care for an escort, he ... would be&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you sincerely,</q> said Grushenka, bowing to him, <q>I'm
going with this old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with
me, and meanwhile, if you'll allow me, I'll wait below to hear what
you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful,
but only for a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a
strange physical weakness. His eyes were closing with fatigue.
The examination of the witnesses was, at last, over. They proceeded
to a final revision of the protocol. Mitya got up, moved
from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large
chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place
and the time.
</p>

<p>
He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been
stationed long ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a
<pb n='572'/><anchor id='Pg572'/>
pair of horses, through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in
November, and the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as
soon as it touched the earth. And the peasant drove him smartly,
he had a fair, long beard. He was not an old man, somewhere about
fifty, and he had on a gray peasant's smock. Not far off was a
village, he could see the black huts, and half the huts were burnt
down, there were only the charred beams sticking up. And as
they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road,
a lot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a
sort of brownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman,
who looked forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long
thin face. And in her arms was a little baby crying. And her
breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in
them. And the child cried and cried, and held out its little bare
arms, with its little fists blue from cold.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are they crying? Why are they crying?</q> Mitya asked, as
they dashed gayly by.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's the babe,</q> answered the driver, <q>the babe weeping.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, <q>the
babe,</q> and he liked the peasant's calling it a <q>babe.</q> There seemed
more pity in it.
</p>

<p>
<q>But why is it weeping?</q> Mitya persisted stupidly, <q>why are its
little arms bare? Why don't they wrap it up?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The babe's cold, its little clothes are frozen and don't warm it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why is it? Why?</q> foolish Mitya still persisted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, they're poor people, burnt out. They've no bread. They're
begging because they've been burnt out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no,</q> Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. <q>Tell me
why it is those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor?
Why is the babe poor? Why is the steppe barren? Why don't they
hug each other and kiss? Why don't they sing songs of joy? Why
are they so dark from black misery? Why don't they feed the
babe?</q>
</p>

<p>
And he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and
senseless, yet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in
that way. And he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never
known before, was rising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that
he wanted to do something for them all, so that the babe should
<pb n='573'/><anchor id='Pg573'/>
weep no more, so that the dark-faced, dried-up mother should not
weep, that no one should shed tears again from that moment, and
he wanted to do it at once, at once, regardless of all obstacles, with
all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I'm coming with you. I won't leave you now for the rest
of my life, I'm coming with you,</q> he heard close beside him
Grushenka's tender voice, thrilling with emotion. And his heart
glowed, and he struggled forward towards the light, and he longed
to live, to live, to go on and on, towards the new, beckoning light,
and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!
</p>

<p>
<q>What! Where?</q> he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up
on the chest, as though he had revived from a swoon, smiling
brightly. Nikolay Parfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting
that he should hear the protocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya
guessed that he had been asleep an hour or more, but he did not hear
Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was suddenly struck by the fact that
there was a pillow under his head, which hadn't been there when he
had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?</q> he
cried, with a sort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as
though some great kindness had been shown him.
</p>

<p>
He never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the
peasant witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch's little secretary, had
compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head; but his
whole soul was quivering with tears. He went to the table and said
that he would sign whatever they liked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've had a good dream, gentlemen,</q> he said in a strange voice,
with a new light, as of joy, in his face.

<head>Chapter IX. They Carry Mitya Away</head>

<p>
When the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch
turned solemnly to the prisoner and read him the <q>Committal,</q>
setting forth, that in such a year, on such a day, in such
a place, the investigating lawyer of such-and-such a district court,
<pb n='574'/><anchor id='Pg574'/>
having examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya) accused of this and of
that (all the charges were carefully written out) and having considered
that the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges made
against him, had brought forward nothing in his defense, while the
witnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such
testify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such
articles of the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order
to preclude so-and-so (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit
and judgment he be detained in such-and-such a prison, which he
hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this
same <q>Committal</q> to the deputy prosecutor, and so on, and so on.
</p>

<p>
In brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a
prisoner, and that he would be driven at once to the town, and there
shut up in a very unpleasant place. Mitya listened attentively, and
only shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, gentlemen, I don't blame you. I'm ready.... I understand
that there's nothing else for you to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be
escorted at once by the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch,
who happened to be on the spot....
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable
feeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, we're all cruel, we're all monsters, we all make men
weep, and mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be
settled here, now, of all I am the lowest reptile! I've sworn to
amend, and every day I've done the same filthy things. I understand
now that such men as I need a blow, a blow of destiny to
catch them as with a noose, and bind them by a force from without.
Never, never should I have risen of myself! But the thunderbolt
has fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my public shame,
I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps I shall
be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am not
guilty of my father's blood. I accept my punishment, not because
I killed him, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps I really
might have killed him. Still I mean to fight it out with you. I
warn you of that. I'll fight it out with you to the end, and then
God will decide. Good-by, gentlemen, don't be vexed with me for
having shouted at you during the examination. Oh, I was still
<pb n='575'/><anchor id='Pg575'/>
such a fool then.... In another minute I shall be a prisoner, but
now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri Karamazov offers you
his hand. Saying good-by to you, I say it to all men.</q>
</p>

<p>
His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay
Parfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden,
almost nervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya
instantly noticed this, and started. He let his outstretched hand
fall at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
faltered, somewhat embarrassed. <q>We will continue it in the town,
and I, for my part, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in
your defense.... As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
I've always been disposed to regard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate
than guilty. All of us here, if I may make bold to speak
for all, we are all ready to recognize that you are, at bottom, a young
man of honor, but, alas, one who has been carried away by certain
passions to a somewhat excessive degree....</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch's little figure was positively majestic by
the time he had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another
minute this <q>boy</q> would take his arm, lead him to another corner,
and renew their conversation about <q>girls.</q> But many quite irrelevant
and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner
when he is being led out to execution.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see <emph>her</emph> to say
<q>good-by</q> for the last time?</q> asked Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it's impossible except
in the presence of&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few
words, and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka
made a deep bow to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow
you for ever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless,
though you've been your own undoing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my
love.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went
<pb n='576'/><anchor id='Pg576'/>
out. He was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch
on him. At the bottom of the steps to which he had driven up
with such a dash the day before with Andrey's three horses, two
carts stood in readiness. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set
man with a wrinkled face, was annoyed about something, some
sudden irregularity. He was shouting angrily. He asked Mitya
to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.
</p>

<p>
<q>When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a
different face,</q> thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was
a crowd of people, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch
came down the steps too. All stared at Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me at parting, good people!</q> Mitya shouted suddenly
from the cart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive us too!</q> he heard two or three voices.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was, perhaps,
too busy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about something.
It appeared that everything was not yet ready in the second cart,
in which two constables were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch.
The peasant who had been ordered to drive the second cart was
pulling on his smock, stoutly maintaining that it was not his turn
to go, but Akim's. But Akim was not to be seen. They ran to
look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They've
no shame!</q> exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. <q>Akim gave you
twenty-five copecks the day before yesterday. You've drunk it
all and now you cry out. I'm simply surprised at your good-nature,
with our low peasants, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, that's all I can say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what do we want a second cart for?</q> Mitya put in. <q>Let's
start with the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I won't be unruly,
I won't run away from you, old fellow. What do we want an
escort for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you've never
been taught. I'm not <q>old fellow</q> to you, and you can keep your
advice for another time!</q> Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out
savagely, as though glad to vent his wrath.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment
later he felt suddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull
<pb n='577'/><anchor id='Pg577'/>
sky was still overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing
straight in his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've taken a chill,</q> thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down
heavily, and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into
the corner. It is true that he was out of humor and greatly disliked
the task that had been laid upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Trifon Borissovitch!</q> Mitya shouted again, and felt
himself, that he had not called out this time from good-nature, but
involuntarily, from resentment.
</p>

<p>
But Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind
his back, and staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face,
he made no reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by!</q> he heard all at once
the voice of Kalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up
to the cart he held out his hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.
</p>

<p>
Mitya had time to seize and press his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, dear fellow! I shan't forget your generosity,</q> he cried
warmly.
</p>

<p>
But the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began
ringing and Mitya was driven off.
</p>

<p>
Kalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his
face in his hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat
like that, crying as though he were a little boy instead of a young
man of twenty. Oh, he believed almost without doubt in Mitya's
guilt.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are these people? What can men be after this?</q> he exclaimed
incoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that
moment he had no desire to live.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it worth it? Is it worth it?</q> exclaimed the boy in his grief.

<head>Chapter I. Kolya Krassotkin</head>

<p>
It was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost,
eleven degrees Réaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow
had fallen on the frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry
wind was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our
town, especially about the market-place. It was a dull morning,
but the snow had ceased.
</p>

<p>
Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov's shop, there
stood a small house, very clean both without and within. It belonged
to Madame Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial
secretary, who had been dead for fourteen years. His widow, still a
nice-looking woman of thirty-two, was living in her neat little
house on her private means. She lived in respectable seclusion; she
was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition. She was about eighteen
at the time of her husband's death; she had been married only a year
and had just borne him a son. From the day of his death she had
devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her precious
treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionately
those fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than
happiness. She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost
every day, afraid he would fall ill, would catch cold, do something
naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When
Kolya began going to school, the mother devoted herself to studying
all the sciences with him so as to help him, and go through his
lessons with him. She hastened to make the acquaintance of the
teachers and their wives, even made up to Kolya's schoolfellows,
<pb n='579'/><anchor id='Pg579'/>
and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being
teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far that the boys
actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him with
being a <q>mother's darling.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy,
<q>tremendously strong,</q> as was rumored in his class, and soon proved
to be the fact; he was agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and
enterprising temper. He was good at lessons, and there was a
rumor in the school that he could beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at
arithmetic and universal history. Though he looked down upon
every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious. He accepted
his schoolfellows' respect as his due, but was friendly with them.
Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himself
on occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped
that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an
unpardonable breach of discipline. But he was as fond of mischief
on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school, and
not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation,
inventing something, something effective and conspicuous. He was
extremely vain. He knew how to make even his mother give way
to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her. She gave
way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The one
thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love
for her. She was always fancying that Kolya was <q>unfeeling</q> to
her, and at times, dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach
him with his coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more
demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him the more he seemed
intentionally to avoid them. Yet it was not intentional on his part
but instinctive&mdash;it was his character. His mother was mistaken;
he was very fond of her. He only disliked <q>sheepish sentimentality,</q>
as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.
</p>

<p>
There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that
had been his father's. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read
several of them by himself. His mother did not mind that and only
wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase
poring over a book instead of going to play. And in that way
Kolya read some things unsuitable for his age.
</p>

<p>
Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his
<pb n='580'/><anchor id='Pg580'/>
mischief, he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother
serious alarm. It is true there was nothing vicious in what he did,
but a wild mad recklessness.
</p>

<p>
It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the
mother and son went to another district, forty-five miles away, to
spend a week with a distant relation, whose husband was an official
at the railway station (the very station, the nearest one to our town,
from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for
Moscow). There Kolya began by carefully investigating every
detail connected with the railways, knowing that he could impress
his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired knowledge.
But there happened to be some other boys in the place with
whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the
station, others in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them,
all between twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our
town. The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day of
Kolya's stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish boys.
Kolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked
down upon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity or
by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down
between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due,
and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him
at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation,
from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between
the rails that the train could pass over without touching, but to lie
there was no joke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At
first they laughed at him, called him a little liar, a braggart, but
that only egged him on. What piqued him most was that these boys
of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously, and were
at first disposed to treat him as <q>a small boy,</q> not fit to associate
with them, and that was an unendurable insult.
</p>

<p>
And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from
the station, so that the train might have time to get up full speed
after leaving the station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark
night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down
between the rails. The five others who had taken the bet waited
among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with
suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last they
<pb n='581'/><anchor id='Pg581'/>
heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.
Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared
as it approached.
</p>

<p>
<q>Run, run away from the rails,</q> the boys cried to Kolya from the
bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted
up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving.
They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got
up and walked away without a word. Then he explained that he
had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them, but the
fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed long
after to his mother. In this way his reputation as <q>a desperate character,</q>
was established for ever. He returned home to the station as
white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervous fever,
but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. The incident
did not become known at once, but when they came back to
the town it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of
the masters. But then Kolya's mother hastened to entreat the
masters on her boy's behalf, and in the end Dardanelov, a respected
and influential teacher, exerted himself in his favor, and the affair
was ignored.
</p>

<p>
Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately
in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had
once already, about a year previously, ventured, trembling with fear
and the delicacy of his sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his
hand in marriage. But she refused him resolutely, feeling that to
accept him would be an act of treachery to her son, though Dardanelov
had, to judge from certain mysterious symptoms, reason for
believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming but
too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya's mad prank seemed to
have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for his intercession
by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, was a
faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and
delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly
happy. He was fond of the boy, though he would have felt
it beneath him to try and win him over, and was severe and strict
with him in class. Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance.
He learned his lessons perfectly; he was second in his class, was reserved
with Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that
<pb n='582'/><anchor id='Pg582'/>
Kolya was so good at universal history that he could <q>beat</q> even
Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, <q>Who founded
Troy?</q> to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring
to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the
period, to the mythical legends. But the question, <q>Who had
founded Troy?</q> that is, what individuals, he could not answer, and
even for some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous.
But the boys remained convinced that Dardanelov did not know
who founded Troy. Kolya had read of the founders of Troy in
Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in his father's
bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the question,
who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell
his secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.
</p>

<p>
After the incident on the railway a certain change came over
Kolya's attitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame
Krassotkin) heard of her son's exploit, she almost went out of her
mind with horror. She had such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting
with intervals for several days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at
last, promised on his honor that such pranks should never be repeated.
He swore on his knees before the holy image, and swore by the
memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin's instance, and the
<q>manly</q> Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And all that day
the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other's arms
sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as <q>unfeeling</q> as before, but he
had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even
brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was
a scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as
it turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in
it. But of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but
the more uneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov.
It must be noted that Kolya understood and divined what
was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised him profoundly
for his <q>feelings</q>; he had in the past been so tactless as to show this
contempt before his mother, hinting vaguely that he knew what
Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the railway incident
his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not allow
himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more
<pb n='583'/><anchor id='Pg583'/>
respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive
woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the
slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya's presence, she
would flush as pink as a rose. At such moments Kolya would either
stare out of the window scowling, or would investigate the state of
his boots, or would shout angrily for <q>Perezvon,</q> the big, shaggy,
mangy dog, which he had picked up a month before, brought home,
and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not showing him to any
of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully, teaching him all
sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he
was absent at school, and when he came in, whined with delight,
rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground
pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he
had taught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the
zeal of his excited and grateful heart.
</p>

<p>
I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin
was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to
the reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending
his father when the schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the
nickname <q>wisp of tow.</q>

<head>Chapter II. Children</head>

<p>
And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November,
Kolya Krassotkin was sitting at home. It was Sunday and
there was no school. It had just struck eleven, and he particularly
wanted to go out <q>on very urgent business,</q> but he was left alone
in charge of the house, for it so happened that all its elder inmates
were absent owing to a sudden and singular event. Madame Krassotkin
had let two little rooms, separated from the rest of the house
by a passage, to a doctor's wife with her two small children. This
lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great friend of
hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve
months before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and
for the last six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it
<pb n='584'/><anchor id='Pg584'/>
not been for her friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was
some consolation to the forsaken lady, she would certainly have
completely dissolved away in tears. And now, to add to her misfortunes,
Katerina, her only servant, was suddenly moved the evening
before to announce, to her mistress's amazement, that she proposed
to bring a child into the world before morning. It seemed
almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed the probability
of it before. The astounded doctor's wife decided to move
Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town
kept by a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by
her servant, she promptly carried out this plan and remained there
looking after her. By the morning all Madame Krassotkin's friendly
sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance and appeal
to some one for help in the case.
</p>

<p>
So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins'
servant, Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus
left for a time to protect and look after <q>the kids,</q> that is, the
son and daughter of the doctor's wife, who were left alone. Kolya
was not afraid of taking care of the house, besides he had Perezvon,
who had been told to lie flat, without moving, under the bench in
the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro through the rooms,
came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two loud and
insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the whistle did
not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the luckless dog,
who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that
troubled Kolya was <q>the kids.</q> He looked, of course, with the
utmost scorn on Katerina's unexpected adventure, but he was very
fond of the bereaved <q>kiddies,</q> and had already taken them a picture-book.
Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and Kostya,
the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her. Krassotkin
could, of course, have provided more diverting entertainment for
them. He could have made them stand side by side and played
soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the house. He had
done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so much
so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses
with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side
like a trace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust,
pointing out that to play horses with boys of one's own age, boys of
<pb n='585'/><anchor id='Pg585'/>
thirteen, would certainly be disgraceful <q>at this date,</q> but that he
did it for the sake of <q>the kids</q> because he liked them, and no one
had a right to call him to account for his feelings. The two <q>kids</q>
adored him.
</p>

<p>
But on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very
important business of his own before him, something almost mysterious.
Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya, with whom he could
have left the children, would not come back from market. He
had several times already crossed the passage, opened the door of
the lodgers' room and looked anxiously at <q>the kids</q> who were sitting
over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he opened
the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would
do something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and
did not go in.
</p>

<p>
At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all,
that if that <q>damned</q> Agafya did not come back within ten minutes
he should go out without waiting for her, making <q>the kids</q>
promise, of course, to be brave when he was away, not to be naughty,
not to cry from fright. With this idea he put on his wadded
winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar, slung his satchel round
his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother's constantly reiterated
entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in such cold
weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and
went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdoor
clothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor
with his tail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine.
But Kolya, seeing his dog's passionate excitement, decided that it
was a breach of discipline, kept him for another minute under the
bench, and only when he had opened the door into the passage,
whistled for him. The dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed
bounding before him rapturously.
</p>

<p>
Kolya opened the door to peep at <q>the kids.</q> They were both
sitting as before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing
about something. The children often argued together about various
exciting problems of life, and Nastya, being the elder, always got
the best of it. If Kostya did not agree with her, he almost always
appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his verdict was regarded as
infallible by both of them. This time the <q>kids'</q> discussion rather
<pb n='586'/><anchor id='Pg586'/>
interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage to listen.
The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute with
even greater energy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall never, never believe,</q> Nastya prattled, <q>that the old
women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It's
winter now and there are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn't
have taken Katerina a daughter.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya whistled to himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to
those who are married.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nastya, how silly you are!</q> he said at last, firmly and calmly.
<q>How can Katerina have a baby when she isn't married?</q>
</p>

<p>
Nastya was exasperated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know nothing about it,</q> she snapped irritably. <q>Perhaps
she has a husband, only he is in prison, so now she's got a baby.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But is her husband in prison?</q> the matter-of-fact Kostya
inquired gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Or, I tell you what,</q> Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely
rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. <q>She hasn't a
husband, you are right there, but she wants to be married, and so
she's been thinking of getting married, and thinking and thinking
of it till now she's got it, that is, not a husband but a baby.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, perhaps so,</q> Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. <q>But
you didn't say so before. So how could I tell?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, kiddies,</q> said Kolya, stepping into the room. <q>You're
terrible people, I see.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And Perezvon with you!</q> grinned Kostya, and began snapping
his fingers and calling Perezvon.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am in a difficulty, kids,</q> Krassotkin began solemnly, <q>and
you must help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has
not turned up till now, that's certain. I must go out. Will you
let me go?</q>
</p>

<p>
The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces
showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what
was expected of them.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on
<pb n='587'/><anchor id='Pg587'/>
the cupboard and break your legs? You won't be frightened alone
and cry?</q>
</p>

<p>
A look of profound despondency came into the children's faces.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper
cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder.</q>
</p>

<p>
The children's faces instantly brightened. <q>Show us the cannon,</q>
said Kostya, beaming all over.
</p>

<p>
Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little
bronze cannon stood it on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels.</q> He rolled
the toy on along the table. <q>And it can be fired off, too. It can
be loaded with shot and fired off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And it could kill any one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It can kill any one; you've only got to aim at anybody,</q> and
Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the
shot should be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and
told them that it kicked when it was fired.
</p>

<p>
The children listened with intense interest. What particularly
struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked.
</p>

<p>
<q>And have you got any powder?</q> Nastya inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Show us the powder, too,</q> she drawled with a smile of entreaty.
</p>

<p>
Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small
flask containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in
a screw of paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little
powder into the palm of his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow
up and kill us all,</q> Krassotkin warned them sensationally.
</p>

<p>
The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that
only intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.
</p>

<p>
<q>And does the shot burn?</q> he inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it doesn't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me a little shot,</q> he asked in an imploring voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it to your
mother till I come back, or she'll be sure to think it's gunpowder,
and will die of fright and give you a thrashing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother never does whip us,</q> Nastya observed at once.
</p>

<pb n='588'/><anchor id='Pg588'/>

<p>
<q>I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don't you
ever deceive your mother except just this once, until I come back.
And so, kiddies, can I go out? You won't be frightened and cry
when I'm gone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We sha&mdash;all cry,</q> drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,</q> Nastya chimed in with
timid haste.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years!
There's no help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I
don't know how long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!</q> Kostya begged.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. <hi rend='italic'>Ici</hi>,
Perezvon.</q> And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed
all his tricks.
</p>

<p>
He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort
of lilac-gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear
was torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind
legs, lay on his back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were
dead. While this last performance was going on, the door opened
and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's servant, a stout woman of forty,
marked with small-pox, appeared in the doorway. She had come
back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand.
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to
watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return,
he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon
dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog jumped
up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only think, a dog!</q> Agafya observed sententiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you late, female?</q> asked Krassotkin sternly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brat?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you may
be sure I have good reason,</q> muttered Agafya, busying herself
about the stove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice.
She seemed quite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry
young master.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you frivolous young woman,</q> Krassotkin began, getting
up from the sofa, <q>can you swear by all you hold sacred in the
<pb n='589'/><anchor id='Pg589'/>
world and something else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over
the kids in my absence? I am going out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what am I going to swear for?</q> laughed Agafya. <q>I shall
look after them without that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, don't then. What does it matter to me? It's cold out;
stay at home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Kids,</q> Kolya turned to the children, <q>this woman will stay with
you till I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to
have been back long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You'll
give them something, Agafya, won't you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That I can do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you,
granny,</q> he added gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, <q>I
hope you'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your
old woman's nonsense about Katerina. <hi rend='italic'>Ici</hi>, Perezvon!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Get along with you!</q> retorted Agafya, really angry this time.
<q>Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things,
that's what you want!</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter III. The Schoolboy</head>

<p>
But Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he
went out at the gate he looked round him, shrugged up his
shoulders, and saying <q>It is freezing,</q> went straight along the street
and turned off to the right towards the market-place. When he
reached the last house but one before the market-place he stopped at
the gate, pulled a whistle out of his pocket, and whistled with all
his might as though giving a signal. He had not to wait more
than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven, wearing
a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This
was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya
Krassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden
by his parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known
to be a desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping
<pb n='590'/><anchor id='Pg590'/>
out on the sly. He was&mdash;if the reader has not forgotten&mdash;one of the
group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha.
He was the one who told Alyosha Karamazov about Ilusha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,</q> said
Smurov stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am late,</q> answered Krassotkin. <q>I was detained by circumstances.
You won't be thrashed for coming with me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, I say, I'm never thrashed! And you've got Perezvon with
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're taking him, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's impossible. Zhutchka's non-existent. Zhutchka is lost
in the mists of obscurity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! couldn't we do this?</q> Smurov suddenly stood still. <q>You
see Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking
dog like Perezvon. Couldn't you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he
might believe you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Boy, shun a lie, that's one thing; even with a good object&mdash;that's
another. Above all, I hope you've not told them anything about
my coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won't comfort
him with Perezvon,</q> said Smurov, with a sigh. <q>You know his
father, the captain, <q>the wisp of tow,</q> told us that he was going
to bring him a real mastiff pup, with a black nose, to-day. He
thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I doubt it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how is Ilusha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he's in consumption: he is
quite conscious, but his breathing! His breathing's gone wrong.
The other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the
room. He tried to walk, but he couldn't stand. <q>Ah, I told you
before, father,</q> he said, <q>that those boots were no good. I could
never walk properly in them.</q> He fancied it was his boots that
made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really. He won't
live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they
are rich again&mdash;they've got heaps of money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They are rogues.</q>
</p>

<pb n='591'/><anchor id='Pg591'/>

<p>
<q>Who are rogues?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of
course, individually. I don't believe in medicine. It's a useless institution.
I mean to go into all that. But what's that sentimentality
you've got up there? The whole class seems to be there every day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not the whole class: it's only ten of our fellows who go to see
him every day. There's nothing in that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What I don't understand in all this is the part that Alexey
Karamazov is taking in it. His brother's going to be tried to-morrow
or next day for such a crime, and yet he has so much time to
spend on sentimentality with boys.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now
to make it up with Ilusha.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow
no one to analyze my actions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that
you are coming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn't come all
this time?</q> Smurov cried with sudden warmth.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear boy, that's my business, not yours. I am going of myself
because I choose to, but you've all been hauled there by Alexey
Karamazov&mdash;there's a difference, you know. And how do you
know? I may not be going to make it up at all. It's a stupid
expression.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not Karamazov at all; it's not his doing. Our fellows began
going there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov
at first. And there's been nothing of that sort&mdash;no silliness. First
one went, and then another. His father was awfully pleased to see
us. You know he will simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies.
He sees that Ilusha's dying. And he seems so glad we've made it up
with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that was all. He just asks
and says no more. His father will go out of his mind or hang
himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very
decent man. We made a mistake then. It's all the fault of that
murderer who beat him then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov's a riddle to me all the same. I might have made
his acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in
some cases. Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work
out and verify.</q>
</p>

<pb n='592'/><anchor id='Pg592'/>

<p>
Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent.
Smurov, of course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of
putting himself on a level with him. Now he was tremendously interested
at Kolya's saying that he was <q>going of himself</q> to see
Ilusha. He felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya's suddenly
taking it into his head to go to him that day. They crossed
the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded wagons
from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market
women were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths.
These Sunday markets were naïvely called <q>fairs</q> in the town, and
there were many such fairs in the year.
</p>

<p>
Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one
side, then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt
each other over according to the rules of canine etiquette.
</p>

<p>
<q>I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,</q> said Kolya suddenly.
<q>Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they
meet? It seems to be a law of their nature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; it's a funny habit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not funny; you are wrong there. There's nothing funny
in nature, however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices.
If dogs could reason and criticize us they'd be sure to find just as
much that would be funny to them, if not far more, in the social
relations of men, their masters&mdash;far more, indeed. I repeat that,
because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us.
That's Rakitin's idea&mdash;a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist, Smurov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what is a Socialist?</q> asked Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's when all are equal and all have property in common,
there are no marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he
likes best, and all the rest of it. You are not old enough to understand
that yet. It's cold, though.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer
just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we
don't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of
frost as we do now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden
frost of twelve degrees, especially when there is not much snow.
It's because people are not used to it. Everything is habit with men,
<pb n='593'/><anchor id='Pg593'/>
everything even in their social and political relations. Habit is the
great motive-power. What a funny-looking peasant!</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance
in a long sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping
together his hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them.
His long fair beard was all white with frost.
</p>

<p>
<q>That peasant's beard's frozen,</q> Kolya cried in a loud provocative
voice as he passed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lots of people's beards are frozen,</q> the peasant replied, calmly
and sententiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't provoke him,</q> observed Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all right; he won't be cross; he's a nice fellow. Good-by,
Matvey.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is your name Matvey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Didn't you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't. It was a guess.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You get whipped, I expect?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing to speak of&mdash;sometimes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Does it hurt?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, yes, it does.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ech, what a life!</q> The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom
of his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Matvey.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys went on.
</p>

<p>
<q>That was a nice peasant,</q> Kolya observed to Smurov. <q>I like
talking to the peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?</q> asked
Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>I had to say that to please him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know, Smurov, I don't like being asked the same thing twice.
I like people to understand at the first word. Some things can't be
explained. According to a peasant's notions, schoolboys are whipped,
and must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not
<pb n='594'/><anchor id='Pg594'/>
whipped? And if I were to tell him we are not, he'd be disappointed.
But you don't understand that. One has to know how
to talk to the peasants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only don't tease them, please, or you'll get into another scrape
as you did about that goose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you're afraid?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't laugh, Kolya. Of course I'm afraid. My father would be
awfully cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!</q>
he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths.
</p>

<p>
<q>Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,</q> the middle-aged
market woman shouted at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so glad it's Marya. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm in a hurry. I can't stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.</q>
Kolya waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked
him and not he her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you
impudent young monkey. I didn't say anything,</q> bawled Marya.
<q>You want a whipping, that's what you want, you saucy jackanapes!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a roar of laughter among the other market women
round her. Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the
arcade of shops close by. He was a young man, not a native of
the town, with dark, curly hair and a long, pale face, marked with
smallpox. He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap, and looked
like a merchant's clerk. He was in a state of stupid excitement and
brandished his fist at Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you!</q> he cried angrily, <q>I know you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have
had a row with the man. But he had been in so many rows in the
street that he could hardly remember them all.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you?</q> he asked sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you! I know you!</q> the man repeated idiotically.
</p>

<p>
<q>So much the better for you. Well, it's time I was going.
Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are at your saucy pranks again?</q> cried the man. <q>You are
at your saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!</q>
</p>

<pb n='595'/><anchor id='Pg595'/>

<p>
<q>It's not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks
again,</q> said Kolya, standing still and scanning him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not my business?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; it's not your business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's Trifon Nikititch's business, not yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What Trifon Nikititch?</q> asked the youth, staring with loutish
amazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.
</p>

<p>
Kolya scanned him gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?</q> he suddenly
asked him, with stern emphasis.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven't,</q> said
the young man, somewhat taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know Sabaneyev?</q> Kolya went on even more emphatically
and even more severely.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Sabaneyev? No, I don't know him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well then you can go to the devil,</q> said Kolya, cutting short the
conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on
his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who
did not even know Sabaneyev.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?</q> the young man recovered from
his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before. <q>What
did he say?</q> He turned to the market women with a silly stare.
</p>

<p>
The women laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can never tell what he's after,</q> said one of them.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Sabaneyev is it he's talking about?</q> the young man repeated,
still furious and brandishing his right arm.
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that's
who it must be,</q> one of the women suggested.
</p>

<p>
The young man stared at her wildly.
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Kuzmitchovs?</q> repeated another woman. <q>But his
name wasn't Trifon. His name's Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy
said Trifon Nikititch, so it can't be the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it's Tchizhov,</q> put
in suddenly a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening
gravely. <q>Alexey Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.</q>
</p>

<pb n='596'/><anchor id='Pg596'/>

<p>
<q>Not a doubt about it, it's Tchizhov,</q> a fourth woman emphatically
confirmed the statement.
</p>

<p>
The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.
</p>

<p>
<q>But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?</q>
he cried almost in desperation. <q><q>Do you know Sabaneyev?</q> says
he. And who the devil's to know who is Sabaneyev?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a senseless fellow. I tell you it's not Sabaneyev, but
Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that's who it is!</q> one of the
women shouted at him impressively.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the
summer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I tell what he's to do with you?</q> put in another. <q>You
ought to know yourself what you want with him, if you make such
a clamor about him. He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you
stupid. Don't you really know him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Know whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tchizhov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I'll give him a hiding,
that I will. He was laughing at me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one.
You are a fool, that's what you are!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman.
I'll give the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing
at me!</q>
</p>

<p>
The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off,
marching along with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him,
looking round at the shouting group far behind. He too was in
high spirits, though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape
in Kolya's company.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Sabaneyev did you mean?</q> he asked Kolya, foreseeing
what his answer would be.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do I know? Now there'll be a hubbub among them all
day. I like to stir up fools in every class of society. There's another
blockhead, that peasant there. You know, they say <q>there's no one
stupider than a stupid Frenchman,</q> but a stupid Russian shows it in
<pb n='597'/><anchor id='Pg597'/>
his face just as much. Can't you see it all over his face that he is a
fool, that peasant, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him alone, Kolya. Let's go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning,
peasant!</q>
</p>

<p>
A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled
beard, who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy.
He seemed not quite sober.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,</q> he said deliberately
in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>And if I am?</q> laughed Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, a joke's a joke. Laugh away. I don't mind. There's no
harm in a joke.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, God forgive you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you forgive me, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I quite forgive you. Go along.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say, you seem a clever peasant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cleverer than you,</q> the peasant answered unexpectedly, with
the same gravity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I doubt it,</q> said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's true, though.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is, brother.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, peasant!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by!</q>
</p>
