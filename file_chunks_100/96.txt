very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move his
tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout
the interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining
of headache and of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate
<pb n='684'/><anchor id='Pg684'/>
face seemed to have become so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his
crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye,
which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something,
Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. <q>It's always worth while
speaking to a clever man.</q> Ivan was reminded of that at once.
He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful
effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to speak.
He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you talk to me?</q> asked Ivan. <q>I won't tire you much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I can,</q> mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. <q>Has
your honor been back long?</q> he added patronizingly, as though
encouraging a nervous visitor.
</p>

<p>
<q>I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.</q>
Smerdyakov sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,</q> Ivan blurted out.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how
could I tell it would turn out like that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What would turn out? Don't prevaricate! You've foretold
you'd have a fit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You
mentioned the very spot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you said so at the examination yet?</q> Smerdyakov queried
with composure.
</p>

<p>
Ivan felt suddenly angry.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a
great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let
you play with me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you,
as in God Almighty?</q> said Smerdyakov, with the same composure,
only for a moment closing his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the first place,</q> began Ivan, <q>I know that epileptic fits can't
be told beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in.
You can't foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me
the day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How
could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit,
if you didn't sham a fit on purpose?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,</q>
Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. <q>I fell from the garret just in
<pb n='685'/><anchor id='Pg685'/>
the same way a year ago. It's quite true you can't tell the day and
hour of a fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment
of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you did foretell the day and the hour!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the
doctors here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham;
it's no use my saying any more about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the
cellar?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going
down to the cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened
me most was losing you and being left without defense in all
the world. So I went down into the cellar thinking, <q>Here, it'll
come on directly, it'll strike me down directly, shall I fall?</q> And
it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always
comes ... and so I went flying. All that and all my previous
conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when I told
you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that
to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating
lawyer, and it's all been written down in the protocol. And the
doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was
just the thought of it brought it on, the apprehension that I might
fall. It was just then that the fit seized me. And so they've written
it down, that it's just how it must have happened, simply from
my fear.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you have said all that in your evidence?</q> said Ivan, somewhat
taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat
of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov
had already reported it all himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole
truth,</q> Smerdyakov pronounced firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And have you told them every word of our conversation at the
gate?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not to say every word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted
then?</q>
</p>

<pb n='686'/><anchor id='Pg686'/>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't tell them that either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was afraid you'd go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer,
anyway.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told
me to get out of the way of trouble.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,
foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to
spare myself even more. That's why I told you to get out of
harm's way, that you might understand that there would be trouble
in the house, and would remain at home to protect your father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!</q> Ivan
suddenly fired up.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my
fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I
might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would
make a scene and carry away that money, for he considered it as
good as his own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder
like this? I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand
that lay under the master's mattress in the envelope, and you
see, he's murdered him. How could you guess it either, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could
I have guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!</q>
said Ivan, pondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya
and not to Moscow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I guess it from that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for
a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to
go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you
nearer, for Moscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
knowing you are not far off, would not be so bold. And if anything
had happened, you might have come to protect me, too, for
I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch's illness, and that I was
afraid of having a fit. And when I explained those knocks to you,
by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that Dmitri
Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would
<pb n='687'/><anchor id='Pg687'/>
guess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so
wouldn't go to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He talks very coherently,</q> thought Ivan, <q>though he does mumble;
what's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube
talked of?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are cunning with me, damn you!</q> he exclaimed, getting
angry.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,</q> Smerdyakov
parried with the simplest air.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I'd guessed, I should have stayed,</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went
away in such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away
and save yourself in your fright.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, I thought you were like me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I ought to have guessed,</q> Ivan said in agitation; <q>and
I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only
you are lying, you are lying again,</q> he cried, suddenly recollecting.
<q>Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me,
<q>It's always worth while speaking to a clever man</q>? So you were
glad I went away, since you praised me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into
his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I was pleased,</q> he articulated rather breathlessly, <q>it was
simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya.
For it was nearer, anyway. Only when I said these
words to you, it was not by way of praise, but of reproach. You
didn't understand it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What reproach?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own
father, and would not protect us, for I might have been taken up
any time for stealing that three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn you!</q> Ivan swore again. <q>Stay, did you tell the prosecutor
and the investigating lawyer about those knocks?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I told them everything just as it was.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan wondered inwardly again.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I thought of anything then,</q> he began again, <q>it was solely
of some wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that
he would steal&mdash;I did not believe that then.... But I was prepared
<pb n='688'/><anchor id='Pg688'/>
for any wickedness from you. You told me yourself you
could sham a fit. What did you say that for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a
fit on purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you.
It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted
with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What else is left for him to do?</q> said Smerdyakov, with a bitter
grin. <q>And who will believe him with all the proofs against him?
Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after
that? But never mind him! He is trembling to save himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection,
added:
</p>

<p>
<q>And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make
out that it is the work of my hands&mdash;I've heard that already. But
as to my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand
that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design
against your father? If I had been planning such a murder could
I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself
beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely?
As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one
hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you
were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you
might defend me completely by doing so, for who would be likely
to be such a criminal, if he is so open-hearted beforehand? Any
one can see that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck
by Smerdyakov's last argument. <q>I don't suspect you at all, and I
think it's absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am
grateful to you for setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but
I'll come again. Meanwhile, good-by. Get well. Is there anything
you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not
forget me, and provides me anything I want, according to her kindness.
Good people visit me every day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by. But I shan't say anything of your being able to
sham a fit, and I don't advise you to, either,</q> something made Ivan
say suddenly.
</p>

<pb n='689'/><anchor id='Pg689'/>

<p>
<q>I quite understand. And if you don't speak of that, I shall say
nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had
gone a dozen steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there
was an insulting significance in Smerdyakov's last words. He was
almost on the point of turning back, but it was only a passing
impulse, and muttering, <q>Nonsense!</q> he went out of the hospital.
</p>

<p>
His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not
Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though
he might have been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want
to analyze the reason for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance
at prying into his sensations. He felt as though he wanted
to make haste to forget something. In the following days he became
convinced of Mitya's guilt, as he got to know all the weight
of evidence against him. There was evidence of people of no importance,
Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it
was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern,
and at Plotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their
evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning.
The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as
much as Grigory's evidence as to the open door. Grigory's wife,
Marfa, in answer to Ivan's questions, declared that Smerdyakov
had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. <q>He
was not three paces from our bed,</q> and that although she was a
sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, <q>He
was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.</q>
</p>

<p>
Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov
was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from
the old man a subtle smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know how he spends his time now?</q> he asked; <q>learning
lists of French words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his
pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him
by some one, he he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of
Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however.
Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that <q>in all
probability</q> Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha's
opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it
<pb n='690'/><anchor id='Pg690'/>
now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not
make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never
began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too,
struck Ivan particularly.
</p>

<p>
But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something
quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned
himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina
Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion
of Ivan's, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would
furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never
write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving
Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I've related already, told
him, <q>I am not keen on her,</q> it was an absolute lie: he loved her
madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered
her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered
by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan's return
to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated
in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who
had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well),
and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own.
But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to
the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions
and the great fascination he had for her. She was continually
tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted Mitya,
and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they were numerous)
she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to
Alyosha <q>lies upon lies.</q> There was, of course, much that was false
in it, and that angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all
this later.
</p>

<p>
He did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov's existence,
and yet, a fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be
haunted by the same strange thoughts as before. It's enough to say
that he was continually asking himself, why was it that on that
last night in Fyodor Pavlovitch's house he had crept out on to the
stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his father was doing
below? Why had he recalled that afterwards with repulsion? Why
next morning, had he been suddenly so depressed on the journey?
Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to himself, <q>I am a scoundrel</q>?
<pb n='691'/><anchor id='Pg691'/>
And now he almost fancied that these tormenting thoughts
would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so completely did
they take possession of him again. It was just after fancying this,
that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once, and put
a question to him:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat
father, and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved <q>the
right to desire</q>?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired
father's death or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did think so,</q> answered Alyosha, softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn't you
fancy then that what I wished was just that <q>one reptile should
devour another</q>; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as
soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help
to bring that about?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother's
face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak!</q> cried Ivan, <q>I want above everything to know what
you thought then. I want the truth, the truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his
answer came.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,</q> whispered
Alyosha, and he did not add one softening phrase.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks,</q> snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly
on his way. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously
to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to
him, so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately
after that meeting with him, Ivan had not gone home, but
went straight to Smerdyakov again.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital.
Ivan knew his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house,
divided in two by a passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna
<pb n='692'/><anchor id='Pg692'/>
and her mother, and on the other, Smerdyakov. No one
knew on what terms he lived with them, whether as a friend or as
a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with
them as Marya Kondratyevna's betrothed, and was living there for
a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and
daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as
greatly superior to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into
the passage. By Marya Kondratyevna's directions he went straight
to the better room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was
a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot. The walls were
gay with blue paper, which was a good deal used however, and in
the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers, so
that there was a continual rustling from them. The furniture was
very scanty: two benches against each wall and two chairs by the
table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink
patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two
little windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the
table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a
tray with two cups. But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the
samovar was out. He was sitting at the table on a bench. He was
looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen. There
was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick, but with a
composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov's face that he
had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,
fuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down
at the sides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown,
rather dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his
nose, which Ivan had never seen him wearing before. This trifling
circumstance suddenly redoubled Ivan's anger: <q>A creature like that
and wearing spectacles!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his
visitor through his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and
rose from the bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily,
doing the least possible required by common civility. All this struck
Ivan instantly; he took it all in and noted it at once&mdash;most of all
the look in Smerdyakov's eyes, positively malicious, churlish and
haughty. <q>What do you want to intrude for?</q> it seemed to say;
<pb n='693'/><anchor id='Pg693'/>
<q>we settled everything then; why have you come again?</q> Ivan
could scarcely control himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's hot here,</q> he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take off your coat,</q> Smerdyakov conceded.
</p>

<p>
Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling
hands. He took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down.
Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>To begin with, are we alone?</q> Ivan asked sternly and impulsively.
<q>Can they overhear us in there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a
passage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was
leaving the hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of
shamming fits, you wouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our
conversation at the gate? What do you mean by <emph>all</emph>? What could
you mean by it? Were you threatening me? Have I entered into
some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am afraid of
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with
obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and
meant to show his cards. Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully,
his left eye winked, and he at once gave his answer, with his habitual
composure and deliberation. <q>You want to have everything above-board;
very well, you shall have it,</q> he seemed to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you,
knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him
to his fate, and that people mightn't after that conclude any evil
about your feelings and perhaps of something else, too&mdash;that's what
I promised not to tell the authorities.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling
himself, yet there was something in his voice, determined and
emphatic, resentful and insolently defiant. He stared impudently
at Ivan. A mist passed before Ivan's eyes for the first moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>How? What? Are you out of your mind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you suppose I <emph>knew</emph> of the murder?</q> Ivan cried at last, and
<pb n='694'/><anchor id='Pg694'/>
he brought his fist violently on the table. <q>What do you mean by
<q>something else, too</q>? Speak, scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent
stare.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that <q>something else, too</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The <q>something else</q> I meant was that you probably, too, were
very desirous of your parent's death.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder,
so that he fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was
bathed in tears. Saying, <q>It's a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,</q>
he dried his eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank
into quiet weeping. A minute passed.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough! Leave off,</q> Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down
again. <q>Don't put me out of all patience.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered
face reflected the insult he had just received.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri
I meant to kill my father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I didn't know what thoughts were in your mind then,</q> said
Smerdyakov resentfully; <q>and so I stopped you then at the gate to
sound you on that very point.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To sound what, what?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father
to be murdered or not.</q>
</p>

<p>
What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive,
insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was you murdered him?</q> he cried suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't I murdered him.
And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible
man to speak of it again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in
such a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I
resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same
as your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I
should be crushed like a fly, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago.</q>
</p>

<pb n='695'/><anchor id='Pg695'/>

<p>
<q>I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I
thought you'd understand without wasting words, and that being
such a sensible man you wouldn't care to talk of it openly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ...
what could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your
mean soul?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't
want to, but as for wanting some one else to do it, that was just
what you did want.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have
wanted it; what grounds had I for wanting it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?</q> said
Smerdyakov sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. <q>Why,
after your parent's death there was at least forty thousand to come
to each of you, and very likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got
married then to that lady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have
had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding, for
she's plenty of sense, so that your parent would not have left you
two roubles between the three of you. And were they far from a
wedding, either? Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only to lift
her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with
his tongue out.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very good,</q> he commented at last. <q>You see, I haven't jumped
up, I haven't knocked you down, I haven't killed you. Speak on.
So, according to you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning
on him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then
he would lose all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property,
and would go off to exile; so his share of the inheritance would come
to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so
you'd each have not forty, but sixty thousand each. There's not a
doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had
reckoned on any one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri,
and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you ... at the
time.... I remember my impression!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning
<pb n='696'/><anchor id='Pg696'/>
on me as well,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. <q>So that
it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was
in your mind. For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went
away, you as good as said to me, <q>You can murder my parent, I
won't hinder you!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You scoundrel! So that's how you understood it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were
meaning to go to Moscow and refused all your father's entreaties to
go to Tchermashnya&mdash;and simply at a foolish word from me you
consented at once! What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya?
Since you went to Tchermashnya with no reason, simply
at my word, it shows that you must have expected something
from me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I swear I didn't!</q> shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.
</p>

<p>
<q>You didn't? Then you ought, as your father's son, to have had
me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ...
or at least, to have given me a punch in the face on the spot,
but you were not a bit angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly
way acted on my foolish word and went away, which was utterly
absurd, for you ought to have stayed to save your parent's life. How
could I help drawing my conclusions?</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am sorry I didn't punch you in the face,</q> he said with a
bitter smile. <q>I couldn't have taken you to the lock-up just then.
Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against
you? But the punch in the face ... oh, I'm sorry I didn't think
of it. Though blows are forbidden, I should have pounded your
ugly face to a jelly.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the ordinary occasions of life,</q> he said in the same complacent
and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued
with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch's table, <q>in the ordinary
occasions of life, blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by
law, and people have given them up, but in exceptional occasions
of life people still fly to blows, not only among us but all over the
world, be it even the fullest Republic of France, just as in the time
of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave off, but you, even in an
exceptional case, did not dare.</q>
</p>

<pb n='697'/><anchor id='Pg697'/>

<p>
<q>What are you learning French words for?</q> Ivan nodded towards
the exercise-book lying on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why shouldn't I learn them so as to improve my education,
supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy
parts of Europe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, monster.</q> Ivan's eyes flashed and he trembled all over.
<q>I am not afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like
about me, and if I don't beat you to death, it's simply because I
suspect you of that crime and I'll drag you to justice. I'll unmask
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To my thinking, you'd better keep quiet, for what can you
accuse me of, considering my absolute innocence? and who would
believe you? Only if you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I
must defend myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think I am afraid of you now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If the court doesn't believe all I've said to you just now, the
public will, and you will be ashamed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's as much as to say, <q>It's always worth while speaking to a
sensible man,</q> eh?</q> snarled Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You hit the mark, indeed. And you'd better be sensible.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat,
and without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking
at him, walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air
refreshed him. There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare
of ideas and sensations filled his soul. <q>Shall I go at once and give
information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give?
He is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he'll accuse me. And
in fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then? What for?
What for?</q> Ivan asked himself. <q>Yes, of course, I was expecting
something and he is right....</q> And he remembered for the hundredth
time how, on the last night in his father's house, he had
listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish
that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. <q>Yes,
I expected it then, that's true! I wanted the murder, I did want
the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must
kill Smerdyakov! If I don't dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not
worth living!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna
<pb n='698'/><anchor id='Pg698'/>
and alarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He
repeated all his conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it.
He couldn't be calmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he
kept walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly.
At last he sat down, put his elbows on the table, leaned his head on
his hands and pronounced this strange sentence: <q>If it's not Dmitri,
but Smerdyakov who's the murderer, I share his guilt, for I put him
up to it. Whether I did, I don't know yet. But if he is the murderer,
and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat
without a word, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing
on it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was
the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a <q>conclusive
proof</q> that Dmitri had killed his father. It was the letter
written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the
very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the
monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna's, when Grushenka
had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed
to Grushenka. I don't know whether he saw her, but in the evening
he was at the <q>Metropolis,</q> where he got thoroughly drunk. Then
he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences
to himself. It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a
drunken letter in fact. It was like the talk of a drunken man, who,
on his return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife
or one of his household how he has just been insulted, what a rascal
had just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the other hand,
and how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length,
with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows
on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary
paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern and
there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently
not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only
filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.
The letter ran as follows:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Fatal Katya</hi>: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your
three thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell,
too, my love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get
it from every one, and if I can't borrow it, I give you my word of
<pb n='699'/><anchor id='Pg699'/>
honor I shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money
from under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to
Siberia for it, I'll give you back your three thousand. And farewell.
I bow down to the ground before you, for I've been a scoundrel to
you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you'll be happier
and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love another
woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can you
forgive? I will murder the man who's robbed me! I'll leave you all
and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not <emph>her</emph> either, for you
are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!
</p>

<p>
P.S.&mdash;I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart.
One string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two!
I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three thousand
from him and fling it to you. Though I've been a scoundrel
to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand. The cur
keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a thief, but
I'll murder my thief. Katya, don't look disdainful. Dmitri is not a
thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father and ruined himself
to hold his ground, rather than endure your pride. And he
doesn't love you.
</p>

<p>
P.P.S.&mdash;I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.&mdash;Katya, pray to God
that some one'll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in
gore, and if no one does&mdash;I shall! Kill me!
</p>

Your slave and enemy,

<p>
When Ivan read this <q>document</q> he was convinced. So then it
was his brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then
not he, Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of
a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of
Mitya's guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way,
that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with
Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts.
Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only thought
of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later he
positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed
at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and
forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about
Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and
out of his mind.
</p>

<pb n='700'/><anchor id='Pg700'/>

<p>
<q>He'll end in madness,</q> the young doctor Varvinsky observed
about him, and Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that
month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the
Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just
before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina
Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in
love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna's <q>returns</q> to Mitya,
that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor, drove
Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene described
above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan
had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of
Mitya's guilt, in spite of those <q>returns</q> that were so hateful to him.
It is remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more
and more every day, he realized that it was not on account of
Katya's <q>returns</q> that he hated him, but just <emph>because he was the
murderer of his father</emph>. He was conscious of this and fully recognized
it to himself.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and
proposed to him a plan of escape&mdash;a plan he had obviously thought
over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place
still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov's, that it was to
his, Ivan's, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as that
would increase his inheritance and Alyosha's from forty to sixty
thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on
arranging Mitya's escape. On his return from seeing him, he was
very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was
anxious for Mitya's escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing
thirty thousand, but for another reason. <q>Is it because I am
as much a murderer at heart?</q> he asked himself. Something very
deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above
all suffered cruelly all that month. But of that later....
</p>

<p>
When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided
with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he
obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly
remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him
in Alyosha's presence: <q>It was you, you, persuaded me of his</q>
(that is, Mitya's) <q>guilt!</q> Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled
it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was
<pb n='701'/><anchor id='Pg701'/>
the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her
presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was
<emph>she</emph>, she, who had produced that <q>document</q> and proved his
brother's guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: <q>I've been at
Smerdyakov's myself!</q> When had she been there? Ivan had known
nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya's guilt! And
what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said
to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could not understand
how he could, half an hour before, have let those words pass
and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and
rushed off to Smerdyakov. <q>I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,</q>
he thought on the way.

<head>Chapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
When he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been
blowing early that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow
began falling thickly. It did not lie on the ground, but was
whirled about by the wind, and soon there was a regular snowstorm.
There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of the town where
Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness, unconscious
of the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His head ached
and there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that his
hands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevna's
cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken
little peasant. He was wearing a coarse and patched coat, and was
walking in zigzags, grumbling and swearing to himself. Then
suddenly he would begin singing in a husky drunken voice:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>I won't wait till he comes back.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing
again; then he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an
intense hatred for him before he had thought about him at all.
Suddenly he realized his presence and felt an irresistible impulse to
<pb n='702'/><anchor id='Pg702'/>
knock him down. At that moment they met, and the peasant with
a violent lurch fell full tilt against Ivan, who pushed him back
furiously. The peasant went flying backwards and fell like a log
on the frozen ground. He uttered one plaintive <q>O&mdash;oh!</q> and then
was silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He was lying on his back,
without movement or consciousness. <q>He will be frozen,</q> thought
Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakov's.
</p>

<p>
In the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the
door with a candle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was
very ill, <q>It's not that he's laid up, but he seems not himself, and
he even told us to take the tea away; he wouldn't have any.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, does he make a row?</q> asked Ivan coarsely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he's very quiet. Only please
don't talk to him too long,</q> Marya Kondratyevna begged him.
Ivan opened the door and stepped into the room.
</p>

<p>
It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room.
One of the benches at the side had been removed, and in its place
had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed
had been made up, with fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov
was sitting on the sofa, wearing the same dressing-gown. The table
had been brought out in front of the sofa, so that there was hardly
room to move. On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover, but
Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be sitting doing nothing.
He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was apparently not
at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in his
face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and
there were blue marks under them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you really are ill?</q> Ivan stopped short. <q>I won't keep
you long, I won't even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?</q>
</p>

<p>
He went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and
sat down on it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you look at me without speaking? I've only come with
one question, and I swear I won't go without an answer. Has the
young lady, Katerina Ivanovna, been with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.
Suddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with you?</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing.</q>
</p>

<pb n='703'/><anchor id='Pg703'/>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>nothing</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, she has. It's no matter to you. Let me alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I won't let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I'd quite forgotten about her,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a
scornful smile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him
with a look of frenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on
him at their last interview, a month before.
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don't look
like yourself,</q> he said to Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow.
Are you so worried?</q> He smiled contemptuously and suddenly
laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen; I've told you I won't go away without an answer!</q> Ivan
cried, intensely irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?</q>
said Smerdyakov, with a look of suffering.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn it! I've nothing to do with you. Just answer my question
and I'll go away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've no answer to give you,</q> said Smerdyakov, looking down
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You may be sure I'll make you answer!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you so uneasy?</q> Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply
with contempt, but almost with repulsion. <q>Is this because the trial
begins to-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can't you believe
that at last? Go home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don't be afraid
of anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?</q>
Ivan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill
breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured
him with his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't understand?</q> he drawled reproachfully. <q>It's a
strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious
tone of this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary
in itself. He had not taken such a tone even at their last
interview.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you, you've nothing to be afraid of. I won't say anything
<pb n='704'/><anchor id='Pg704'/>
about you; there's no proof against you. I say, how your hands are
trembling! Why are your fingers moving like that? Go home, <emph>you</emph>
did not murder him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan started. He remembered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it was not I,</q> he faltered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you?</q> Smerdyakov caught him up again.
</p>

<p>
Ivan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes
on Ivan with insane hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, it was you who murdered him, if that's it,</q> he whispered
furiously.
</p>

<p>
Ivan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something.
He laughed malignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you
understand it now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All I understand is that you are mad.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what's the
use of going on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still
trying to throw it all on me, to my face? <emph>You</emph> murdered him; you
are the real murderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful
servant, and it was following your words I did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>Did</emph> it? Why, did you murder him?</q> Ivan turned cold.
</p>

<p>
Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all
over with a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him
wonderingly; probably the genuineness of Ivan's horror struck him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't mean to say you really did not know?</q> he faltered
mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still
gazed at him, and seemed unable to speak.
</p>

<l>Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;</l>
<l>I won't wait till he comes back,</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
suddenly echoed in his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom
sitting before me,</q> he muttered.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No
doubt he is here, that third, between us.</q>
</p>

<pb n='705'/><anchor id='Pg705'/>

<p>
<q>Who is he? Who is here? What third person?</q> Ivan cried in
alarm, looking about him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.
</p>

<p>
<q>That third is God Himself&mdash;Providence. He is the third beside
us now. Only don't look for Him, you won't find Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a lie that you killed him!</q> Ivan cried madly. <q>You are
mad, or teasing me again!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of
fear. He could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied
that Ivan knew everything and was trying to <q>throw it all on him
to his face.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a minute,</q> he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly
bringing up his left leg from under the table, he began turning up
his trouser leg. He was wearing long white stockings and slippers.
Slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his
stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm
of terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's mad!</q> he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back,
so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against
it, stiff and straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov,
who, entirely unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his
stocking, as though he were making an effort to get hold of something
with his fingers and pull it out. At last he got hold of it and
began pulling it out. Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper, or
perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on
the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here,</q> he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q> asked Ivan, trembling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Kindly look at it,</q> Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low
tone.
</p>

<p>
Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began
unfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though from
contact with a loathsome reptile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your hands keep twitching,</q> observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberately
unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were
three packets of hundred-rouble notes.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not
count them. Take them,</q> Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding
<pb n='706'/><anchor id='Pg706'/>
at the notes. Ivan sank back in his chair. He was as white as a
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
<q>You frightened me ... with your stocking,</q> he said, with a
strange grin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you really not have known till now?</q> Smerdyakov asked
once more.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother,
brother! Ach!</q> He suddenly clutched his head in both hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother's help or
without?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri
Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on
trembling? I can't speak properly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You were bold enough then. You said <q>everything was lawful,</q>
and how frightened you are now,</q> Smerdyakov muttered in surprise.
<q>Won't you have some lemonade? I'll ask for some at once. It's
very refreshing. Only I must hide this first.</q>
</p>

<p>
And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get
up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade
and bring it them, but, looking for something to cover up the
notes that she might not see them, he first took out his handkerchief,
and as it turned out to be very dirty, took up the big yellow book
that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table, and put it over the
notes. The book was <hi rend='italic'>The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the
Syrian</hi>. Ivan read it mechanically.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have any lemonade,</q> he said. <q>Talk of me later. Sit
down and tell me how you did it. Tell me all about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better take off your greatcoat, or you'll be too hot.</q>
Ivan, as though he'd only just thought of it, took off his coat, and,
without getting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak, please, speak.</q>
</p>

<p>
He seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov
would tell him <emph>all</emph> about it.
</p>

<p>
<q>How it was done?</q> sighed Smerdyakov. <q>It was done in a most
natural way, following your very words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of my words later,</q> Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete
self-possession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting
<pb n='707'/><anchor id='Pg707'/>
as before. <q>Only tell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as
it happened. Don't forget anything. The details, above everything,
the details, I beg you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd gone away, then I fell into the cellar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a fit or in a sham one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down
the steps to the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay
down I gave a scream, and struggled, till they carried me out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in
the hospital?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took
me to the hospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than
I've had for years. For two days I was quite unconscious.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right. Go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They laid me on the bed. I knew I'd be the other side of the
partition, for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me
there, near them. She's always been very kind to me, from my birth
up. At night I moaned, but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri
Fyodorovitch to come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Expecting him? To come to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I'd no
doubt that he'd come that night, for being without me and getting
no news, he'd be sure to come and climb over the fence, as he used
to, and do something.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And if he hadn't come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then nothing would have happened. I should never have
brought myself to it without him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don't hurry;
above all, don't leave anything out!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was
certain, for I had prepared him for it ... during the last few
days.... He knew about the knocks, that was the chief thing.
With his suspiciousness and the fury which had been growing in
him all those days, he was bound to get into the house by means of
those taps. That was inevitable, so I was expecting him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> Ivan interrupted; <q>if he had killed him, he would have
taken the money and carried it away; you must have considered that.
What would you have got by it afterwards? I don't see.</q>
</p>

<pb n='708'/><anchor id='Pg708'/>

<p>
<q>But he would never have found the money. That was only
what I told him, that the money was under the mattress. But that
wasn't true. It had been lying in a box. And afterwards I suggested
to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I was the only person he trusted,
to hide the envelope with the notes in the corner behind the ikons,
for no one would have guessed that place, especially if they came in
a hurry. So that's where the envelope lay, in the corner behind the
ikons. It would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress;
the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was under the
mattress. A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had committed the murder, finding nothing, he would either have
run away in a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with
murderers, or he would have been arrested. So I could always have
clambered up to the ikons and have taken away the money next
morning or even that night, and it would have all been put down to
Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon upon that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured
to take the money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated
that he would beat him senseless, and I should have time to
take it then, and then I'd make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it
was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch who had taken the money
after beating him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all
who killed him; you only took the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, he didn't kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now
that he was the murderer.... But I don't want to lie to you now,
because ... because if you really haven't understood till now, as
I see for myself, and are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt
on me to my very face, you are still responsible for it all, since you
knew of the murder and charged me to do it, and went away knowing
all about it. And so I want to prove to your face this evening
that you are the only real murderer in the whole affair, and I am
not the real murderer, though I did kill him. You are the rightful
murderer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!</q> Ivan cried, unable to
restrain himself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing
himself till the end of the conversation. <q>You still mean that
<pb n='709'/><anchor id='Pg709'/>
Tchermashnya? Stay, tell me, why did you want my consent, if you
really took Tchermashnya for consent? How will you explain that
now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn't
have made an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if
I'd been suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice;
on the contrary, you would have protected me from
others.... And when you got your inheritance you would have
rewarded me when you were able, all the rest of your life. For
you'd have received your inheritance through me, seeing that if he
had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn't have had a
farthing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,</q>
snarled Ivan. <q>And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had informed
against you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to
Tchermashnya? That's all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation
you would either have gone away or have stayed. If you had
stayed, nothing would have happened. I should have known that
you didn't want it done, and should have attempted nothing. As
you went away, it meant you assured me that you wouldn't dare to
inform against me at the trial, and that you'd overlook my having
the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn't have prosecuted
me afterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court;
that is, not that I had stolen the money or killed him&mdash;I shouldn't
have said that&mdash;but that you'd put me up to the theft and the
murder, though I didn't consent to it. That's why I needed your
consent, so that you couldn't have cornered me afterwards, for what
proof could you have had? I could always have cornered you, revealing
your eagerness for your father's death, and I tell you the
public would have believed it all, and you would have been ashamed
for the rest of your life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Was I then so eager, was I?</q> Ivan snarled again.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned
my doing it.</q> Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He
was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner
force urged him on. He evidently had some design. Ivan felt that.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go on,</q> he said. <q>Tell me what happened that night.</q>
</p>

<pb n='710'/><anchor id='Pg710'/>

<p>
<q>What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard
the master shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly
got up and came out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then
all was silence and darkness. I lay there waiting, my heart beating;
I couldn't bear it. I got up at last, went out. I saw the window
open on the left into the garden, and I stepped to the left to listen
whether he was sitting there alive, and I heard the master moving
about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. <q>Ech!</q> I thought. I went
to the window and shouted to the master, <q>It's I.</q> And he shouted
to me, <q>He's been, he's been; he's run away.</q> He meant Dmitri
Fyodorovitch had been. <q>He's killed Grigory!</q> <q>Where?</q> I whispered.
<q>There, in the corner,</q> he pointed. He was whispering, too.
<q>Wait a bit,</q> I said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and
there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered
with blood, senseless. So it's true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been
here, was the thought that came into my head, and I determined on
the spot to make an end of it, as Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he
were alive, would see nothing of it, as he lay there senseless. The
only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up. I felt that at
the moment, but the longing to get it done came over me, till I could
scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the master and said,
<q>She's here, she's come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants to
be let in.</q> And he started like a baby. <q>Where is she?</q> he fairly
gasped, but couldn't believe it. <q>She's standing there,</q> said I.
<q>Open.</q> He looked out of the window at me, half believing and
half distrustful, but afraid to open. <q>Why, he is afraid of me now,</q>
I thought. And it was funny. I bethought me to knock on the
window-frame those taps we'd agreed upon as a signal that
Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his eyes. He didn't
seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps, he ran
at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, but
he stood in the way to prevent me passing. <q>Where is she? Where
is she?</q> He looked at me, all of a tremble. <q>Well,</q> thought I, <q>if
he's so frightened of me as all that, it's a bad look out!</q> And my
legs went weak with fright that he wouldn't let me in or would call
out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up, or something else might
happen. I don't remember now, but I must have stood pale, facing
him. I whispered to him, <q>Why, she's there, there, under the window;
<pb n='711'/><anchor id='Pg711'/>
how is it you don't see her?</q> I said. <q>Bring her then, bring
her.</q> <q>She's afraid,</q> said I; <q>she was frightened at the noise, she's
hidden in the bushes; go and call to her yourself from the study.</q>
He ran to the window, put the candle in the window. <q>Grushenka,</q>
he cried, <q>Grushenka, are you here?</q> Though he cried that, he
didn't want to lean out of the window, he didn't want to move away
from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn't
dare to turn his back on me. <q>Why, here she is,</q> said I. I went
up to the window and leaned right out of it. <q>Here she is; she's in
the bush, laughing at you, don't you see her?</q> He suddenly believed
it; he was all of a shake&mdash;he was awfully crazy about her&mdash;and
he leaned right out of the window. I snatched up that iron
paper-weight from his table; do you remember, weighing about three
pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the
corner of it. He didn't even cry out. He only sank down suddenly,
and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time I
knew I'd broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face
upwards, covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood
on me, not a spot. I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up
to the ikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung the
envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it. I went out into
the garden all of a tremble, straight to the apple-tree with a hollow
in it&mdash;you know that hollow. I'd marked it long before and put a
rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I wrapped all the notes in the
rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And there it stayed for
over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out of the
hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, <q>If Grigory
Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me,
but if he is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he'll
bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he
must have killed him and taken the money.</q> Then I began groaning
with suspense and impatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as
soon as possible. At last she got up and she rushed to me, but when
she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there, she ran out, and I
heard her scream in the garden. And that set it all going and set
my mind at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without
stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov
<pb n='712'/><anchor id='Pg712'/>
glanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept
his eyes averted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated
and was breathing hard. The perspiration stood out on his face.
But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he was feeling,
or what.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> cried Ivan, pondering. <q>What about the door? If he
only opened the door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open
before? For Grigory saw it before you went.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different
tone, not angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at
that moment and peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded
that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary, though
interesting, subject.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch's having seen it
open, that's only his fancy,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile.
<q>He is not a man, I assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn't
see it, but fancied he had seen it, and there's no shaking him. It's
just our luck he took that notion into his head, for they can't fail
to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch after that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen ...</q> said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and
making an effort to grasp something. <q>Listen. There are a lot of
questions I want to ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting
and getting mixed up. Yes. Tell me this at least, why
did you open the envelope and leave it there on the floor? Why
didn't you simply carry off the envelope?... When you were
telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the right
thing to do ... but why, I can't understand....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about
it, as I did for instance, if he'd seen those notes before, and perhaps
had put them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope
sealed up and addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done
the murder, what should have made him tear open the envelope
afterwards, especially in such desperate haste, since he'd know for
certain the notes must be in the envelope? No, if the robber had
been some one like me, he'd simply have put the envelope straight
in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he could. But it'd be
quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew about the
envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he'd found it, for
<pb n='713'/><anchor id='Pg713'/>
instance, under the mattress, he'd have torn it open as quickly as
possible to make sure the notes were in it. And he'd have thrown
the envelope down, without having time to think that it would be
evidence against him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had
never directly stolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born,
and if he did bring himself to steal, it would not be regular stealing,
but simply taking what was his own, for he'd told the whole town
he meant to before, and had even bragged aloud before every one
that he'd go and take his property from Fyodor Pavlovitch. I
didn't say that openly to the prosecutor when I was being examined,
but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as though I
didn't see it myself, and as though he'd thought of it himself and
I hadn't prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor's mouth positively
watered at my suggestion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?</q>
cried Ivan, overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov
again with alarm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate
hurry? It was all thought out beforehand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!</q> Ivan cried again.
<q>No, you are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....</q>
</p>

<p>
He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He
was in terrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there
was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only
turned round where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the
impossibility of moving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out
almost as furiously as before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don't you understand
that if I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am keeping
you to answer to-morrow at the trial. God sees,</q> Ivan raised
his hand, <q>perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret
desire for my father's ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty
as you think, and perhaps I didn't urge you on at all. No, no, I
didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence against
myself to-morrow at the trial. I'm determined to! I shall tell
everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance together.
And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence
you give, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you. I'll confirm
<pb n='714'/><anchor id='Pg714'/>
it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must, you must;
we'll go together. That's how it shall be!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes
alone it could be seen that it would be so.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,</q>
Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent
sympathy in fact.
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll go together,</q> Ivan repeated. <q>And if you won't go, no
matter, I'll go alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go,</q> he concluded
at last positively.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't understand me,</q> Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what's
more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I
never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill
(and it looks like it, too), or that you're so sorry for your brother
that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it
all against me, for you've always thought no more of me than if
I'd been a fly. And who will believe you, and what single proof
have you got?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take that money away with you,</q> Smerdyakov sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you
committed the murder for the sake of it?</q> Ivan looked at him
with great surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want it,</q> Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice,
with a gesture of refusal. <q>I did have an idea of beginning a new
life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream
of it, chiefly because <q>all things are lawful.</q> That was quite right
what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about that. For if
there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as virtue, and
there's no need of it. You were right there. So that's how I
looked at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you come to that of yourself?</q> asked Ivan, with a wry
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>With your guidance.</q>
</p>

<pb n='715'/><anchor id='Pg715'/>

<p>
<q>And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving
back the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe,</q> whispered Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then why are you giving it back?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave off ... that's enough!</q> Smerdyakov waved his hand
again. <q>You used to say yourself that everything was lawful, so
now why are you so upset, too? You even want to go and give
evidence against yourself.... Only there'll be nothing of the
sort! You won't go to give evidence,</q> Smerdyakov decided with
conviction.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll see,</q> said Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money,
I know that. You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud;
you are far too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most
of all about living in undisturbed comfort, without having to
depend on any one&mdash;that's what you care most about. You won't
want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself.
You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like him than
any of his children; you've the same soul as he had.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not a fool,</q> said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood
rushed to his face. <q>You are serious now!</q> he observed, looking suddenly
at Smerdyakov with a different expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the
money.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket
without wrapping them in anything.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall show them at the court to-morrow,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nobody will believe you, as you've plenty of money of your own;
you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought
it to the court.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>I repeat,</q> he said, <q>the only reason I haven't killed you is that I
need you for to-morrow, remember that, don't forget it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, kill me. Kill me now,</q> Smerdyakov said, all at once looking
strangely at Ivan. <q>You won't dare do that even!</q> he added,
with a bitter smile. <q>You won't dare to do anything, you, who
used to be so bold!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-morrow,</q> cried Ivan, and moved to go out.
</p>

<pb n='716'/><anchor id='Pg716'/>

<p>
<q>Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov
looked at them for ten seconds.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you can go,</q> he said, with a wave of his hand. <q>Ivan
Fyodorovitch!</q> he called after him again.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q> Ivan turned without stopping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-morrow!</q> Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps
boldly, but suddenly began staggering. <q>It's something physical,</q>
he thought with a grin. Something like joy was springing up in his
heart. He was conscious of unbounded resolution; he would make
an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late. His
determination was taken, <q>and now it will not be changed,</q> he
thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against something
and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his
feet the peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless.
The snow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized
him and lifted him in his arms. Seeing a light in the little house
to the right he went up, knocked at the shutters, and asked the man
to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the
police-station, promising him three roubles. The man got ready
and came out. I won't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his
object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging for
a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the
expenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but
Ivan was well content with it. His mind wandered and worked
incessantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,</q> he
reflected with satisfaction, <q>I should not have stayed a whole hour to
look after the peasant, but should have passed by, without caring
about his being frozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by
the way,</q> he thought at the same instant, with still greater satisfaction,
<q>although they have decided that I am going out of my
mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
Just as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself
suddenly hadn't he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell
<pb n='717'/><anchor id='Pg717'/>
him everything. He decided the question by turning back to the
house. <q>Everything together to-morrow!</q> he whispered to himself,
and, strange to say, almost all his gladness and self-satisfaction
passed in one instant.
</p>

<p>
As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice
on his heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of
something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at
that moment, and had been there before. He sank wearily on his
sofa. The old woman brought him a samovar; he made tea, but
did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt giddy. He felt that
he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop asleep, but got
up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness.
At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness that
he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round,
as though searching for something. This happened several times.
At last his eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled,
but an angry flush suffused his face. He sat a long time in his
place, his head propped on both arms, though he looked sideways at
the same point, at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall.
There was evidently something, some object, that irritated him there,
worried him and tormented him.

<head>Chapter IX. The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare</head>

<p>
I am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when
I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of
Ivan's illness. Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he
was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever.
Though his health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn
resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery
over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard
the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible effort of
will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of course,
to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he
loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching
<pb n='718'/><anchor id='Pg718'/>
crisis in his life, when he needed to have all his wits about him,
to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and <q>to justify
himself to himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been
brought from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's
to which I have referred already. After listening to him and examining
him the doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually
suffering from some disorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised
by an admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him.
<q>Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,</q> the doctor
opined, <q>though it would be better to verify them ... you must
take steps at once, without a moment's delay, or things will go
badly with you.</q> But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice
and did not take to his bed to be nursed. <q>I am walking about, so
I am strong enough, if I drop, it'll be different then, any one may
nurse me who likes,</q> he decided, dismissing the subject.
</p>

<p>
And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium
and, as I have said already, looking persistently at some object on
the sofa against the opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting
there, though goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not
been in the room when Ivan came into it, on his return from
Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a
Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young,
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>qui faisait la cinquantaine</foreign>,
as the French say, with rather long, still thick, dark
hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed beard. He
was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made
by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,
that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last
two years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such
as are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection
his linen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very
threadbare. The visitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but
were too light in color and too tight for the present fashion. His
soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season.
</p>

<p>
In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened
means. It looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class
of idle landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom.
He had unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable
<pb n='719'/><anchor id='Pg719'/>
society, had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them
indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished
on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor
relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to
another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating
disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could
be asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place
of honor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent
position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who
have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon
them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers.
Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always being
brought up at a distance, at some aunt's, to whom these gentlemen
never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the relationship.
They gradually lose sight of their children altogether, though at
intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and
sometimes even answer it.
</p>

<p>
The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured,
as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression
as occasion might arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell
lorgnette on a black ribbon. On the middle finger of his
right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it.
</p>

<p>
Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation.
The visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come
down from his room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly
silent, seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied.
But he was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host
should begin it. All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say,</q> he began to Ivan, <q>excuse me, I only mention it to remind
you. You went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina
Ivanovna, but you came away without finding out anything about
her, you probably forgot&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes,</q> broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with
uneasiness. <q>Yes, I'd forgotten ... but it doesn't matter now,
never mind, till to-morrow,</q> he muttered to himself, <q>and you,</q> he
added, addressing his visitor, <q>I should have remembered that myself
in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me! Why
<pb n='720'/><anchor id='Pg720'/>
do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me, and
that I didn't remember it of myself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't believe it then,</q> said the gentleman, smiling amicably,
<q>what's the good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs
are no help to believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed,
not because he saw Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe,
before he saw. Look at the spiritualists, for instance.... I am
very fond of them ... only fancy, they imagine that they are
serving the cause of religion, because the devils show them their
horns from the other world. That, they say, is a material proof, so
to speak, of the existence of another world. The other world and
material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does proving
there's a devil prove that there's a God? I want to join an idealist
society, I'll lead the opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist, but not
a materialist, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen,</q> Ivan suddenly got up from the table. <q>I seem to be
delirious.... I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like,
I don't care! You won't drive me to fury, as you did last time.
But I feel somehow ashamed.... I want to walk about the room....
I sometimes don't see you and don't even hear your voice as
I did last time, but I always guess what you are prating, for it's I,
<emph>I myself speaking, not you</emph>. Only I don't know whether I was
dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I'll wet a towel
and put it on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and
with a wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,</q> the visitor began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>do you suppose I should stand on ceremony
with you? I am in good spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead ...
and in the top of my head ... only please don't talk
philosophy, as you did last time. If you can't take yourself off,
talk of something amusing. Talk gossip, you are a poor relation,
you ought to talk gossip. What a nightmare to have! But I am not
afraid of you. I'll get the better of you. I won't be taken to a
mad-house!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est charmant</foreign>,
poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape.
For what am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am
listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually
<pb n='721'/><anchor id='Pg721'/>
beginning to take me for something real, not simply your fancy, as
you persisted in declaring last time&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,</q> Ivan cried
with a sort of fury. <q>You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a
phantom. It's only that I don't know how to destroy you and I see
I must suffer for a time. You are my hallucination. You are the
incarnation of myself, but only of one side of me ... of my
thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and stupidest of them.
From that point of view you might be of interest to me, if only
I had time to waste on you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, excuse me, I'll catch you. When you flew out at
Alyosha under the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him,
<q>You learnt it from <emph>him</emph>! How do you know that <emph>he</emph> visits
me?</q> you were thinking of me then. So for one brief moment you did
believe that I really exist,</q> the gentleman laughed blandly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn't believe
in you. I don't know whether I was asleep or awake last time.
Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn't see you really at all&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a
dear; I've treated him badly over Father Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!</q> Ivan
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You scold me, but you laugh&mdash;that's a good sign. But you are
ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why:
that great resolution of yours&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't speak of my resolution,</q> cried Ivan, savagely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, I understand, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>c'est noble,
c'est charmant</foreign>, you are
going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ...
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est chevaleresque</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, I'll kick you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained.
If you kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don't
kick ghosts. Joking apart, it doesn't matter to me, scold if you
like, though it's better to be a trifle more polite even to me. <q>Fool,
flunkey!</q> what words!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Scolding you, I scold myself,</q> Ivan laughed again, <q>you are
myself, myself, only with a different face. You just say what I am
thinking ... and are incapable of saying anything new!</q>
</p>

<pb n='722'/><anchor id='Pg722'/>

<p>
<q>If I am like you in my way of thinking, it's all to my credit,</q>
the gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.
</p>

<p>
<q>You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what's more, the
stupid ones. You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid.
No, I can't put up with you! What am I to do, what am I to do?</q>
Ivan said through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman
and to be recognized as such,</q> the visitor began in an excess
of deprecating and simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation.
<q>I am poor, but ... I won't say very honest, but ... it's an
axiom generally accepted in society that I am a fallen angel. I
certainly can't conceive how I can ever have been an angel. If I
ever was, it must have been so long ago that there's no harm in
forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a gentlemanly
person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I
love men genuinely, I've been greatly calumniated! Here when I
stay with you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality
and that's what I like most of all. You see, like you, I suffer
from the fantastic and so I love the realism of earth. Here, with
you, everything is circumscribed, here all is formulated and geometrical,
while we have nothing but indeterminate equations! I
wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming. Besides, on earth
I become superstitious. Please don't laugh, that's just what I like,
to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I've grown
fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go
and steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is
becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of
some merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all
she believes. My ideal is to go to church and offer a candle in
simple-hearted faith, upon my word it is. Then there would be an
end to my sufferings. I like being doctored too; in the spring there
was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was vaccinated in a
foundling hospital&mdash;if only you knew how I enjoyed myself that
day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But
you are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this
evening? I know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well,
what about your health? What did the doctor say?</q>
</p>

<pb n='723'/><anchor id='Pg723'/>

<p>
<q>Fool!</q> Ivan snapped out.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn't
ask out of sympathy. You needn't answer. Now rheumatism has
come in again&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool!</q> repeated Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of
rheumatism last year that I remember it to this day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil have rheumatism!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly
form and I take the consequences. Satan <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sum
et nihil humanum a me alienum puto</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, what, Satan <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sum
et nihil humanum</foreign> ... that's not bad
for the devil!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad I've pleased you at last.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you didn't get that from me.</q> Ivan stopped suddenly,
seeming struck. <q>That never entered my head, that's strange.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est du nouveau,
n'est-ce pas?</foreign> This time I'll act honestly and
explain to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from
indigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions,
such complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world
of events, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from
the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear
Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such dreams are sometimes
seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people, officials, journalists,
priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A statesman
confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him
when he was asleep. Well, that's how it is now, though I am your
hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which
had not entered your head before. So I don't repeat your ideas, yet
I am only your nightmare, nothing more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and
are not my nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I've adopted a special method to-day, I'll explain
it to you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I
caught cold then, only not here but yonder.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Can't you
go away?</q> Ivan exclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to
<pb n='724'/><anchor id='Pg724'/>
and fro, sat down on the sofa, leaned his elbows on the table again
and held his head tight in both hands. He pulled the wet towel off
and flung it away in vexation. It was evidently of no use.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your nerves are out of order,</q> observed the gentleman, with
a carelessly easy, though perfectly polite, air. <q>You are angry with
me even for being able to catch cold, though it happened in a most
natural way. I was hurrying then to a diplomatic
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirée</foreign> at the house
of a lady of high rank in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in
the Ministry. Well, an evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was
God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth....
Of course, it took only an instant, but you know a ray of light
from the sun takes full eight minutes, and fancy in an evening suit
and open waistcoat. Spirits don't freeze, but when one's in fleshly
form, well ... in brief, I didn't think, and set off, and you know
in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is above the firmament,
there's such a frost ... at least one can't call it frost, you can
fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game the village
girls play&mdash;they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees
of frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin
off, so it bleeds. But that's only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I
imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it
would be the end of it ... if only there could be an ax there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And can there be an ax there?</q> Ivan interrupted, carelessly and
disdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe
in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.
</p>

<p>
<q>An ax?</q> the guest interrupted in surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what would become of an ax there?</q> Ivan cried suddenly,
with a sort of savage and insistent obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
<q>What would become of an ax in space?
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Quelle idée!</foreign> If it were
to fall to any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the
earth without knowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would
calculate the rising and the setting of the ax, <hi rend='italic'>Gatzuk</hi> would put
it in his calendar, that's all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are stupid, awfully stupid,</q> said Ivan peevishly. <q>Fib more
cleverly or I won't listen. You want to get the better of me by
realism, to convince me that you exist, but I don't want to believe
you exist! I won't believe it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not fibbing, it's all the truth; the truth is unhappily
<pb n='725'/><anchor id='Pg725'/>
hardly ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big
of me, and perhaps something fine. That's a great pity, for I only
give what I can&mdash;</q>

<q>Don't talk philosophy, you ass!</q>

<q>Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am
moaning and groaning. I've tried all the medical faculty: they can
diagnose beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their
finger-tips, but they've no idea how to cure you. There was an
enthusiastic little student here, <q>You may die,</q> said he, <q>but you'll
know perfectly what disease you are dying of!</q> And then what a
way they have sending people to specialists! <q>We only diagnose,</q>
they say, <q>but go to such-and-such a specialist, he'll cure you.</q>
The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of disease has completely
disappeared, I assure you, now there are only specialists and they all
advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrong with your nose,
they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European specialist who
cures noses. If you go to Paris, he'll look at your nose; I can only
cure your right nostril, he'll tell you, for I don't cure the left
nostril, that's not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there's a
specialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I
fell back on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub

extra bath I went, smeared myself all over and it did me no good
at all. In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a
book and some drops, bless him, and, only fancy, Hoff's malt extract
cured me! I bought it by accident, drank a bottle and a half of it,
and I was ready to dance, it took it away completely. I made up
my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I was prompted
by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a
bother: not a single paper would take my letter. <q>It would be very
reactionary,</q> they said, <q>no one will believe it.

You'd better remain anonymous,</q> they advised me. What
use is a letter of thanks if it's anonymous? I laughed with the men
at the newspaper office; <q>It's reactionary to believe in God in our
days,</q> I said, <q>but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.</q> <q>We quite
understand that,</q> they said. <q>Who doesn't believe in the devil?
Yet it won't do, it might injure our reputation. As a joke, if you
like.</q> But I thought as a joke it wouldn't be very witty. So it
