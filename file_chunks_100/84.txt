</p>

<p>
<q>She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more
comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>
Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively
glittered in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just
now,</q> he said. <q>Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll
let you go back to the monastery.... I was joking this morning,
don't be angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha,
comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me the truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're still asking whether she has been here or not?</q> Alyosha
said sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to
Grushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her;
see for yourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh?
What? Can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If I see her I'll ask her,</q> Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't tell you,</q> the old man interrupted, <q>she's a rogue.
She'll begin kissing you and say that it's you she wants. She's a deceitful,
shameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you mustn't!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, father, and it wouldn't be suitable, it wouldn't be right
at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where was he sending you just now? He shouted <q>Go</q> as he
ran away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For money? To ask her for money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No. Not for money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's no money; not a farthing. I'll settle down for the night,
and think things over, and you can go. Perhaps you'll meet her....
Only be sure to come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be
sure to. I have a word to say to you to-morrow. Will you come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When you come, pretend you've come of your own accord to ask
after me. Don't tell any one I told you to. Don't say a word to
Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall
never forget it. I've a word to say to you to-morrow&mdash;but I must
think about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how do you feel now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>

<p>
<q>I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly
well!</q>
</p>

<p>
Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at
the gateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his
note-book. Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was
conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,</q>
said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete
surprise to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow,</q> answered Alyosha, <q>I
may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you're going to her now, anyway? For that <q>compliments
and farewell,</q></q> said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part
of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say
that he&mdash;well, in fact&mdash;takes his leave of her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, how will all this horror end between father and
Dmitri?</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle
out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old
man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look
at other men and decide which is worthy to live?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often
decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And
as for rights&mdash;who has not the right to wish?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not for another man's death?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since
all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring
to what I said just now&mdash;that one reptile will devour the other?
In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable
of shedding Æsop's blood, murdering him, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my
mind. I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, if only for that,</q> smiled Ivan. <q>Be sure, I should always
defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in
this case. Good-by till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't
look on me as a villain,</q> he added with a smile.
</p>

<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>

<p>
They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha
felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and
that he had certainly done this with some definite motive.

<p>
Alyosha left his father's house feeling even more exhausted
and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind
too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid
to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea
from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He
felt something bordering upon despair, which he had never known
till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the
fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his father
and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had
himself been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them
face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy,
terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It
appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so
than Alyosha could have supposed before. There was something
positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him,
which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he felt
for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women?
Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna's
in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind.
On the contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find
guidance from her. Yet to give her this message was obviously
more difficult than before. The matter of the three thousand was
decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and
losing his last hope, might sink to any depth. He had, moreover,
told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just
taken place with his father.
</p>

<p>
It was by now seven o'clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha
entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street
occupied by Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
two aunts. One of them, a woman of little education, was that
aunt of her half-sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her
in her father's house when she came from boarding-school. The
other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence, though in
straitened circumstances. It was said that they both gave way
in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept them
with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no
one but her benefactress, the general's widow, who had been kept
by illness in Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice
a week a full account of all her doings.
</p>

<p>
When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened
the door to him to take his name up, it was evident that they were
already aware of his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the
window. At least, Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying
footsteps and rustling skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had
run out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such
excitement. He was conducted however to the drawing-room at
once. It was a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at all
in provincial style. There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and
little tables. There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on
the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window.
It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made out a silk mantle
thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just been
sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups
of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another
with sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and
frowned. But at that instant the portière was raised, and with
rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out
both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight. At the
same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them
on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God! At last you have come too! I've been simply
praying for you all day! Sit down.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when,
three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina
Ivanovna's special request, to be introduced to her. There had been
no conversation between them at that interview, however. Supposing
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the
time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha had been silent, but he had
seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck by the imperiousness,
proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl. And all that
was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He
thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with
her pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in
the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his
brother might well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could
not be loved for long. He expressed this thought almost plainly
to Dmitri when, after the visit, his brother besought and insisted
that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be happy with her, but perhaps&mdash;not tranquilly happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They
don't yield to fate. So you think I shan't love her for ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won't
always be happy with her.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry
with himself for having yielded to his brother's entreaties and put
such <q>foolish</q> ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as
awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed
too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman. It
was with the more amazement that he felt now, at the first glance
at Katerina Ivanovna as she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been
utterly mistaken. This time her face was beaming with spontaneous
good-natured kindliness, and direct warm-hearted sincerity. The
<q>pride and haughtiness,</q> which had struck Alyosha so much before,
was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy and a sort of
bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the first glance,
at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in relation to
the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she perhaps
already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite
of that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the
future. Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in
his thoughts. He was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides
all this, he noticed at her first words that she was in great
excitement, an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost
approaching ecstasy.
</p>

<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>

<p>
<q>I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole
truth&mdash;from you and no one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have come,</q> muttered Alyosha confusedly, <q>I&mdash;he sent me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything&mdash;everything!</q>
cried Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. <q>Wait a
moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I'll tell you why I've been so longing
to see you. You see, I know perhaps far more than you do yourself,
and there's no need for you to tell me anything. I'll tell you what I
want from you. I want to know your own last impression of him.
I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely even (oh, as
coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and of
his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps
be better than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does
not want to come to me. Do you understand what I want from
you? Now, tell me simply, tell me every word of the message he
sent you with (I knew he would send you).</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He told me to give you his compliments&mdash;and to say that he
would never come again&mdash;but to give you his compliments.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His compliments? Was that what he said&mdash;his own expression?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps
he did not use the right word?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me
two or three times not to forget to say so.</q>
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your
help. I'll tell you what I think, and you must simply say whether
it's right or not. Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in
passing, without insisting on your repeating the words, without
emphasizing them, that would be the end of everything! But if he
particularly insisted on those words, if he particularly told you not
to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he was in excitement,
beside himself. He had made his decision and was frightened at it.
He wasn't walking away from me with a resolute step, but leaping
headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply
bravado.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes!</q> cried Alyosha warmly. <q>I believe that is it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And, if so, he's not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay!
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
Did he not tell you anything about money&mdash;about three thousand
roubles?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He did speak about it, and it's that more than anything that's
crushing him. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing
matters now,</q> Alyosha answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope
in his heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape
and salvation for his brother. <q>But do you know about the money?</q>
he added, and suddenly broke off.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire,
and heard long ago that the money had not arrived. He
hadn't sent the money, but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that
he was still in need of money. My only object in all this was that
he should know to whom to turn, and who was his true friend.
No, he won't recognize that I am his truest friend; he won't know
me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I've been tormented all
the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed
to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel
ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people's knowing,
but not of my knowing. He can tell God everything without
shame. Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready
to bear for his sake? Why, why doesn't he know me? How dare
he not know me after all that has happened? I want to save him
for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed. And here he fears
that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn't afraid to be open
with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don't deserve the
same?</q>
</p>

<p>
The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must tell you,</q> Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, <q>what
happened just now between him and my father.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to
get the money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and
after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take
his compliments and farewell. <q>He went to that woman,</q> Alyosha
added softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you suppose that I can't put up with that woman?
Does he think I can't? But he won't marry her,</q> she suddenly
laughed nervously. <q>Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov?
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
It's passion, not love. He won't marry her because she
won't marry him.</q> Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely.
</p>

<p>
<q>He may marry her,</q> said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
</p>

<p>
<q>He won't marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you
know that? Do you know that?</q> Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed
suddenly with extraordinary warmth. <q>She is one of the most fantastic
of fantastic creatures. I know how bewitching she is, but I
know too that she is kind, firm and noble. Why do you look at
me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are wondering at
my words, perhaps you don't believe me? Agrafena Alexandrovna,
my angel!</q> she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the next
room, <q>come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He
knows all about our affairs. Show yourself to him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,</q>
said a soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.
</p>

<p>
The portière was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming,
came up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha.
He fixed his eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she
was, that awful woman, the <q>beast,</q> as Ivan had called her half an
hour before. And yet one would have thought the creature standing
before him most simple and ordinary, a good-natured, kind woman,
handsome certainly, but so like other handsome ordinary women!
It is true she was very, very good-looking with that Russian beauty
so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall woman,
though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was exceptionally
tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were, noiseless, movements,
softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her voice. She
moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step, but
noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She
sank softly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk
dress, and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders
in a costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old,
and her face looked exactly that age. She was very white in the
face, with a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The modeling of her
face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle
forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower
lip was at least twice as full, and looked pouting. But her magnificent,
abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have
made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd
in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long
after. What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of
childlike good nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look
of childish delight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight
and seeming to expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding
curiosity. The light in her eyes gladdened the soul&mdash;Alyosha
felt that. There was something else in her which he could not
understand, or would not have been able to define, and which yet
perhaps unconsciously affected him. It was that softness, that
voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that catlike noiselessness.
Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl could be seen
full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her figure
suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in somewhat
exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs
of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this
fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of
thirty, would <q>spread</q>; that the face would become puffy, and that
wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the
eyes; the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps&mdash;in fact,
that it was the beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so
often met with in Russian women. Alyosha, of course, did not
think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he wondered with
an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she drawled
in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently
feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation
of the syllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that
showed bad education and a false idea of good manners. And yet
this intonation and manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost
incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression
of her face, the soft, babyish joy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna
at once made her sit down in an arm-chair facing Alyosha, and
ecstatically kissed her several times on her smiling lips. She seemed
quite in love with her.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the first time we've met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she said
rapturously. <q>I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to
her, but I'd no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>
knew we should settle everything together&mdash;everything. My heart
told me so&mdash;I was begged not to take the step, but I foresaw it
would be a way out of the difficulty, and I was not mistaken.
Grushenka has explained everything to me, told me all she means
to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness and brought us peace
and joy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,</q> drawled
Grushenka in her sing-song voice, still with the same charming
smile of delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch!
Disdain you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks
as though it were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and
more. Look how she laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one's
heart good to see the angel.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running
down him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am
not at all worthy of your kindness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not worthy! She's not worthy of it!</q> Katerina Ivanovna cried
again with the same warmth. <q>You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
we're fanciful, we're self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our
little heart. We're noble, we're generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let
me tell you. We have only been unfortunate. We were too ready
to make every sacrifice for an unworthy, perhaps, or fickle man.
There was one man&mdash;one, an officer too, we loved him, we sacrificed
everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago, and he has
forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has written,
he is coming here, and, do you know, we've loved him, none but
him, all this time, and we've loved him all our life! He will come,
and Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she's
been wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her
favor? Only that bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her
father, her friend, her protector. He found her then in despair, in
agony, deserted by the man she loved. She was ready to drown herself
then, but the old merchant saved her&mdash;saved her!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a
great hurry about everything,</q> Grushenka drawled again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
defend you? Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that
charming soft little hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It
has brought me happiness and has lifted me up, and I'm going to
kiss it, outside and inside, here, here, here!</q>
</p>

<p>
And three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather
fat, hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand
with a charming musical, nervous little laugh, watched the <q>sweet
young lady,</q> and obviously liked having her hand kissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps there's rather too much rapture,</q> thought Alyosha. He
blushed. He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand
like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think I meant to make you blush?</q> said Katerina Ivanovna,
somewhat surprised. <q>Ah, my dear, how little you understand
me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young
lady. Maybe I'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart;
I will have my own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch
that day simply for fun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But now you'll save him. You've given me your word. You'll
explain it all to him. You'll break to him that you have long loved
another man, who is now offering you his hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no! I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you
kept talking about that. I didn't give you my word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then I didn't quite understand you,</q> said Katerina Ivanovna
slowly, turning a little pale. <q>You promised&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, angel lady, I've promised nothing,</q> Grushenka interrupted
softly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression.
<q>You see at once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I
am compared with you. If I want to do a thing I do it. I may
have made you some promise just now. But now again I'm thinking:
I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much once&mdash;liked
him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him
to stay with me from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just now you said&mdash;something quite different,</q> Katerina Ivanovna
whispered faintly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, just now! But, you know. I'm such a soft-hearted, silly
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
creature. Only think what he's gone through on my account!
What if when I go home I feel sorry for him? What then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never expected&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with
me! Now perhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now
you know my character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic
lady,</q> she said tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina
Ivanovna's hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you
did mine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours
three hundred times to be even with you. Well, but let that pass.
And then it shall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave
entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave. Let it be as God
wills, without any agreements and promises. What a sweet hand&mdash;what
a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you incredible
beauty!</q>
</p>

<p>
She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object
indeed of <q>being even</q> with her in kisses.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with
timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her
bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently
into her eyes; she still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted,
confiding expression, the same bright gayety.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's perhaps too naïve,</q> thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a
gleam of hope.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the <q>sweet hand.</q>
She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three
minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, angel lady,</q> she suddenly drawled in an even
more soft and sugary voice, <q>do you know, after all, I think I won't
kiss your hand?</q> And she laughed a little merry laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>As you please. What's the matter with you?</q> said Katerina
Ivanovna, starting suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand,
but I didn't kiss yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness
at Katerina Ivanovna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Insolent creature!</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from
her seat.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka too got up, but without haste.
</p>

<p>
<q>So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss
yours at all. And how he will laugh!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Vile slut! Go away!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming
for you, dear young lady, a word like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away! You're a creature for sale!</q> screamed Katerina
Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face.
</p>

<p>
<q>For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for
money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.</q>
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but
Alyosha held her with all his strength.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll
go away&mdash;she'll go at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry,
and with them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go away,</q> said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the
sofa. <q>Alyosha, darling, see me home!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away&mdash;go away, make haste!</q> cried Alyosha, clasping his
hands imploringly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little story
to tell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha.
See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out
of the house, laughing musically.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and
was shaken with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I warned you,</q> said the elder of her aunts. <q>I tried to prevent
your doing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a
thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she's worse
than any of them. You are too self-willed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She's a tigress!</q> yelled Katerina Ivanovna. <q>Why did you hold
me, Alexey Fyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her&mdash;beaten her!</q>
</p>

<p>
She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did
not care to, indeed.
</p>

<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>

<p>
<q>She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha withdrew towards the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, my God!</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands.
<q>He! He! He could be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he
told that creature what happened on that fatal, accursed day! <q>You
brought your beauty for sale, dear young lady.</q> She knows it!
Your brother's a scoundrel, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn't find a word.
His heart ached.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful, it's awful for
me! To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don't
condemn me. Forgive me. I don't know what I shall do with myself
now!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept
as she did. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
</p>

<p>
<q>The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame
Hohlakov; it's been left with us since dinner-time.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it,
almost unconsciously, into his pocket.
</p>

<head>Chapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined</head>

<p>
It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the
town to the monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road,
at that hour deserted. It was almost night, and too dark to see
anything clearly at thirty paces ahead. There were cross-roads
half-way. A figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the
cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-roads the figure
moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:
</p>

<p>
<q>Your money or your life!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So it's you, Mitya,</q> cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled
however.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha ha ha! You didn't expect me? I wondered where to wait
for you. By her house? There are three ways from it, and I might
have missed you. At last I thought of waiting here, for you had to
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
pass here, there's no other way to the monastery. Come, tell me
the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But what's the matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing, brother&mdash;it's the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri!
Father's blood just now.</q> (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on
the verge of tears for a long time, and now something seemed to
snap in his soul.) <q>You almost killed him&mdash;cursed him&mdash;and
now&mdash;here&mdash;you're
making jokes&mdash;<q>Your money or your life!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what of that? It's not seemly&mdash;is that it? Not suitable in
my position?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No&mdash;I only&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what
clouds, what a wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting
for you. And as God's above, I suddenly thought, why go on in
misery any longer, what is there to wait for? Here I have a willow,
a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist them into a rope in a minute,
and braces besides, and why go on burdening the earth, dishonoring
it with my vile presence? And then I heard you coming&mdash;Heavens,
it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So there is
a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little
brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only
one I love in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that
moment that I thought, <q>I'll fall on his neck at once.</q> Then a stupid
idea struck me, to have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted,
like a fool, <q>Your money!</q> Forgive my foolery&mdash;it was only nonsense,
and there's nothing unseemly in my soul.... Damn it all,
tell me what's happened. What did she say? Strike me, crush me,
don't spare me! Was she furious?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There&mdash;I
found them both there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Both? Whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna's.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri was struck dumb.
</p>

<p>
<q>Impossible!</q> he cried. <q>You're raving! Grushenka with her?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he
went in to Katerina Ivanovna's. He was ten minutes telling his
story. He can't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively,
but he seemed to make it clear, not omitting any word or action
of significance, and vividly describing, often in one word, his own
<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>
sensations. Dmitri listened in silence, gazing at him with a terrible
fixed stare, but it was clear to Alyosha that he understood it all,
and had grasped every point. But as the story went on, his face
became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He scowled, he clenched
his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more rigid, more concentrated,
more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible rapidity, his
wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips parted,
and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous
laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he
could not speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>So she wouldn't kiss her hand! So she didn't kiss it; so she ran
away!</q> he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight
it might have been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. <q>So
the other one called her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought
to be flogged on a scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That's just
what I think; she ought to have been long ago. It's like this,
brother, let her be punished, but I must get better first. I understand
the queen of impudence. That's her all over! You saw her
all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She's magnificent in
her own line! So she ran home? I'll go&mdash;ah&mdash;I'll run to her!
Alyosha, don't blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But Katerina Ivanovna!</q> exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>I see her, too! I see right through her, as I've never done before!
It's a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is,
of the five! What a thing to do! That's just like Katya, who was
not afraid to face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly
insult on a generous impulse to save her father! But the pride, the
recklessness, the defiance of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say
that aunt tried to stop her? That aunt, you know, is overbearing,
herself. She's the sister of the general's widow in Moscow, and even
more stuck-up than she. But her husband was caught stealing
government money. He lost everything, his estate and all, and the
proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn't raised them since. So
she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn't listen to her! She
thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will give way
to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and
she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault
is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka's hand first, on purpose,
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by Grushenka, that's
to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her own delusion&mdash;because
it was <emph>her</emph> dream, <emph>her</emph> delusion! Alyosha, darling, how
did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up your
cassock and run? Ha ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted
Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she
flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in
secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that
insult?</q>
</p>

<p>
What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as
it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's
humiliation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bah!</q> Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with
his hand. He only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told
him of the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: <q>Your brother is
a scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that <q>fatal day,</q>
as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time
at Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was
sobbing. I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's
image, and Grushenka understood it. She understood it all then. I
remember, she cried herself.... Damn it all! But it's bound to
be so now.... Then she cried, but now <q>the dagger in the heart</q>!
That's how women are.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked down and sank into thought.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!</q> he said suddenly,
in a gloomy voice. <q>It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm
a scoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort.
Come, that's enough. Good-by. It's no use talking! It's not
amusing. You go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see
you again except as a last resource. Good-by, Alexey!</q>
</p>

<p>
He warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down, without
raising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly
towards the town.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away
so abruptly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!</q> cried Dmitri,
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
suddenly turning back. <q>Look at me. Look at me well. You see
here, here&mdash;there's terrible disgrace in store for me.</q> (As he said
<q>here,</q> Dmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air, as
though the dishonor lay precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a
pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his neck.) <q>You know me now,
a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've never
done anything before and never shall again, anything that can compare
in baseness with the dishonor which I bear now at this very
minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass, though
I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it through, note
that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I shan't stop
it. I told you everything just now, but I didn't tell you this, because
even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if I do,
I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I
shan't pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear
witness that I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction!
No need to explain. You'll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley
and the she-devil. Good-by. Don't pray for me, I'm not
worth it. And there's no need, no need at all.... I don't need it!
Away!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards
the monastery.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?</q> he
wondered wildly. <q>Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I
shall look him up. I shall make a point of it. What does he mean?</q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the
hermitage. The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted
at that hour. There was a tremor in his heart as he went into
Father Zossima's cell.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the
world? Here was peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion,
there was darkness in which one lost one's way and went
astray at once....</q>
</p>

<p>
In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Païssy, who
came every hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt
with alarm that he was getting worse and worse. Even his usual
discourse with the brothers could not take place that day. As a
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>
rule every evening after service the monks flocked into Father
Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their sins of the day, their
sinful thoughts and temptations; even their disputes, if there had
been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder absolved, reconciled,
exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them. It was
against this general <q>confession</q> that the opponents of <q>elders</q> protested,
maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament of
confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different thing.
They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such confessions
attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led
to sin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the
elder, and went against their own will because every one went, and
for fear they should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People
said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, <q>I'll confess
I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,</q>
simply in order to have something to say. Alyosha knew that this
actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among
the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from
relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read
by him before those to whom they were addressed.
</p>

<p>
It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in
good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance.
But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much
that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more
experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that
<q>for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation,
such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of
great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and
repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering
the monastery&mdash;their proper place is in the world. Even in the
temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no
good taking it too much into account.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,</q> Father Païssy
whispered to Alyosha, as he blessed him. <q>It's difficult to rouse
him. And he must not be roused. He waked up for five minutes,
sent his blessing to the brothers, and begged their prayers for him
at night. He intends to take the sacrament again in the morning.
He remembered you, Alexey. He asked whether you had gone
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
away, and was told that you were in the town. <q>I blessed him for
that work,</q> he said, <q>his place is there, not here, for awhile.</q> Those
were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with
anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it
that he has decided that you shall spend some time in the world?
He must have foreseen something in your destiny! Understand,
Alexey, that if you return to the world, it must be to do the duty
laid upon you by your elder, and not for frivolous vanity and
worldly pleasures.</q>
</p>

<p>
Father Païssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father
Zossima was dying, though he might live another day or two.
Alyosha firmly and ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to
his father, the Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not
leave the monastery next day, but would remain with his elder to
the end. His heart glowed with love, and he reproached himself
bitterly for having been able for one instant to forget him whom
he had left in the monastery on his deathbed, and whom he honored
above every one in the world. He went into Father Zossima's bedroom,
knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder, who
slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing
and a peaceful face.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had
received his guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay
down on the hard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used
as a bed, bringing nothing but a pillow. The mattress, about which
his father had shouted to him that morning, he had long forgotten
to lie on. He took off his cassock, which he used as a covering. But
before going to bed, he fell on his knees and prayed a long time.
In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to lighten his darkness
but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which always visited his
soul after the praise and adoration, of which his evening prayer
usually consisted. That joy always brought him light untroubled
sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the little
pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina Ivanovna's.
He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after some hesitation,
he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed by
Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at
him before the elder in the morning.
</p>

<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she wrote, <q rend='pre'>I am writing to you without
any one's knowledge, even mamma's, and I know how wrong it is.
But I cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung
up in my heart, and this no one but us two must know for a time.
But how am I to say what I want so much to tell you? Paper, they
say, does not blush, but I assure you it's not true and that it's
blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha, I love you, I've
loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when you
were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you
all my life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass
them together till our old age. Of course, on condition that you
will leave the monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time
fixed by the law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I
shall be walking and dancing. There can be no doubt of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>You see how I've thought of everything. There's only one thing
I can't imagine: what you'll think of me when you read this. I'm
always laughing and being naughty. I made you angry this morning,
but I assure you before I took up my pen, I prayed before the
Image of the Mother of God, and now I'm praying, and almost
crying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don't
know how I shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if
I can't restrain myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as
I did to-day. You'll think I'm a nasty girl making fun of you, and
you won't believe my letter. And so I beg you, dear one, if you've
any pity for me, when you come to-morrow, don't look me straight
in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it will be sure to make me laugh,
especially as you'll be in that long gown. I feel cold all over when
I think of it, so when you come, don't look at me at all for a time,
look at mamma or at the window....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here I've written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done?
Alyosha, don't despise me, and if I've done something very horrid
and wounded you, forgive me. Now the secret of my reputation,

<p>
Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice,
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>
thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He
started. That laugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he
laughed again just as softly and happily. He slowly replaced the
note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down. The agitation
in his heart passed at once. <q>God, have mercy upon all of them,
have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set
them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them according
to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!</q>
Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.

<head>Chapter I. Father Ferapont</head>

<p>
Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima
woke up feeling very weak, though he wanted to get out of
bed and sit up in a chair. His mind was quite clear; his face looked
very tired, yet bright and almost joyful. It wore an expression of
gayety, kindness and cordiality. <q>Maybe I shall not live through
the coming day,</q> he said to Alyosha. Then he desired to confess
and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to Father
Païssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction
followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled
up by the inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight.
People began coming from the monastery. After the service was
over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one. As the
cell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for
others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was seated again in his
arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his voice was
weak, it was fairly steady.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been
talking aloud so many years, that I've got into the habit of talking,
and so much so that it's almost more difficult for me to hold my
tongue than to talk, even now, in spite of my weakness, dear
Fathers and brothers,</q> he jested, looking with emotion at the group
round him.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to
them. But though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly
steady, his speech was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many
<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>
things, he seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything
he had not said in his life, and not simply for the sake of
instructing them, but as though thirsting to share with all men and
all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more in his life to open his
whole heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Love one another, Fathers,</q> said Father Zossima, as far as
Alyosha could remember afterwards. <q>Love God's people. Because
we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no
holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the
very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he
is worse than others, than all men on earth.... And the longer
the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognize
that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he
realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible
to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national
and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For
know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for
all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general
sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and
every individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the
monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men,
but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge,
our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love.
Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole
world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your
tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess
your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even
when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions
with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither
to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who
insult you, who abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the
teachers of evil, the materialists&mdash;and I mean not only the good
ones&mdash;for there are many good ones among them, especially in our
day&mdash;hate not even the wicked ones. Remember them in your
prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none to pray for
them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not in
pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all
men.... Love God's people, let not strangers draw away the
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride,
or worse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and
draw away your flock. Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ...
be not extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver,
do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to the banner and raise
it on high.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported
his words afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though
to take breath, and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of
ecstasy. They heard him with emotion, though many wondered at
his words and found them obscure.... Afterwards all remembered
those words.
</p>

<p>
When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was
struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who
were crowding about it. This anticipation showed itself in some by
anxiety, in others by devout solemnity. All were expecting that
some marvel would happen immediately after the elder's death.
Their suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but
even the most austere of the monks were affected by it. Father
Païssy's face looked the gravest of all.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin,
who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from
Madame Hohlakov. In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and
very opportune incident. It appeared that among the women who
had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima's blessing,
there had been an old woman from the town, a sergeant's widow,
called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might pray for
the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk,
and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima
had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to
pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery.
He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added,
<q>as though reading the book of the future</q> (this was Madame
Hohlakov's expression), words of comfort: <q>that her son Vassya
was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly
or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.</q> And
<q>Would you believe it?</q> exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically,
<q>the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
that.</q> Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave
her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was
not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg,
Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an
official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped
<q>to embrace his mother.</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new
<q>miracle of prediction</q> to the Superior and all the brotherhood.
<q>All, all, ought to know of it!</q> she concluded. The letter had been
written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every
line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew
of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his
message <q>to inform most respectfully his reverence Father Païssy,
that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him, of such gravity
that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness
for his presumption.</q> As the monk had given the message to
Father Païssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading
the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to
Father Païssy in confirmation of the story.
</p>

<p>
And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as
he read the news of the <q>miracle,</q> could not completely restrain
some inner emotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn
smile came into his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see greater things!</q> broke from him.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see greater things, greater things yet!</q> the monks
around repeated.
</p>

<p>
But Father Païssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least
for a time, not to speak of the matter <q>till it be more fully confirmed,
seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world,
and indeed this might well have chanced naturally,</q> he added,
prudently, as it were to satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing
his own disavowal, a fact his listeners very clearly perceived.
</p>

<p>
Within the hour the <q>miracle</q> was of course known to the whole
monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one
seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day
before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in
the far North. It was he who had been standing near Madame
Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly,
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>
referring to the <q>healing</q> of the lady's daughter, <q>How can you
presume to do such things?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe.
The evening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his
cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and
overawed by the visit. This Father Ferapont was that aged monk so
devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned already,
as antagonistic to Father Zossima and the whole institution
of <q>elders,</q> which he regarded as a pernicious and frivolous innovation.
He was a very formidable opponent, although from his practice
of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made
him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling,
and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and
ascetic, although they had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was
just his craziness attracted them.
</p>

<p>
Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived
in the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and
this too because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was
seventy-five or more, and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary
in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for
another great ascetic, Father Iona, who had lived to be a hundred
and five, and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still
extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in
this same solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant's
hut, though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary
number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them&mdash;which
men brought to the monastery as offerings to God. Father
Ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the lamps
burning. It was said (and indeed it was true) that he ate only two
pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper, who lived close by
the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three days, and even
to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely uttered a
word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament
bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the
Father Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug
was changed every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who
came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>
prayer without looking round. If he addressed them, he was brief,
abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. On very rare occasions,
however, he would talk to visitors, but for the most part he would
utter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle, and no
entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in explanation.
He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange belief,
chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had
communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with
them, and so was silent with men.
</p>

<p>
The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by
the beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to
the corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood. <q>Maybe he will speak
as you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him,</q> the
beekeeper had warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached
in the utmost apprehension. It was rather late in the
evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the door of his cell on a
low bench. A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead. There
was an evening freshness in the air. The monk from Obdorsk bowed
down before the saint and asked his blessing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?</q> said Father
Ferapont. <q>Get up!</q>
</p>

<p>
The monk got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come
from?</q>
</p>

<p>
What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his
strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous
old man. He was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh
and healthy face. There was no doubt he still had considerable
strength. He was of athletic build. In spite of his great age he was
not even quite gray, and still had very thick hair and a full beard,
both of which had once been black. His eyes were gray, large and
luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke with a broad accent.
He was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of coarse convict
cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round his waist.
His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of the
coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been
changed for months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>
pounds under his coat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old
slippers almost dropping to pieces.
</p>

<p>
<q>From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,</q> the
monk answered humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather
frightened little eyes kept watch on the hermit.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester
well?</q>
</p>

<p>
The monk hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During
Lent there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. For Tuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed
fruit with honey, wild berries, or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout.
On Saturday white cabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha,
all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with
the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening, six whole
days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and
water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just
the same as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing
is eaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till
three o'clock, and then take a little bread and water and drink a
single cup of wine. On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have
something cooked without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as the
Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday: <q>It is unseemly
by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonor the whole
of Lent!</q> This is how we keep the fast. But what is that compared
with you, holy Father,</q> added the monk, growing more confident,
<q>for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but
bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full
seven. It's truly marvelous&mdash;your great abstinence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And mushrooms?</q> asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mushrooms?</q> repeated the surprised monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go
away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries,
but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage
to the devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of
such fasting. Haughty and unclean is their judgment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Och, true,</q> sighed the monk.
</p>

<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>

<p>
<q>And have you seen devils among them?</q> asked Ferapont.
</p>

<p>
<q>Among them? Among whom?</q> asked the monk, timidly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I
haven't been since. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding
under his cassock, only his horns poked out; another had one peeping
out of his pocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me;
another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was hanging
round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him about without
seeing him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You&mdash;can see spirits?</q> the monk inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming
out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the
door, and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick
long gray tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door
and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He
squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over
him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed spider.
He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking, but they
don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have been there.
I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,</q> said
the monk, growing bolder and bolder, <q>is it true, as they noise
abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual
communication with the Holy Ghost?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He does fly down at times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he fly down? In what form?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As a bird.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's the Holy Ghost and there's the Holy Spirit. The Holy
Spirit can appear as other birds&mdash;sometimes as a swallow, sometimes
a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue-tit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know him from an ordinary tit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he speak, in what language?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Human language.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what does he tell you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would
ask me unseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.</q>
</p>

<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>

<p>
<q>Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,</q> the
monk shook his head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened
little eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you see this tree?</q> asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do, blessed Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What sort of shape?</q> inquired the monk, after a pause of vain
expectation.
</p>

<p>
<q>It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night
it is Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those
arms, I see it clearly and tremble. It's terrible, terrible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, He'll snatch me up and carry me away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alive?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard? He will
take me in His arms and bear me away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one
of the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished
at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father
Zossima. He was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not
strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should
<q>see marvels.</q> His words seemed certainly queer, but God only
could tell what was hidden in those words, and were not worse
words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their
intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the devil's tail
he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the figurative
sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong
prejudice against the institution of <q>elders,</q> which he only knew
of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before
he had been long at the monastery, he had detected the
secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the
institution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who
poked his nose into everything. This was why the news of the
fresh <q>miracle</q> performed by Father Zossima reduced him to
extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their
inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting
to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions
among the monks that were crowding within and without the
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
elder's cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at the time,
and only recollected it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima,
feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of
Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran
at once. There was no one else in the cell but Father Païssy, Father
Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The elder, opening his weary eyes
and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Are your people expecting you, my son?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise some one yesterday
to see them to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did promise&mdash;to my father&mdash;my brothers&mdash;others too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die
without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say
that word, my son, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear
son, because you love me. But now go to keep your promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the
promise that he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be
the last gift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his
soul. He made haste that he might finish what he had to do in
the town and return quickly. Father Païssy, too, uttered some
words of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly. He
spoke as they left the cell together.
</p>

<p>
<q>Remember, young man, unceasingly,</q> Father Païssy began,
without preface, <q>that the science of this world, which has become
a great power, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything
divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel
analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was
sacred of old. But they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked
the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole
still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it
not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the
masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the souls
of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who
have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being
still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal
of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When
it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque. Remember
this especially, young man, since you are being sent into the
world by your departing elder. Maybe, remembering this great
day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the heart for your
guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the world
are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my
orphan.</q>
</p>

<p>
With these words Father Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the
monastery and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he
had met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in
this austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as
though Father Zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and
<q>perhaps that's just what had passed between them,</q> Alyosha
thought suddenly. The philosophic reflections he had just heard
so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Païssy's heart.
He was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation
and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest
defense he could imagine.

<head>Chapter II. At His Father's</head>

<p>
First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered
that his father had insisted the day before that he
should come without his brother Ivan seeing him. <q>Why so?</q> Alyosha
wondered suddenly. <q>Even if my father has something to say
to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his excitement
yesterday he meant to say something different,</q> he decided.
Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden
gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),
told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone
out two hours ago.
</p>

<p>
<q>And my father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is up, taking his coffee,</q> Marfa answered somewhat dryly.
</p>

<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>

<p>
Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table
wearing slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself
by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however.
He was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out
marketing. Though he had got up early and was trying to put a
bold face on it, he looked tired and weak. His forehead, upon which
huge purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged
with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen terribly in the
night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his
whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old man
was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he
came in.
</p>

<p>
<q>The coffee is cold,</q> he cried harshly; <q>I won't offer you any.
I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't
invite any one to share it. Why have you come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To find out how you are,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence.
You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking
in directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he
got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the
fortieth time that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his
red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,</q> he observed
sententiously. <q>Well, how are things over there? How is
your elder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is very bad; he may die to-day,</q> answered Alyosha. But
his father had not listened, and had forgotten his own question
at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's gone out,</q> he said suddenly. <q>He is doing his utmost
to carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,</q>
he added maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely he did not tell you so?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three
weeks ago? You don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you?
He must have had some object in coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? Why do you say such things?</q> said Alyosha,
troubled.
</p>

<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>

<p>
<q>He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a farthing
from me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well
know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing,
and the longer I live, the more I shall need it,</q> he continued, pacing
from one corner of the room to the other, keeping his hands in the
pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material.
<q>I can still pass for a man at five and fifty, but I want to pass for
one for another twenty years. As I get older, you know, I shan't be
a pretty object. The wenches won't come to me of their own accord,
so I shall want my money. So I am saving up more and more,
simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may as
well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell
you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others
do it on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall
upon me for being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it's not the
proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I
believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all.
You can pray for my soul if you like. And if you don't want to,
don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan talked well here
yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a conceited coxcomb,
but he has no particular learning ... nor education either. He
sits silent and smiles at one without speaking&mdash;that's what pulls him
through.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened to him in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself
airs. Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a
minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
you have only to want a thing and you can have it. That's what
Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to prevent me getting married
and that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself.
He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I should
leave him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries
Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what
he's reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better
lie down,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>There! you say that,</q> the old man observed suddenly, as though
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
it had struck him for the first time, <q>and I am not angry with you.
But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you
I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not ill-natured, but distorted,</q> said Alyosha with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked
up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course
in these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a
prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your
old father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own
house, and brag of murdering him outright&mdash;all in the presence of
witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked
up at once for what he did yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you don't mean to take proceedings?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's
another thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to see
him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old
man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to
me.... For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know
her through and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy?
Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy
into it, it's delicious, my boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may,</q> said
Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket
of his cassock. <q>And you'd better not have brandy, either,</q> he
suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing
them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.</q>
</p>

<p>
He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then
locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough. One glass won't kill me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see you are in a better humor now,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels
I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya&mdash;why is that?
He wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
are all scoundrels! But I don't recognize Ivan, I don't know him
at all. Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As
though I'd leave him anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may
as well know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles
at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on
them. And your Mitya will squelch too. <emph>Your</emph> Mitya, for you love
him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him.
But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving
him. But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like
Ivan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust.
When the wind blows, the dust will be gone.... I had a silly idea
in my head when I told you to come to-day; I wanted to find out
from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a thousand or
maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself
off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without
Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I&mdash;I'll ask him,</q> muttered Alyosha. <q>If you would give him
three thousand, perhaps he&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've
changed my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give
him anything, not a penny, I want my money myself,</q> cried the old
man, waving his hand. <q>I'll crush him like a beetle without it.
Don't say anything to him or else he will begin hoping. There's
nothing for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is that betrothed of
his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully hidden from
me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see her
yesterday, I believe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing will induce her to abandon him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and
a scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young
ladies, very different from&mdash;Ah, if I had his youth and the looks
I had then (for I was better-looking than he at eight and twenty)
I'd have been a conquering hero just as he is. He is a low cad!
But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he shan't! I'll crush him!</q>
</p>

<p>
His anger had returned with the last words.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,</q> he
snapped harshly.
</p>

<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>

<p>
Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that for?</q> The old man was a little surprised. <q>We
shall see each other again, or do you think we shan't?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all, I didn't mean anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nor did I, I did not mean anything,</q> said the old man, looking
at him. <q>Listen, listen,</q> he shouted after him, <q>make haste and
come again and I'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like
to-day. Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!</q>
</p>

<p>
And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the
cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have more!</q> he muttered, clearing his throat, and again
he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he
went into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one
minute he was asleep.

<head>Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys</head>

<p>
<q>Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,</q>
thought Alyosha, as he left his father's house and turned
towards Madame Hohlakov's, <q>or I might have to tell him of my
meeting with Grushenka yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had
renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again.
<q>Father is spiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick
to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday,
he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made
some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to-day, whatever
happens.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on
the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a
great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and
turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is
divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between
the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home
from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with
leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in
little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round
the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear.
The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently
holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been
able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although
he was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he liked
schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious as he was to-day,
he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He looked into
their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had
stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,
there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a
satchel at his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking
and with sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and
anxious watch on the other six, obviously his schoolfellows with
whom he had just come out of school, but with whom he had evidently
had a feud.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy
in a black jacket, observed:
</p>

<p>
<q>When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry
it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got
yours on your right side. So it will be awkward for you to get
at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical
remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get
at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more with a
group of children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way
so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it
by instinct.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he is left-handed,</q> another, a fine healthy-looking boy of
eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>He even throws stones with his left hand,</q> observed a third.
</p>

<p>
At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed
the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by
the boy standing the other side of the ditch.
</p>

<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>

<p>
<q>Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,</q> they all shouted. But
Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged
himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the
ground. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose
coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the
group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully
on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov,
Karamazov!</q> the boys shouted, laughing. <q>Come, all throw at him
at once!</q> and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the
head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously
returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many
of the group had their pockets full too.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one!
Why, you'll kill him,</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary
boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>He began first!</q> cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish
voice. <q>He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day
with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he
must be thrashed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what for? I suppose you tease him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,</q> cried
the children. <q>It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all
of you, at him again, don't miss, Smurov!</q> and again a fire of stones,
and a very vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch
was hit in the chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill
towards Mihailovsky Street. They all shouted: <q>Aha, he is funking,
he is running away. Wisp of tow!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too
good for him,</q> said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He
seemed to be the eldest.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's wrong with him?</q> asked Alyosha, <q>is he a tell-tale or
what?</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?</q> the same boy went
on. <q>Catch him up.... You see he's stopped again, he is waiting
and looking at you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>

<p>
<q>He is looking at you,</q> the other boys chimed in.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you
hear, ask him that!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them,
and they at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't go near him, he'll hurt you,</q> cried Smurov in a warning
voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease
him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why
you hate him so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Find out then, find out,</q> cried the boys, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence,
straight towards the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better look out,</q> the boys called after him; <q>he won't
be afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did
Krassotkin.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him,
Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an
undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes
that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby
old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms
stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right
knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a
big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the
pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha
stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The
boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him,
became less defiant, and addressed him first.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone!</q>
he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,</q> observed
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I hit Smurov on the head!</q> cried the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone
at me on purpose,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
The boy looked darkly at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know you. Do you know me?</q> Alyosha continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me alone!</q> the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive
light in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, I am going,</q> said Alyosha; <q>only I don't know you
and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I
don't want to tease you. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Monk in silk trousers!</q> cried the boy, following Alyosha with
the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself
into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would
fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked
away. He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the
boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then,
when they say that you attack on the sly,</q> said Alyosha, turning
round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into
Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the
stone struck him on the elbow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would
attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like
a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha
had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with
both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and
it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain
and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at
last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's finger had been
badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha
took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured
hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting
all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well,</q> he said, <q>you see how badly you've bitten me.
That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
The boy stared in amazement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,</q>
Alyosha went on with the same serenity, <q>yet I must have done
something to you&mdash;you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.
So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky
Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the distance
as fast as ever, not turning his head, and no doubt still keeping up
his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as soon as
he had time, and to solve this mystery. Just now he had not the
time.

<head>Chapter IV. At The Hohlakovs'</head>

<p>
Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome
stone house of two stories, one of the finest in our town.
Though Madame Hohlakov spent most of her time in another province
where she had an estate, or in Moscow, where she had a house
of her own, yet she had a house in our town too, inherited from her
forefathers. The estate in our district was the largest of her three
estates, yet she had been very little in our province before this
time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you get my letter about the new miracle?</q> She spoke rapidly
and nervously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his
mother!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is dying to-day,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or
some one, about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am
I can't see him! The whole town is in excitement, they are all
suspense. But now&mdash;do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that's lucky,</q> cried Alyosha. <q>Then I shall see her here.
She told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, I know all. I've heard exactly what happened yesterday&mdash;and
the atrocious behavior of that&mdash;creature.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est tragique</foreign>,
and if I'd been in her place I don't know what I should have done.
And your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?&mdash;my
goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am forgetting, only fancy;
your brother is in there with her, not that dreadful brother who
was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he is

sitting with her talking; they are having a serious conversation. If
you could only imagine what's passing between them now&mdash;it's
awful, I tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale of
horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.
They both recognize it and revel in it. I've been watching for you!
I've been thirsting for you! It's too much for me, that's the worst
of it. I'll tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of
something else, the most important thing&mdash;I had quite forgotten
what's most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in hysterics?
As soon as she heard you were here, she began to be hysterical!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Maman</foreign>, it's you who are
hysterical now, not I,</q> Lise's voice
caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice
sounded as though she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost
to control it. Alyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise
was peeping through it, but that he could not see.
</p>

<p>
<q>And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make
me hysterical too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has
been so ill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for
the morning and for Herzenstube to come. He says that he can
make nothing of it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes
and says that he can make nothing of it. As soon as you approached
the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and insisted on being
wheeled back into this room here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, I didn't know he had come. It wasn't on his account
I wanted to be wheeled into this room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch
was coming. She was on the look-out for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My darling mamma, it's not at all clever of you. But if you
want to make up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma,
you'd better tell our honored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he
has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened
yesterday and although every one is laughing at him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who
laughs at him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can't do
without him. Oh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!</q>
