money, and if you will have it so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing
can be more probable than that statement, and more consistent with
the temper and spirit of the prisoner. The prosecutor is charmed
with his own romance. A man of weak will, who had brought
himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his
betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it
up, but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two
days and taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a
month. All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone
that brooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened
quite differently? What if you've been weaving a romance, and
about quite a different kind of man? That's just it, you have
invented quite a different man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on
one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month
before the catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half.
But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been
shown in court already. Besides, in another man's hand a crust
always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that
money; they all judged simply at sight. And the witness Maximov
has testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his hand. You
see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two-edged weapon. Let
me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by
Katerina Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post.
<pb n='829'/><anchor id='Pg829'/>
But the question is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in
such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now?
The first statement made by the young lady on the subject was different,
perfectly different. In the second statement we heard only
cries of resentment and revenge, cries of long-concealed hatred.
And the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly,
gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of evidence
may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare
not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch
on it either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and
high-principled person, such as that highly respected young lady
unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in
court to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive
of ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given
not impartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that
a revengeful woman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may
well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult and humiliation of
her offering him the money. No, it was offered in such a way that
it was possible to take it, especially for a man so easy-going as the
prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive shortly from his father
the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was owing to him. It
was unreflecting of him, but it was just his irresponsible want of
reflection that made him so confident that his father would give him
the money, that he would get it, and so could always dispatch the
money entrusted to him and repay the debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day
have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That's
not his character, he tells us, he couldn't have had such feelings.
But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried
out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at
once. Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature, fluctuating between
two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent
craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if something
strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is love&mdash;that
new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he
needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress.
If she were to say to him, <q>I am yours, I won't have Fyodor Pavlovitch,</q>
then he must have money to take her away. That was more
<pb n='830'/><anchor id='Pg830'/>
important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand
it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from&mdash;what is
there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in
case of emergency?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner
the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that
he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner,
loved. <q>If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn't give the money,</q> he thought,
<q>I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina
Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried
round his neck, and say, <q>I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.</q>
So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that
sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he shouldn't unpick the
little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why should you
deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of honor,
granted that it's misplaced, granted it's often mistaken, yet it exists
and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments
reach a climax, and those same two questions torture his
fevered brain more and more: <q>If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where
can I find the means to go off with Grushenka?</q> If he behaved
wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the taverns in the course
of that month, it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained
beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions became so
acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his younger
brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles, but
without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating
the old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect
of getting it from any one; his father would not give it him
after that beating.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the
upper part of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his
brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still
he would remain a scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use
that means, that he wouldn't have the character, that he wouldn't
have the will-power to do it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse
to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so genuinely
<pb n='831'/><anchor id='Pg831'/>
and sincerely, so spontaneously and convincingly? And why, on the
contrary, does he force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice,
in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner
wrote that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous
proof of the prisoner having committed robbery! <q>I shall
beg from every one, and if I don't get it I shall murder my father
and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under
his mattress as soon as Ivan has gone.</q> A full program of the murder,
we are told, so it must have been he. <q>It has all been done as he
wrote,</q> cries the prosecutor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and written
in great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from
what he has heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the
envelope himself; and thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you
prove that he did it? Did the prisoner take the envelope from under
the pillow, did he find the money, did that money exist indeed?
And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off, if you remember?
He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out where she was,
the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry out
a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act
of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a
jealous fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered
him he seized the money, too. But did he murder him after
all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man
cannot be accused of robbery, if it's impossible to state accurately
what he has stolen; that's an axiom. But did he murder him without
robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved? Isn't that,
too, a romance?</q>

<head>Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either</head>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a
man's life is at stake and that you must be careful. We have
heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to-day he hesitated to
<pb n='832'/><anchor id='Pg832'/>
accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the
crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was
produced in court to-day. <q>All was done as written.</q> But, I repeat
again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely to find out where
she was. That's a fact that can't be disputed. Had she been at
home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at
her side, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter.
He ran unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very
likely he did not even remember his drunken letter. <q>He snatched
up the pestle,</q> they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice
of psychology was built on that pestle&mdash;why he was bound to look
at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on. A
very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that
pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from
which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away
in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner's eye, and he
would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and
then he would certainly not have killed any one. How then can I
look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and
two days before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter,
he was quiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because
a Karamazov could not help quarreling, forsooth! But my
answer to that is, that, if he was planning such a murder in accordance
with his letter, he certainly would not have quarreled even with
a shopman, and probably would not have gone into the tavern at
all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement,
seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard, and that
not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,
the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can
use it. As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month,
don't we often hear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns
shout, <q>I'll kill you</q>? but they don't murder any one. And that
fatal letter&mdash;isn't that simply drunken irritability, too? Isn't that
simply the shout of the brawler outside the tavern, <q>I'll kill you!
I'll kill the lot of you!</q> Why not, why could it not be that? What
reason have we to call that letter <q>fatal</q> rather than absurd? Because
his father has been found murdered, because a witness saw the
<pb n='833'/><anchor id='Pg833'/>
prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his hand, and
was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything was
done as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not <q>absurd,</q>
but <q>fatal.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now, thank God! we've come to the real point: <q>since he was
in the garden, he must have murdered him.</q> In those few words:
<q>since he <emph>was</emph>, then he <emph>must</emph></q> lies the whole case for the
prosecution. He was there, so he must have. And what if there is no <emph>must</emph>
about it, even if he was there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence&mdash;the
coincidences&mdash;are really suggestive. But examine all these facts
separately, regardless of their connection. Why, for instance, does
the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner's statement
that he ran away from his father's window? Remember the
sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the
respectful and <q>pious</q> sentiments which suddenly came over the murderer.
But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of
religious awe, if not of filial respect? <q>My mother must have been
praying for me at that moment,</q> were the prisoner's words at the
preliminary inquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced
himself that Madame Svyetlov was not in his father's house. <q>But
he could not convince himself by looking through the window,</q>
the prosecutor objects. But why couldn't he? Why? The window
opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some word might have
been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which showed
the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume everything
as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A
thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest
imagination.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly
was in the house, therefore he killed him.</q> Now about that
door, gentlemen of the jury.... Observe that we have only the
statement of one witness as to that door, and he was at the time
in such a condition, that&mdash; But supposing the door was open; supposing
the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an instinct of self-defense,
natural in his position; supposing he did go into the house&mdash;well,
what then? How does it follow that because he was there he
committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through the
rooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him;
<pb n='834'/><anchor id='Pg834'/>
but as soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he
may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had
not killed his father. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped
from the temptation to kill his father, because he had a clear conscience
and was rejoicing at not having killed him, that he was
capable of a pure feeling, the feeling of pity and compassion, and
leapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of Grigory after
he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the
dreadful state of the prisoner's mind at Mokroe when love again lay
before him calling him to new life, while love was impossible for
him because he had his father's bloodstained corpse behind him and
beyond that corpse&mdash;retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed
him love, which he explained, according to his method, talking
about his drunken condition, about a criminal being taken to execution,
about it being still far off, and so on and so on. But again I
ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not invented a new personality? Is
the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment
of love and of dodges to escape punishment, if his hands were
really stained with his father's blood? No, no, no! As soon as it
was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her
side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must have
felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed
himself, if he had his father's murder on his conscience. Oh, no!
he would not have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the
prisoner: the savage, stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor
is inconsistent with his character. He would have killed
himself, that's certain. He did not kill himself just because <q>his
mother's prayers had saved him,</q> and he was innocent of his father's
blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that night at Mokroe only
about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man would recover,
that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not have
to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?
What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But we shall be told at once again, <q>There is his father's corpse!
If he ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?</q>
Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who
murdered him, if not he? There's no one to put in his place.</q>
</p>

<pb n='835'/><anchor id='Pg835'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually
true that there is no one else at all? We've heard the prosecutor
count on his fingers all the persons who were in that house that
night. They were five in number; three of them, I agree, could not
have been responsible&mdash;the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and
his wife. There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the
prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov
because he had no one else to fix on, that had there been a
sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would have abandoned
the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have
accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not
draw the very opposite conclusion? There are two persons&mdash;the
prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my
client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And you
have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov
from all suspicion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It's true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his
two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who
accuse him: there are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion,
an obscure report, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence
of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit,
inconclusive. In the first place we have precisely on the day of the
catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor,
for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful defense. Then
Smerdyakov's sudden suicide on the eve of the trial. Then the
equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the elder of the
prisoner's brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has to-day
produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer.
Oh, I fully share the court's and the prosecutor's conviction
that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement
may really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save
his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man. But again
Smerdyakov's name is pronounced, again there is a suggestion of
mystery. There is something unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps
it may one day be explained. But we won't go into that now.
Of that later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime,
I might make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov
<pb n='836'/><anchor id='Pg836'/>
drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while
I admire his talent I cannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov,
I have seen him and talked to him, and he made a very different
impression on me. He was weak in health, it is true; but in
character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor
has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the timidity
on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity about
him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme mistrustfulness
concealed under a mask of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïveté</foreign>,
and an intelligence of
considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him
for weak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left
him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature,
excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made
some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and
would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of
<q>stinking Lizaveta.</q> He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory
and his wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed
and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming
a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn't the means
to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely
high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to
good clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself
to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence
of this), he might well have resented his position, compared
with that of his master's legitimate sons. They had everything, he
nothing. They had all the rights, they had the inheritance, while
he was only the cook. He told me himself that he had helped Fyodor
Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The destination of
that sum&mdash;a sum which would have made his career&mdash;must have
been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in
new rainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.)
Oh, beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of
money at once! And it was the first time he had seen so much
money in the hands of one man. The sight of the rainbow-colored
notes may have made a morbid impression on his imagination, but
with no immediate results.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched
for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov's
<pb n='837'/><anchor id='Pg837'/>
guilt, and asked us in particular what motive he had in
feigning a fit. But he may not have been feigning at all, the fit
may have happened quite naturally, but it may have passed off
quite naturally, and the sick man may have recovered, not completely
perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as happens with
epileptics.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have
committed the murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment.
He might have waked up from deep sleep (for he was only
asleep&mdash;an epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep) at that
moment when the old Grigory shouted at the top of his voice <q>Parricide!</q>
That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov
whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment: he
might naturally have waked up an hour before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no
definite motive towards the sound to see what's the matter. His
head is still clouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep;
but, once in the garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he
hears terrible news from his master, who would be, of course, glad
to see him. His mind sets to work at once. He hears all the details
from his frightened master, and gradually in his disordered brain
there shapes itself an idea&mdash;terrible, but seductive and irresistibly
logical. To kill the old man, take the three thousand, and throw
all the blame on to his young master. A terrible lust of money,
of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security from detection.
Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often
when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers
who have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And
Smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his plan. With what
weapon? Why, with any stone picked up in the garden. But what
for, with what object? Why, the three thousand which means a
career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting myself&mdash;the money
may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to
find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money&mdash;the
torn envelope on the floor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory
that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the
envelope on the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would
have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as
<pb n='838'/><anchor id='Pg838'/>
I listened that I was hearing something very familiar, and, would
you believe it, I have heard that very argument, that very conjecture,
of how Karamazov would have behaved, precisely two days
before, from Smerdyakov himself. What's more, it struck me at the
time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him;
that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy
it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate
the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented
prosecutor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be asked, <q>What about the old woman, Grigory's wife?
She heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.</q> Yes, she heard
it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who
complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a
dog in the yard. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped
once or twice in the night. And that's natural. If any one is
asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but
instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a groan, he
wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two
hours later&mdash;three times altogether in the night. Next morning
the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning
all night and keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to
him: the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember, he
only remembers the moments of waking, so he feels he has been
waked up all night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess
in his last letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step
and not to both? But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and
the suicide may not have felt penitence, but only despair. Despair
and penitence are two very different things. Despair may be vindictive
and irreconcilable, and the suicide, laying his hands on himself,
may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had
envied all his life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice!
What is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find
the error in my reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And
if there is but a shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my
propositions, do not condemn him. And is there only a shade? I
swear by all that is sacred, I fully believe in the explanation of the
murder I have just put forward. What troubles me and makes me
<pb n='839'/><anchor id='Pg839'/>
indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution
against the prisoner, there is not a single one certain and
irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation
of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the
blood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt,
the dark night resounding with the shout <q>Parricide!</q> and the old
man falling with a broken head. And then the mass of phrases,
statements, gestures, shouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can
so bias the mind; but, gentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds?
Remember, you have been given absolute power to bind and to
loose, but the greater the power, the more terrible its responsibility.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now,
but suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my
luckless client had stained his hands with his father's blood. This
is only hypothesis, I repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his
innocence. But, so be it, I assume that my client is guilty of
parricide. Even so, hear what I have to say. I have it in my heart
to say something more to you, for I feel that there must be a great
conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive my referring to
your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to be
truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause.
The last words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity
that every one felt that he really might have something to
say, and that what he was about to say would be of the greatest
consequence. But the President, hearing the applause, in a loud
voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were repeated.
Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch began in a voice full of
feeling quite unlike the tone he had used hitherto.

<head>Chapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought</head>

<p>
<q>It's not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client
with ruin, gentlemen of the jury,</q> he began, <q rend='pre'>what is really
damning for my client is one fact&mdash;the dead body of his father.
<pb n='840'/><anchor id='Pg840'/>
Had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the
charge in view of the triviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic
character of the evidence, if you examine each part of it
separately; or, at least, you would have hesitated to ruin a man's
life simply from the prejudice against him which he has, alas! only
too well deserved. But it's not an ordinary case of murder, it's a
case of parricide. That impresses men's minds, and to such a degree
that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes
less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind. How
can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he committed the murder
and gets off unpunished? That is what every one, almost involuntarily,
instinctively, feels at heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, it's a fearful thing to shed a father's blood&mdash;the father who
has begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over
my illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness,
and has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a
father&mdash;that's inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a
father&mdash;a real father? What is the meaning of that great word?
What is the great idea in that name? We have just indicated in
part what a true father is and what he ought to be. In the case
in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts
are aching&mdash;in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov,
did not correspond to that conception of a father to which
we have just referred. That's the misfortune. And indeed some
fathers are a misfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather
more closely: we must shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury,
considering the importance of the decision you have to make. It's
our particular duty not to shrink from any idea, like children or
frightened women, as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent
(and he was my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several
times, <q>Oh, I will not yield the defense of the prisoner to the
lawyer who has come down from Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend
also!</q> He exclaimed that several times, but forgot to mention
that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three years so grateful
for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who had been
kind to him, as a child in his father's house, might not such a man
well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his
<pb n='841'/><anchor id='Pg841'/>
father's back-yard, <q>without boots on his feet and with his little
trousers hanging by one button</q>&mdash;to use the expression of the kind-hearted
doctor, Herzenstube?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at
this misfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did
my client meet with when he arrived here, at his father's house, and
why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled,
he is wild and unruly&mdash;we are trying him now for that&mdash;but
who is responsible for his life? Who is responsible for his
having received such an unseemly bringing up, in spite of his excellent
disposition and his grateful and sensitive heart? Did any one
train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by study? Did any
one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was left to
the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted perhaps
to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand
times perhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away
the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with
all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to forgive his
father! And what awaited him? He was met by cynical taunts,
suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard nothing but revolting
talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy, and
at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with his own
money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!
And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and
cruelty of his son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated
him, bought up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into
prison.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce,
unruly, and uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently
indeed, exceedingly tender-hearted, only they don't express
it. Don't laugh, don't laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor
laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving Schiller&mdash;loving
the sublime and beautiful! I should not have laughed at that
in his place. Yes, such natures&mdash;oh, let me speak in defense of such
natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood&mdash;these natures often
thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in contrast to
themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity&mdash;they thirst for it unconsciously.
Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully
<pb n='842'/><anchor id='Pg842'/>
capable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated
love. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in
such natures. But they cannot hide their passions&mdash;sometimes very
coarse&mdash;and that is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is
unseen. Their passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a
noble and lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks
a new life, seeks to correct himself, to be better, to become noble
and honorable, <q>sublime and beautiful,</q> however much the expression
has been ridiculed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client's
engagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard
just now was not evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and
revengeful woman, and it was not for her&mdash;oh, not for her!&mdash;to
reproach him with treachery, for she has betrayed him! If she had
had but a little time for reflection she would not have given such
evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client is not a monster,
as she called him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: <q>I
am the Good Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for
his sheep, so that not one of them might be lost.</q> Let not a man's
soul be lost through us!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I asked just now what does <q>father</q> mean, and exclaimed that it
was a great word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly,
gentlemen, and I venture to call things by their right names:
such a father as old Karamazov cannot be called a father and does
not deserve to be. Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity,
an impossibility. Love cannot be created from nothing: only God
can create something from nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,</q> the apostle writes,
from a heart glowing with love. It's not for the sake of my client
that I quote these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers.
Who has authorized me to preach to fathers? No one. But as a
man and a citizen I make my appeal&mdash;<foreign rend='italic'>vivos
voco!</foreign> We are not long
on earth, we do many evil deeds and say many evil words. So let us
all catch a favorable moment when we are all together to say a
good word to each other. That's what I am doing: while I am in
this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for nothing is
this tribune given us by the highest authority&mdash;all Russia hears us!
<pb n='843'/><anchor id='Pg843'/>
I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud
to all fathers: <q>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.</q> Yes,
let us first fulfill Christ's injunction ourselves and only then venture
to expect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but
enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies,
and we have made them our enemies ourselves. <q>What measure
ye mete it shall be measured unto you again</q>&mdash;it's not I who say that,
it's the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they measure
to you. How can we blame children if they measure us according
to our measure?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having
secretly given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of
which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft,
behind some bricks. It was opened and inside was found the body
of a new-born child which she had killed. In the same box were
found the skeletons of two other babies which, according to her own
confession, she had killed at the moment of their birth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She
gave birth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would
any one venture to give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be
bold, gentlemen, let us be audacious even: it's our duty to be so at
this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like
the Moscow women in Ostrovsky's play, who are scared at the sound
of certain words. No, let us prove that the progress of the last few
years has touched even us, and let us say plainly, the father is not
merely he who begets the child, but he who begets it and does his
duty by it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other interpretation
of the word <q>father,</q> which insists that any father, even
though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children,
still remains my father simply because he begot me. But this
is, so to say, the mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend
with my intellect, but can only accept by faith, or, better to say,
<emph>on faith</emph>, like many other things which I do not understand, but
which religion bids me believe. But in that case let it be kept outside
the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of actual life, which
has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us great duties and
obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be humane&mdash;Christian, in
<pb n='844'/><anchor id='Pg844'/>
fact&mdash;we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions justified by
reason and experience, which have been passed through the crucible
of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though in
dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not
ill-treat and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not
only mystic, but rational and philanthropic....</q>
</p>

<p>
There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of
the court, but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring
them to let him finish without interruption. The court relapsed
into silence at once. The orator went on.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up
and begin to reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot,
and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction. The
sight of an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting
questions to a young creature, especially when he compares him with
the excellent fathers of his companions. The conventional answer
to this question is: <q>He begot you, and you are his flesh and blood,
and therefore you are bound to love him.</q> The youth involuntarily
reflects: <q>But did he love me when he begot me?</q> he asks, wondering
more and more. <q>Was it for my sake he begot me? He did not
know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,
perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me
a propensity to drunkenness&mdash;that's all he's done for me.... Why
am I bound to love him simply for begetting me when he has cared
nothing for me all my life after?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but
do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. <q>Drive
nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window,</q> and, above
all, let us not be afraid of words, but decide the question according
to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas.
How shall it be decided? Why, like this. Let the son stand before
his father and ask him, <q>Father, tell me, why must I love you?
Father, show me that I must love you,</q> and if that father is able
to answer him and show him good reason, we have a real, normal,
parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on a rational,
responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he does
not, there's an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him,
and the son has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even
<pb n='845'/><anchor id='Pg845'/>
an enemy. Our tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a
school of true and sound ideas.</q>
</p>

<p>
(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost
frantic applause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a
good half of it applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded.
Shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery,
where the ladies were sitting. Handkerchiefs were waved. The
President began ringing his bell with all his might. He was obviously
irritated by the behavior of the audience, but did not venture
to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of high position,
old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially reserved
seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their handkerchiefs.
So that when the noise died down, the President confined
himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and Fetyukovitch,
excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which
so much has been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and
stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten
him. I insist most emphatically it was not for money he ran to
his father's house: the charge of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved
before. And it was not to murder him he broke into the house,
oh, no! If he had had that design he would, at least, have taken
the precaution of arming himself beforehand. The brass pestle he
caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it. Granted
that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that
he made his way in&mdash;I've said already that I do not for a moment
believe that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment.
Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that's holy, if it had not been his
father, but an ordinary enemy, he would, after running through the
rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there, have
made off, post-haste, without doing any harm to his rival. He would
have struck him, pushed him away perhaps, nothing more, for he
had no thought and no time to spare for that. What he wanted
to know was where she was. But his father, his father! The mere
sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood, had been
his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was enough!
A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly, clouding
his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse
<pb n='846'/><anchor id='Pg846'/>
of madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly
and unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging
the violation of its eternal laws.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But the prisoner even then did not murder him&mdash;I maintain
that, I cry that aloud!&mdash;no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst
of indignant disgust, not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he
would kill him. Had he not had this fatal pestle in his hand, he
would have only knocked his father down perhaps, but would not
have killed him. As he ran away, he did not know whether he had
killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder
is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be
called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide
by prejudice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul;
did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we
convict and punish him, he will say to himself: <q>These people
have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing
to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me
a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have
not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me
to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe
no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked.
They are cruel and I will be cruel.</q> That is what he will say, gentlemen
of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will
only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will
curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it. At the same
time you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man,
for he will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most
awful punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to
save him and regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your
mercy! You will see, you will hear how he will tremble and be
horror-struck. <q>How can I endure this mercy? How can I endure
so much love? Am I worthy of it?</q> That's what he will exclaim.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart,
gentlemen of the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts
for a great and loving action, it will melt and mount upwards.
There are souls which, in their limitation, blame the whole world.
<pb n='847'/><anchor id='Pg847'/>
But subdue such a soul with mercy, show it love, and it will curse
its past, for there are many good impulses in it. Such a heart will
expand and see that God is merciful and that men are good and
just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse and
the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say
then, <q>I am quits,</q> but will say, <q>I am guilty in the sight of all men
and am more unworthy than all.</q> With tears of penitence and
poignant, tender anguish, he will exclaim: <q>Others are better than
I, they wanted to save me, not to ruin me!</q> Oh, this act of mercy
is so easy for you, for in the absence of anything like real evidence
it will be too awful for you to pronounce: <q>Yes, he is guilty.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man!
Do you hear, do you hear that majestic voice from the past century
of our glorious history? It is not for an insignificant person like
me to remind you that the Russian court does not exist for the punishment
only, but also for the salvation of the criminal! Let other
nations think of retribution and the letter of the law, we will cling
to the spirit and the meaning&mdash;the salvation and the reformation
of the lost. If this is true, if Russia and her justice are such, she
may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to scare us with your
frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside in disgust.
Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia will move
calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of my
client, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice. You will defend
it, you will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch
over it, that it is in good hands!</q>

<head>Chapter XIV. The Peasants Stand Firm</head>

<p>
This was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm
of the audience burst like an irresistible storm. It was
out of the question to stop it: the women wept, many of the men
wept too, even two important personages shed tears. The President
submitted, and even postponed ringing his bell. The suppression of
such an enthusiasm would be the suppression of something sacred,
<pb n='848'/><anchor id='Pg848'/>
as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself was genuinely
touched.
</p>

<p>
And it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to
make certain objections. People looked at him with hatred. <q>What?
What's the meaning of it? He positively dares to make objections,</q>
the ladies babbled. But if the whole world of ladies, including
his wife, had protested he could not have been stopped at that
moment. He was pale, he was shaking with emotion, his first
phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath, could hardly
speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered himself. Of
this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But
what is this defense if not one romance on the top of another? All
that was lacking was poetry. Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for
his mistress, tears open the envelope and throws it on the floor. We
are even told what he said while engaged in this strange act. Is
not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we that he had
taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded
idiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society
for his illegitimate birth&mdash;isn't this a romance in the Byronic
style? And the son who breaks into his father's house and murders
him without murdering him is not even a romance&mdash;this is a sphinx
setting us a riddle which he cannot solve himself. If he murdered
him, he murdered him, and what's the meaning of his murdering
him without having murdered him&mdash;who can make head or tail of
this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true
and sound ideas and from this tribune of <q>sound ideas</q> is heard a
solemn declaration that to call the murder of a father <q>parricide</q> is
nothing but a prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every
child is to ask his father why he is to love him, what will become
of us? What will become of the foundations of society? What will
become of the family? Parricide, it appears, is only a bogy of Moscow
merchants' wives. The most precious, the most sacred guarantees
for the destiny and future of Russian justice are presented to us
in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an object&mdash;to obtain
the justification of something which cannot be justified. <q>Oh,
crush him by mercy,</q> cries the counsel for the defense; but that's all
<pb n='849'/><anchor id='Pg849'/>
the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is
crushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking
only for the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity
in the honor of the parricide to commemorate his exploit among
future generations? Religion and the Gospel are corrected&mdash;that's
all mysticism, we are told, and ours is the only true Christianity
which has been subjected to the analysis of reason and common
sense. And so they set up before us a false semblance of Christ!
<q>What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you again,</q> cried
the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that Christ teaches
us to measure as it is measured to us&mdash;and this from the tribune of
truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve
of making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance
with what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which
may be of use to produce a certain effect&mdash;all to serve the purpose!
But what Christ commands us is something very different: He bids
us beware of doing this, because the wicked world does this, but we
ought to forgive and to turn the other cheek, and not to measure
to our persecutors as they measure to us. This is what our God has
taught us and not that to forbid children to murder their fathers
is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of truth and good
sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for the
defense deigns to call only <q>the crucified lover of humanity,</q> in opposition
to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, <q>For Thou art
our God!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
At this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous
speaker, begging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds,
and so on, as presidents always do in such cases. The audience, too,
was uneasy. The public was restless: there were even exclamations
of indignation. Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only
mounted the tribune to lay his hand on his heart and, with an
offended voice, utter a few words full of dignity. He only touched
again, lightly and ironically, on <q>romancing</q> and <q>psychology,</q>
and in an appropriate place quoted, <q>Jupiter, you are angry, therefore
you are wrong,</q> which provoked a burst of approving laughter
in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like Jupiter.
Then, <foreign rend='italic'>à propos</foreign> of
the accusation that he was teaching the young
generation to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with
<pb n='850'/><anchor id='Pg850'/>
great dignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutor's
charge of uttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch
hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he had expected
in this court to be secure from accusations <q>damaging to
my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.</q> But at these words
the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch concluded his
speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court. And
Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, <q>crushed for
good.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said
very little. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally.
The look of strength and independence with which he had entered
in the morning had almost disappeared. He seemed as though he
had passed through an experience that day, which had taught him
for the rest of his life something very important he had not understood
till then. His voice was weak, he did not shout as before.
In his words there was a new note of humility, defeat and submission.
</p>

<p>
<q>What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment
has come for me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end
has come to an erring man! But, before God, I repeat to you, I am
innocent of my father's blood! For the last time I repeat, it wasn't
I killed him! I was erring, but I loved what is good. Every instant
I strove to reform, but I lived like a wild beast. I thank the
prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I did not
know; but it's not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is
mistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but
it's not true that I killed my father, and he needn't have supposed
it. And don't believe the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my
heart is heavy. If you spare me, if you let me go, I will pray for
you. I will be a better man. I give you my word before God I
will! And if you will condemn me, I'll break my sword over my
head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob me of my
God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen ...
spare me!</q>
</p>

<p>
He almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly
articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the
questions and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.
</p>

<pb n='851'/><anchor id='Pg851'/>

<p>
But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire
for consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last
charge to the jury was rather feeble. <q>Be impartial, don't be influenced
by the eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments.
Remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you,</q>
and so on and so on.
</p>

<p>
The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get
up, move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh
themselves at the buffet. It was very late, almost one o'clock in
the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no
one could think of repose. All waited with sinking hearts; though
that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a state
of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled. An
acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves
for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must own
there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an
acquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while
some were simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch
himself was confident of his success. He was surrounded
by people congratulating him and fawning upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are,</q> he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, <q>there
are invisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the
jury. One feels during one's speech if they are being formed. I
was aware of them. They exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind
at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What will our peasants say now?</q> said one stout, cross-looking,
pock-marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching
a group of gentlemen engaged in conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks
among them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there are clerks,</q> said a member of the district council,
joining the group.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal,
a juryman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a man with brains.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But he never speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is no great talker, but so much the better. There's no need
<pb n='852'/><anchor id='Pg852'/>
for the Petersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg
himself. He's the father of twelve children. Think of that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word, you don't suppose they won't acquit him?</q>
one of our young officials exclaimed in another group.
</p>

<p>
<q>They'll acquit him for certain,</q> said a resolute voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!</q> cried the
official. <q>Suppose he did murder him&mdash;there are fathers and fathers!
And, besides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have
done nothing but swing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old
man down. But it was a pity they dragged the valet in. That was
simply an absurd theory! If I'd been in Fetyukovitch's place, I
should simply have said straight out: <q>He murdered him; but he is
not guilty, hang it all!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what he did, only without saying, <q>Hang it all!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,</q> put in a
third voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town
who had cut the throat of her lover's lawful wife.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That makes no difference. She began cutting it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid,
wasn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Splendid!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And about mysticism, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, drop mysticism, do!</q> cried some one else; <q>think of Ippolit
and his fate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes
out to-morrow for Mitya's sake.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is she here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What an idea! If she'd been here she'd have scratched them out
in court. She is at home with toothache. He he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
In a third group:
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should not be surprised if he turns the <q>Metropolis</q> upside down
to-morrow. He will be drinking for ten days!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, the devil!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil's bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if
not here?</q>
</p>

<pb n='853'/><anchor id='Pg853'/>

<p>
<q>Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it's not the
thing to break your father's head with a pestle! Or what are we
coming to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his
purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice
to be had in Russia?</q>
</p>

<p>
But the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour,
neither more nor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as
soon as the public had taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen
walked into the court. At last! I won't repeat the questions
in order, and, indeed, I have forgotten them. I remember only the
answer to the President's first and chief question: <q>Did the prisoner
commit the murder for the sake of robbery and with premeditation?</q>
(I don't remember the exact words.) There was a complete
hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,
pronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of
the court:
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, guilty!</q>
</p>

<p>
And the same answer was repeated to every question: <q>Yes,
guilty!</q> and without the slightest extenuating comment. This no
one had expected; almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation
to mercy, at least. The deathlike silence in the court
was not broken&mdash;all seemed petrified: those who desired his conviction
as well as those who had been eager for his acquittal. But that
was only for the first instant, and it was followed by a fearful
hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were pleased. Some
were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their joy.
Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged
their shoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this.
But how shall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought
they would create a riot. At first they could scarcely believe their
ears. Then suddenly the whole court rang with exclamations:
<q>What's the meaning of it? What next?</q> They leapt up from
their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be at once reconsidered
and reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up
<pb n='854'/><anchor id='Pg854'/>
and cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his hands out before
him:
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not
guilty of my father's blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers,
friends, have pity on the other woman!</q>
</p>

<p>
He could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that
was heard all over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his
own. From the farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a
piercing shriek&mdash;it was Grushenka. She had succeeded in begging
admittance to the court again before the beginning of the lawyers'
speeches. Mitya was taken away. The passing of the sentence was
deferred till next day. The whole court was in a hubbub but I did
not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I heard on
the steps as I went out.
</p>

<p>
<q>He'll have a twenty years' trip to the mines!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not less.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, our peasants have stood firm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And have done for our Mitya.</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter I. Plans For Mitya's Escape</head>

<p>
Very early, at nine o'clock in the morning, five days after the
trial, Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna's to talk over a matter
of great importance to both of them, and to give her a message.
She sat and talked to him in the very room in which she had once
received Grushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious
in a high fever. Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after
the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be
carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable gossip and general
disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who lived with
her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court,
the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna
would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on
nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky
and Herzenstube were attending him. The famous doctor had gone
back to Moscow, refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end
of the illness. Though the doctors encouraged Katerina Ivanovna
and Alyosha, it was evident that they could not yet give them
positive hopes of recovery.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time
he had specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it
would be to approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He
had another engagement that could not be put off for that same
morning, and there was need of haste.
</p>

<p>
They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna
was pale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state
of hysterical excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why
Alyosha had come to her.
</p>

<pb n='856'/><anchor id='Pg856'/>

<p>
<q>Don't worry about his decision,</q> she said, with confident emphasis
to Alyosha. <q>One way or another he is bound to come to it.
He must escape. That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle&mdash;not
he, not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the
other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his brother,</q>
Katya added, with flashing eyes&mdash;<q>told me the whole plan of escape
long ago. You know he has already entered into negotiations....
I've told you something already.... You see, it will probably come
off at the third <foreign rend='italic'>étape</foreign> from
here, when the party of prisoners is being
taken to Siberia. Oh, it's a long way off yet. Ivan Fyodorovitch has
already visited the superintendent of the third <foreign rend='italic'>étape</foreign>.
But we don't know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it's impossible
to find that out so long beforehand. To-morrow perhaps I will
show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me
on the eve of the trial in case of need.... That was when&mdash;do
you remember?&mdash;you found us quarreling. He had just gone down-stairs,
but seeing you I made him come back; do you remember?
Do you know what we were quarreling about then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape.
He had told me the main idea three days before, and we began
quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled
because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were
convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious
at once&mdash;I can't tell you why, I don't know myself why.... Oh,
of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she, too,
should go abroad with Dmitri!</q> Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly,
her lips quivering with anger. <q>As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch
saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I
was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how
our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could
not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think that such a man
could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had
told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I loved no one
but him! It was only resentment against that creature that made
me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you came,
he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if
anything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me
<pb n='857'/><anchor id='Pg857'/>
that the envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he
died or was taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone. Then
he left me money, nearly ten thousand&mdash;those notes to which the
prosecutor referred in his speech, having learnt from some one that
he had sent them to be changed. I was tremendously impressed to
find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up his idea of saving his
brother, and was confiding this plan of escape to me, though he was
still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved Mitya. Oh, that
was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatness of such
self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I wanted to fall at his feet in
reverence, but I thought at once that he would take it only for
my joy at the thought of Mitya's being saved (and he certainly
would have imagined that!), and I was so exasperated at the mere
possibility of such an unjust thought on his part that I lost my
temper again, and instead of kissing his feet, flew into a fury again!
Oh, I am unhappy! It's my character, my awful, unhappy character!
Oh, you will see, I shall end by driving him, too, to abandon
me for another with whom he can get on better, like Dmitri. But ... no,
I could not bear it, I should kill myself. And when you
came in then, and when I called to you and told him to come back,
I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred he turned on
me that&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;I cried out to you that it was he, he
alone who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer!
I said that malicious thing on purpose to wound him again.
He had never, never persuaded me that his brother was a murderer.
On the contrary, it was I who persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper
was the cause of everything! I paved the way to that hideous scene
at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man,
and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for
revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause
of it all, I alone am to blame!</q>
</p>

<p>
Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and
he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when
even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished
by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her
present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him
during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some
reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak
<pb n='858'/><anchor id='Pg858'/>
to him now about that. She was suffering for her <q>treachery</q> at
the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to
confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical
writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and longed
to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even
more difficult. He spoke of Mitya again.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all right, it's all right, don't be anxious about him!</q> she
began again, sharply and stubbornly. <q>All that is only momentary,
I know him, I know his heart only too well. You may be sure he
will consent to escape. It's not as though it would be immediately;
he will have time to make up his mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will
be well by that time and will manage it all himself, so that I shall
have nothing to do with it. Don't be anxious; he will consent to
run away. He has agreed already: do you suppose he would give up
that creature? And they won't let her go to him, so he is bound to
escape. It's you he's most afraid of, he is afraid you won't approve
of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generously <emph>allow</emph> it,
if your sanction is so necessary,</q> Katya added viciously. She
paused and smiled.
</p>

<p>
<q>He talks about some hymn,</q> she went on again, <q>some cross he
has to bear, some duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a
great deal about it, and if you knew how he talked!</q> Katya cried
suddenly, with feeling she could not repress, <q>if you knew how
he loved that wretched man at the moment he told me, and how he
hated him, perhaps, at the same moment. And I heard his story
and his tears with sneering disdain. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I
am responsible for his fever. But that man in prison is incapable of
suffering,</q> Katya concluded irritably. <q>Can such a man suffer?
Men like him never suffer!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her
words. And yet it was she who had betrayed him. <q>Perhaps because
she feels how she's wronged him she hates him at moments,</q> Alyosha
thought to himself. He hoped that it was only <q>at moments.</q> In
Katya's last words he detected a challenging note, but he did not
take it up.
</p>

<p>
<q>I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade
him yourself. Or do you, too, consider that to escape would be dishonorable,
<pb n='859'/><anchor id='Pg859'/>
cowardly, or something ... unchristian, perhaps?</q>
Katya added, even more defiantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no. I'll tell him everything,</q> muttered Alyosha. <q>He asks
you to come and see him to-day,</q> he blurted out suddenly, looking
her steadily in the face. She started, and drew back a little from
him on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
<q>Me? Can that be?</q> she faltered, turning pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>It can and ought to be!</q> Alyosha began emphatically, growing
more animated. <q>He needs you particularly just now. I would
not have opened the subject and worried you, if it were not necessary.
He is ill, he is beside himself, he keeps asking for you. It is
not to be reconciled with you that he wants you, but only that you
would go and show yourself at his door. So much has happened to
him since that day. He realizes that he has injured you beyond all
reckoning. He does not ask your forgiveness&mdash;<q>It's impossible to
forgive me,</q> he says himself&mdash;but only that you would show yourself
in his doorway.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's so sudden....</q> faltered Katya. <q>I've had a presentiment
all these days that you would come with that message. I knew he
would ask me to come. It's impossible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realizes for the
first time how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had
never grasped it before so fully. He said, <q>If she refuses to come I
shall be unhappy all my life.</q> Do you hear? though he is condemned
to penal servitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happy&mdash;is
not that piteous? Think&mdash;you must visit him; though he is
ruined, he is innocent,</q> broke like a challenge from Alyosha. <q>His
hands are clean, there is no blood on them! For the sake of his
infinite sufferings in the future visit him now. Go, greet him on
his way into the darkness&mdash;stand at his door, that is all.... You
ought to do it, you ought to!</q> Alyosha concluded, laying immense
stress on the word <q>ought.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I ought to ... but I cannot....</q> Katya moaned. <q>He will
look at me.... I can't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you
don't make up your mind to do it now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Better suffer all my life.</q>
</p>

<pb n='860'/><anchor id='Pg860'/>

<p>
<q>You ought to go, you ought to go,</q> Alyosha repeated with
merciless emphasis.
</p>

<p>
<q>But why to-day, why at once?... I can't leave our patient&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don't
come, he will be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a lie;
have pity on him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have pity on <emph>me!</emph></q> Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she
burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you will come,</q> said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. <q>I'll
go and tell him you will come directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, don't tell him so on any account,</q> cried Katya in alarm.
<q>I will come, but don't tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go,
but not go in.... I don't know yet&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
Her voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up
to go.
</p>

<p>
<q>And what if I meet any one?</q> she said suddenly, in a low voice,
turning white again.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one.
There will be no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will
expect you,</q> he concluded emphatically, and went out of the room.

<head>Chapter II. For A Moment The Lie Becomes Truth</head>

<p>
He hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The
day after his fate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with
nervous fever, and was sent to the prison division of the town
hospital. But at the request of several persons (Alyosha, Madame
Hohlakov, Lise, etc.), Doctor Varvinsky had put Mitya not with
other prisoners, but in a separate little room, the one where Smerdyakov
had been. It is true that there was a sentinel at the other
end of the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, so
that Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown,
which was not quite legal, indeed; but he was a kind-hearted and
compassionate young man. He knew how hard it would be for a
man like Mitya to pass at once so suddenly into the society of
<pb n='861'/><anchor id='Pg861'/>
robbers and murderers, and that he must get used to it by degrees.
The visits of relations and friends were informally sanctioned by
the doctor and overseer, and even by the police captain. But only
Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had tried to
force his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky
not to admit him.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing-gown,
rather feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his
head. He looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression,
but there was a shade of something like dread discernible
in it. He had become terribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes
he would be silent for half an hour together, and seemed to be
pondering something heavily and painfully, oblivious of everything
about him. If he roused himself from his brooding and began to
talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptness and never of what
he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a face of suffering
at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka
than with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her at all, but
as soon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with joy.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time
Mitya was waiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask
him a question. He felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would
consent to come, and at the same time he felt that if she did not
come, something inconceivable would happen. Alyosha understood
his feelings.
</p>

<p>
<q>Trifon Borissovitch,</q> Mitya began nervously, <q>has pulled his
whole inn to pieces, I am told. He's taken up the flooring, pulled
apart the planks, split up all the gallery, I am told. He is seeking
treasure all the time&mdash;the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor
said I'd hidden there. He began playing these tricks, they
say, as soon as he got home. Serve him right, the swindler! The
guard here told me yesterday; he comes from there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen,</q> began Alyosha. <q>She will come, but I don't know when.
Perhaps to-day, perhaps in a few days, that I can't tell. But she
will come, she will, that's certain.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The
news had a tremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would
have liked terribly to know what had been said, but he was again
<pb n='862'/><anchor id='Pg862'/>
afraid to ask. Something cruel and contemptuous from Katya
would have cut him like a knife at that moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>This was what she said among other things; that I must be
sure to set your conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not
well by then she will see to it all herself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've spoken of that already,</q> Mitya observed musingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you have repeated it to Grusha,</q> observed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Mitya admitted. <q>She won't come this morning.</q> He
looked timidly at his brother. <q>She won't come till the evening.
When I told her yesterday that Katya was taking measures, she was
silent, but she set her mouth. She only whispered, <q>Let her!</q> She
understood that it was important. I did not dare to try her further.
She understands now, I think, that Katya no longer cares for me,
but loves Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Does she?</q> broke from Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,</q>
Mitya hastened to explain again; <q>I asked her to do something for
me. You know, Ivan is superior to all of us. He ought to live,
not us. He will recover.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she
scarcely doubts of his recovery,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>That means that she is convinced he will die. It's because she is
frightened she's so sure he will get well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there's every
hope that he will get well,</q> Alyosha observed anxiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die.
She has a great deal of sorrow to bear...</q> A silence followed. A
grave anxiety was fretting Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly,</q> he said suddenly in a shaking
voice, full of tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>They won't let her go out there to you,</q> Alyosha put in at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>And there is something else I wanted to tell you,</q> Mitya went
on, with a sudden ring in his voice. <q>If they beat me on the way
or out there, I won't submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall
be shot for it. And this will be going on for twenty years! They
speak to me rudely as it is. I've been lying here all night, passing
judgment on myself. I am not ready! I am not able to resign
myself. I wanted to sing a <q>hymn</q>; but if a guard speaks rudely
<pb n='863'/><anchor id='Pg863'/>
to me, I have not the strength to bear it. For Grusha I would bear
anything ... anything except blows.... But she won't be allowed
to come there.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha smiled gently.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, brother, once for all,</q> he said. <q>This is what I think
about it. And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen:
you are not ready, and such a cross is not for you. What's more,
you don't need such a martyr's cross when you are not ready for it.
If you had murdered our father, it would grieve me that you should
reject your punishment. But you are innocent, and such a cross is
too much for you. You wanted to make yourself another man by
suffering. I say, only remember that other man always, all your
life and wherever you go; and that will be enough for you. Your
refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all your
life an even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more
to make you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there. For
there you would not endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last
would say: <q>I am quits.</q> The lawyer was right about that. Such
heavy burdens are not for all men. For some they are impossible.
These are my thoughts about it, if you want them so much. If other
men would have to answer for your escape, officers or soldiers, then
I would not have <q>allowed</q> you,</q> smiled Alyosha. <q>But they declare&mdash;the
superintendent of that <foreign rend='italic'>étape</foreign> told Ivan
himself&mdash;that if it's well managed there will be no great inquiry, and that they
can get off easily. Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such a case, but
I can't undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katya
commissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes.
I must tell you the truth. And so I can't judge of your own action.
But let me assure you that I shall never condemn you. And it would
be a strange thing if I could judge you in this. Now I think I've
gone into everything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I do condemn myself!</q> cried Mitya. <q>I shall escape, that
was settled apart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything
but run away? But I shall condemn myself, and I will pray for my
sin for ever. That's how the Jesuits talk, isn't it? Just as we are
doing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q> Alyosha smiled gently.
</p>

<p>
<q>I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding
<pb n='864'/><anchor id='Pg864'/>
anything,</q> cried Mitya, with a joyful laugh. <q>So I've caught my
Alyosha being Jesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to
the rest; I'll open the other side of my heart to you. This is what
I planned and decided. If I run away, even with money and a passport,
and even to America, I should be cheered up by the thought
that I am not running away for pleasure, not for happiness, but to
another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia. It is as bad, Alyosha, it is!
I hate that America, damn it, already. Even though Grusha will be
with me. Just look at her; is she an American? She is Russian,
Russian to the marrow of her bones; she will be homesick for the
mother country, and I shall see every hour that she is suffering for
my sake, that she has taken up that cross for me. And what harm
has she done? And how shall I, too, put up with the rabble out
there, though they may be better than I, every one of them? I hate
that America already! And though they may be wonderful at
machinery, every one of them, damn them, they are not of my soul.
I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though I am a scoundrel
myself. I shall choke there!</q> he exclaimed, his eyes suddenly
flashing. His voice was trembling with tears. <q>So this is what I've
decided, Alyosha, listen,</q> he began again, mastering his emotion.
<q>As soon as I arrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once
on the land, in solitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears.
There must be some remote parts even there. I am told there are
still Redskins there, somewhere, on the edge of the horizon. So to
the country of the <hi rend='italic'>Last of the Mohicans</hi>, and there we'll tackle the
grammar at once, Grusha and I. Work and grammar&mdash;that's how
we'll spend three years. And by that time we shall speak English
like any Englishman. And as soon as we've learnt it&mdash;good-by to
America! We'll run here to Russia as American citizens. Don't be
uneasy&mdash;we would not come to this little town. We'd hide somewhere,
a long way off, in the north or in the south. I shall be
changed by that time, and she will, too, in America. The doctors
shall make me some sort of wart on my face&mdash;what's the use of
their being so mechanical!&mdash;or else I'll put out one eye, let my beard
grow a yard, and I shall turn gray, fretting for Russia. I dare say
they won't recognize us. And if they do, let them send us to
Siberia. I don't care. It will show it's our fate. We'll work on the
land here, too, somewhere in the wilds, and I'll make up as an
<pb n='865'/><anchor id='Pg865'/>
American all my life. But we shall die on our own soil. That's
my plan, and it shan't be altered. Do you approve?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya
paused for a minute and said suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>And how they worked it up at the trial! Didn't they work it
up!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,</q>
said Alyosha, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it's hard,</q>
Mitya moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once!</q> he exclaimed suddenly.
<q>Tell me, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did
she say? How did she say it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She said she would come, but I don't know whether she will
come to-day. It's hard for her, you know,</q> Alyosha looked timidly
at his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out
of my mind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My
God, calm my heart: what is it I want? I want Katya! Do I
understand what I want? It's the headstrong, evil Karamazov
spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a scoundrel, that's all
one can say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here she is!</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment
she stood still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt
impulsively to his feet, and a scared look came into his face. He
turned pale, but a timid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once,
and with an irresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya.
Seeing it, she flew impetuously to him. She seized him by the hands,
and almost by force made him sit down on the bed. She sat down
beside him, and still keeping his hands pressed them violently.
Several times they both strove to speak, but stopped short and again
gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyes fastened on one
another. So passed two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you forgiven me?</q> Mitya faltered at last, and at the same
moment turning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried,
<q>Do you hear what I am asking, do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!</q>
<pb n='866'/><anchor id='Pg866'/>
broke from Katya. <q>My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours
to me; whether you forgive me or not, you will always be a sore
place in my heart, and I in yours&mdash;so it must be....</q> She stopped
to take breath. <q>What have I come for?</q> she began again with
nervous haste: <q>to embrace your feet, to press your hands like this,
till it hurts&mdash;you remember how in Moscow I used to squeeze them&mdash;to
tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you that I
love you madly,</q> she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed his
hand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes. Alyosha
stood speechless and confounded; he had never expected what he was
seeing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Love is over, Mitya!</q> Katya began again, <q>but the past is painfully
dear to me. Know that you will always be so. But now let
what might have been come true for one minute,</q> she faltered, with
a drawn smile, looking into his face joyfully again. <q>You love another
woman, and I love another man, and yet I shall love you for
ever, and you will love me; do you know that? Do you hear?
Love me, love me all your life!</q> she cried, with a quiver almost of
menace in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,</q> Mitya began,
drawing a deep breath at each word, <q>do you know, five days ago,
that same evening, I loved you.... When you fell down and were
carried out ... All my life! So it will be, so it will always be&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
So they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless,
perhaps not even true, but at that moment it was all true,
and they both believed what they said implicitly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Katya,</q> cried Mitya suddenly, <q>do you believe I murdered him?
I know you don't believe it now, but then ... when you gave
evidence.... Surely, surely you did not believe it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did not believe it even then. I've never believed it. I hated
you, and for a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving
evidence I persuaded myself and believed it, but when I'd finished
speaking I left off believing it at once. Don't doubt that! I have
forgotten that I came here to punish myself,</q> she said, with a new
expression in her voice, quite unlike the loving tones of a moment
before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Woman, yours is a heavy burden,</q> broke, as it were, involuntarily
from Mitya.
</p>

<pb n='867'/><anchor id='Pg867'/>

<p>
<q>Let me go,</q> she whispered. <q>I'll come again. It's more than I
can bear now.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud
scream and staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly
into the room. No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly
to the door, but when she reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly,
turned as white as chalk and moaned softly, almost in a whisper:
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,
venomous voice, answered:
</p>

<p>
<q>We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of
hatred! As though we could forgive one another! Save him, and
I'll worship you all my life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't forgive her!</q> cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be anxious, I'll save him for you!</q> Katya whispered
rapidly, and she ran out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your
forgiveness herself?</q> Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, don't dare to blame her; you have no right to!</q> Alyosha
cried hotly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,</q> Grushenka brought out in
a tone of disgust. <q>If she saves you I'll forgive her everything&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
She stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She
could not yet recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards,
accidentally, with no suspicion of what she would meet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, run after her!</q> Mitya cried to his brother; <q>tell her ... I
don't know ... don't let her go away like this!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll come to you again at nightfall,</q> said Alyosha, and he ran
after Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She
was walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said
quickly:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, before that woman I can't punish myself! I asked her forgiveness
because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She
would not forgive me.... I like her for that!</q> she added, in an
unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment.
</p>

<p>
<q>My brother did not expect this in the least,</q> muttered Alyosha.
<q>He was sure she would not come&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No doubt. Let us leave that,</q> she snapped. <q>Listen: I can't
<pb n='868'/><anchor id='Pg868'/>
go with you to the funeral now. I've sent them flowers. I think
they still have money. If necessary, tell them I'll never abandon
them.... Now leave me, leave me, please. You are late as it is&mdash;the
bells are ringing for the service.... Leave me, please!</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter III. Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech At The Stone</head>

<p>
He really was late. They had waited for him and had already
decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the
church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He
had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the
house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha's schoolfellows.
They had all been impatiently expecting him and were
glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them,
they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. <q>Father
will cry, be with father,</q> Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and
the boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>How glad I am you've come, Karamazov!</q> he cried, holding out
his hand to Alyosha. <q>It's awful here. It's really horrible to see it.
Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he's had nothing to
drink to-day, but he seems as if he were drunk ... I am always
manly, but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one
question before you go in?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, Kolya?</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father
or was it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven't slept for
the last four nights for thinking of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The valet killed him, my brother is innocent,</q> answered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what I said,</q> cried Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>So he will perish an innocent victim!</q> exclaimed Kolya; <q>though
he is ruined he is happy! I could envy him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? How can you? Why?</q> cried Alyosha surprised.
</p>

<pb n='869'/><anchor id='Pg869'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!</q> said
Kolya with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
<q>But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!</q>
said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for
disgrace, I don't care about that&mdash;our names may perish. I respect
your brother!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And so do I!</q> the boy, who had once declared that he knew who
had founded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed
up to his ears like a peony as he had done on that occasion.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded
and his eyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His
thin face was hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no
smell of decay from the corpse. The expression of his face was
serious and, as it were, thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his
breast, looked particularly beautiful, as though chiseled in marble.
There were flowers in his hands and the coffin, inside and out, was
decked with flowers, which had been sent early in the morning by
Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna,
and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain had a bunch in his
trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear boy.
He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in, and he would not
look at any one, even at his crazy weeping wife, <q>mamma,</q> who
kept trying to stand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her
dead boy. Nina had been pushed in her chair by the boys close up
to the coffin. She sat with her head pressed to it and she too was no
doubt quietly weeping. Snegiryov's face looked eager, yet bewildered
and exasperated. There was something crazy about his
gestures and the words that broke from him. <q>Old man, dear old
man!</q> he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was his habit
to call Ilusha <q>old man,</q> as a term of affection when he was alive.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his
hand and give it me,</q> the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either
because the little white rose in Ilusha's hand had caught her fancy
or that she wanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him,
she moved restlessly, stretching out her hands for the flower.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't give it to any one, I won't give you anything,</q> Snegiryov
<pb n='870'/><anchor id='Pg870'/>
cried callously. <q>They are his flowers, not yours! Everything is
his, nothing is yours!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, give mother a flower!</q> said Nina, lifting her face wet
with tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't give away anything and to her less than any one! She
didn't love Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it
to her,</q> the captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how
Ilusha had given up his cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy
creature was bathed in noiseless tears, hiding her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
The boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and
that it was time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and
began to lift it up.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want him to be buried in the churchyard,</q> Snegiryov
wailed suddenly; <q>I'll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha
told me to. I won't let him be carried out!</q>
</p>

<p>
He had been saying for the last three days that he would bury
him by the stone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister
and all the boys interfered.
</p>

<p>
<q>What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had
hanged himself!</q> the old landlady said sternly. <q>There in the
churchyard the ground has been crossed. He'll be prayed for there.
One can hear the singing in church and the deacon reads so plainly
and verbally that it will reach him every time just as though it were
read over his grave.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say,
<q>Take him where you will.</q> The boys raised the coffin, but as they
passed the mother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that
she might say good-by to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little
face, which for the last three days she had only looked at from a
distance, she trembled all over and her gray head began twitching
spasmodically over the coffin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your
blessing, kiss him,</q> Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched
like an automaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she
began, without a word, beating her breast with her fist. They
carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed her lips to her brother's
for the last time as they bore the coffin by her. As Alyosha went
out of the house he begged the landlady to look after those who
<pb n='871'/><anchor id='Pg871'/>
were left behind, but she interrupted him before he had finished.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure, I'll stay with them, we are Christians, too.</q> The
old woman wept as she said it.
</p>

<p>
They had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more
than three hundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight
frost. The church bells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing
and distracted after the coffin, in his short old summer overcoat,
with his head bare and his soft, old, wide-brimmed hat in his hand.
He seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety. At one minute he
stretched out his hand to support the head of the coffin and only
hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and tried to find
a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he rushed
to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the
loss of that flower.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the crust of bread, we've forgotten the crust!</q> he cried
suddenly in dismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he
had taken the crust of bread already and that it was in his pocket.
He instantly pulled it out and was reassured.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,</q> he explained at once to Alyosha. <q>I
was sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: <q>Father, when
my grave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the
sparrows may fly down, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not
to be lying alone.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a good thing,</q> said Alyosha, <q>we must often take some.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Every day, every day!</q> said the captain quickly, seeming cheered
at the thought.
</p>

<p>
They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle
of it. The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so,
all through the service. It was an old and rather poor church;
many of the ikons were without settings; but such churches are
the best for praying in. During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat
calmer, though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious
and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At one moment he went
up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle
fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful
time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the
coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the
Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside
<pb n='872'/><anchor id='Pg872'/>
him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain
what he meant. During the prayer, <q>Like the Cherubim,</q> he joined
in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he
pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.
</p>

<p>
At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed.
The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching
and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He
seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs,
which he tried at first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When
they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung
his arms about, as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha,
and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips.
At last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the
step, but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and
snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He looked at them and a
new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he apparently forgot
his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to sink into brooding
and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to the
grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the
church, Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary
rites the grave-diggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov with his
flowers in his hands bent down so low over the open grave that
the boys caught hold of his coat in alarm and pulled him back.
He did not seem to understand fully what was happening. When
they began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed anxiously at
the falling earth and began trying to say something, but no one
could make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he
was reminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully
excited, snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and
flinging the morsels on the grave.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!</q> he muttered anxiously.
</p>

<p>
One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble
the bread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give
them to some one to hold for a time. But he would not do this and
seemed indeed suddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they
wanted to take them from him altogether. And after looking at
the grave, and as it were, satisfying himself that everything had been
<pb n='873'/><anchor id='Pg873'/>
done and the bread had been crumbled, he suddenly, to the surprise
of every one, turned, quite composedly even, and made his way
homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, he almost
ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I
was unkind to mamma,</q> he began exclaiming suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Some one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he
flung the hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating,
<q>I won't have the hat, I won't have the hat.</q> Smurov picked
it up and carried it after him. All the boys were crying, and Kolya
and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all. Though
Smurov, with the captain's hat in his hand, was crying bitterly too,
he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on
the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was
flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on crying as he ran.
Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a minute,
as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to the
church, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly
overtook him and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell
helpless on the snow as though he had been knocked down, and
struggling, sobbing, and wailing, he began crying out, <q>Ilusha, old
man, dear old man!</q> Alyosha and Kolya tried to make him get up,
soothing and persuading him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,</q> muttered
Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll spoil the flowers,</q> said Alyosha, <q>and mamma is expecting
them, she is sitting crying because you would not give her any
before. Ilusha's little bed is still there&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, mamma!</q> Snegiryov suddenly recollected, <q>they'll take
away the bed, they'll take it away,</q> he added as though alarmed that
they really would. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But
it was not far off and they all arrived together. Snegiryov opened
the door hurriedly and called to his wife with whom he had so cruelly
quarreled just before:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,</q>
he cried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been
frozen and broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that
instant he saw in the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha's little boots,
<pb n='874'/><anchor id='Pg874'/>
which the landlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old,
patched, rusty-looking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed
to them, fell on his knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his
lips to it, began kissing it greedily, crying, <q>Ilusha, old man, dear
old man, where are your little feet?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?</q>
the lunatic cried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs.
Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha
too went out.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let them weep,</q> he said to Kolya, <q>it's no use trying to comfort
them just now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's no use, it's awful,</q> Kolya assented. <q>Do you know,
Karamazov,</q> he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them,
<q>I feel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him
back, I'd give anything in the world to do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, so would I,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here
to-night? He'll be drunk, you know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be
enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina.
If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again,</q>
Alyosha suggested.
</p>

<p>
<q>The landlady is laying the table for them now&mdash;there'll be a
funeral dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back
to it, Karamazov?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes
after it, it all seems so unnatural in our religion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They are going to have salmon, too,</q> the boy who had discovered
about Troy observed in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with
your idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and
doesn't care to know whether you exist or not!</q> Kolya snapped out
irritably. The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.
</p>

<p>
Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly
Smurov exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
<q>There's Ilusha's stone, under which they wanted to bury him.</q>
</p>

<p>
They all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the
<pb n='875'/><anchor id='Pg875'/>
whole picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day,
how Ilusha, weeping and hugging his father, had cried, <q>Father,
father, how he insulted you,</q> rose at once before his imagination.
</p>

<p>
A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and
earnest expression he looked from one to another of the bright,
pleasant faces of Ilusha's schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:
</p>

<p>
<q>Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant
eyes upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Boys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two
brothers, of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at
death's door. But soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long
time, so we shall part. Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha's stone,
that we will never forget Ilusha and one another. And whatever
happens to us later in life, if we don't meet for twenty years afterwards,
let us always remember how we buried the poor boy at whom
we once threw stones, do you remember, by the bridge? and afterwards
we all grew so fond of him. He was a fine boy, a kind-hearted,
brave boy, he felt for his father's honor and resented the cruel insult
to him and stood up for him. And so in the first place, we will
remember him, boys, all our lives. And even if we are occupied with
most important things, if we attain to honor or fall into great misfortune&mdash;still
let us remember how good it was once here, when we
were all together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us,
for the time we were loving that poor boy, better perhaps than we
are. My little doves&mdash;let me call you so, for you are very like them,
those pretty blue birds, at this minute as I look at your good dear
faces. My dear children, perhaps you won't understand what I am
saying to you, because I often speak very unintelligibly, but you'll
remember it all the same and will agree with my words some time.
You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more
wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory,
especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you a
great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory,
preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man
carries many such memories with him into life, he is safe to the
end of his days, and if one has only one good memory left in one's
heart, even that may sometime be the means of saving us. Perhaps
<pb n='876'/><anchor id='Pg876'/>
we may even grow wicked later on, may be unable to refrain from
a bad action, may laugh at men's tears and at those people who say
as Kolya did just now, <q>I want to suffer for all men,</q> and may even
jeer spitefully at such people. But however bad we may become&mdash;which
God forbid&mdash;yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how
we loved him in his last days, and how we have been talking like
friends all together, at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of
us&mdash;if we do become so&mdash;will not dare to laugh inwardly at having
been kind and good at this moment! What's more, perhaps, that one
memory may keep him from great evil and he will reflect and say,
<q>Yes, I was good and brave and honest then!</q> Let him laugh to
himself, that's no matter, a man often laughs at what's good and
kind. That's only from thoughtlessness. But I assure you, boys,
that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart, <q>No, I do wrong
to laugh, for that's not a thing to laugh at.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!</q> cried Kolya,
with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
The boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something,
but they restrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion
at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say this in case we become bad,</q> Alyosha went on, <q>but there's
no reason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be,
first and above all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget
each other! I say that again. I give you my word for my part
that I'll never forget one of you. Every face looking at me now
I shall remember even for thirty years. Just now Kolya said to
Kartashov that we did not care to know whether he exists or not.
But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and that he is not blushing
now as he did when he discovered the founders of Troy, but is
looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys, my dear
boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, brave and
generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much cleverer when
he is grown up), and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet as
Kartashov. But why am I talking about those two? You are all
dear to me, boys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart
for you all, and I beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me!
Well, and who has united us in this kind, good feeling which we
shall remember and intend to remember all our lives? Who, if not
<pb n='877'/><anchor id='Pg877'/>
Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to us for ever! Let us
never forget him. May his memory live for ever in our hearts from
this time forth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!</q> the boys cried in their ringing
voices, with softened faces.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little
boots, his coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he
stood up for him alone against the whole school.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will remember, we will remember,</q> cried the boys. <q>He
was brave, he was good!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how I loved him!</q> exclaimed Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don't be afraid of life! How
good life is when one does something good and just!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes,</q> the boys repeated enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov, we love you!</q> a voice, probably Kartashov's, cried
impulsively.
</p>

<p>
<q>We love you, we love you!</q> they all caught it up. There were
tears in the eyes of many of them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hurrah for Karamazov!</q> Kolya shouted ecstatically.
</p>

<p>
<q>And may the dead boy's memory live for ever!</q> Alyosha added
again with feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>For ever!</q> the boys chimed in again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov,</q> cried Kolya, <q>can it be true what's taught us in
religion, that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and
see each other again, all, Ilusha too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other
and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!</q>
Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how splendid it will be!</q> broke from Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner.
Don't be put out at our eating pancakes&mdash;it's a very old custom
and there's something nice in that!</q> laughed Alyosha. <q>Well, let us
go! And now we go hand in hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!</q>
Kolya cried once more rapturously, and once more the boys
took up his exclamation:
<q>Hurrah for Karamazov!</q>
</p>
