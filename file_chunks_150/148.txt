
<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of
exposition, beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation
a check on their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his
<pb n='810'/><anchor id='Pg810'/>
speech he went off into a dissertation on Grushenka's <q>first lover,</q>
and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed,
so to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first
lover. What makes it all the more strange is that he seems to have
hardly thought of this formidable rival. But he had looked upon
him as a remote danger, and Karamazov always lives in the present.
Possibly he regarded him as a fiction. But his wounded heart grasped
instantly that the woman had been concealing this new rival and
deceiving him, because he was anything but a fiction to her, because
he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this instantly, he
resigned himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected
trait in the prisoner's character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible
desire for justice, a respect for woman and a recognition
of her right to love. And all this at the very moment when he had
stained his hands with his father's blood for her sake! It is true
that the blood he had shed was already crying out for vengeance,
for, after having ruined his soul and his life in this world, he was
forced to ask himself at that same instant what he was and what
he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him than his own
soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned penitent,
with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with
honorable offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life.
And he, luckless man, what could he give her now, what could he
offer her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him
by his crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a
man with life before him! This thought crushed him. And so he
instantly flew to one frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's
character, must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his
terrible position. That way out was suicide. He ran for the pistols
he had left in pledge with his friend Perhotin and on the way, as
he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money, for the sake of which
he had stained his hands with his father's gore. Oh, now he needed
money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would
shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a
poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. <q>To her, to
<pb n='811'/><anchor id='Pg811'/>
her! and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such
as never was before, that will be remembered and talked of long
after! In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy
songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I
adore and her new-found happiness! And then, on the spot, at her
feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She
will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya
loved her, she will feel for Mitya!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and
sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes,
but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that
cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the
heart unto death&mdash;that <emph>something</emph> is conscience, gentlemen of the
jury, its judgment, its terrible torments! The pistol will settle
everything, the pistol is the only way out! But <emph>beyond</emph>&mdash;I don't
know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment <q>What lies
beyond,</q> and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder <q>What
lies beyond.</q> No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets,
but we still have our Karamazovs!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's preparations,
the scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the drivers. He
quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and
the picture made a terrible impression on the audience. The guilt
of this harassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing,
when the facts were brought together.
</p>

<p>
<q>What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost
confessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out.</q> (Then followed the
evidence given by witnesses.) <q rend='pre'>He even cried out to the peasant
who drove him, <q>Do you know, you are driving a murderer!</q> But
it was impossible for him to speak out, he had to get to Mokroe and
there to finish his romance. But what was awaiting the luckless
man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw that his invincible
rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the toast
to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be
acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from
the preliminary inquiry. Karamazov's triumph over his rival was
complete and his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most
terrible phase through which his soul has passed or will pass.</q>
</p>

<pb n='812'/><anchor id='Pg812'/>

<p>
<q>One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,</q> the prosecutor
continued, <q rend='pre'>that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring
their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice.
What's more, justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate
the punishment of nature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of
the criminal at such moments, as its salvation from despair. For I
cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when
he learnt that she loved him, that for his sake she had rejected her
first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya, to a new life, that
she was promising him happiness&mdash;and when? When everything
was over for him and nothing was possible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for
the light it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment. This
woman, this love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very
instant of his arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by
him but unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why
did he relinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was?
It was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying
it that restrained him. Throughout their revels he kept close to
his adored mistress, who was at the banquet with him and was more
charming and fascinating to him than ever&mdash;he did not leave her
side, abasing himself in his homage before her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear
of arrest, but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh,
only for a moment! I can picture the state of mind of the criminal
hopelessly enslaved by these influences&mdash;first, the influence of drink,
of noise and excitement, of the thud of the dance and the scream
of the song, and of her, flushed with wine, singing and dancing and
laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in the background that the
fatal end might still be far off, that not till next morning, at least,
they would come and take him. So he had a few hours and that's
much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many things.
I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when they
are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street
to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then
there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of
that street the dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning
of the journey the condemned man, sitting on his shameful
<pb n='813'/><anchor id='Pg813'/>
cart, must feel that he has infinite life still before him. The houses
recede, the cart moves on&mdash;oh, that's nothing, it's still far to the
turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and
to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes
fixed on him, and he still fancies that he is just such a man as they.
But now the turning comes to the next street. Oh, that's nothing,
nothing, there's still a whole street before him, and however many
houses have been passed, he will still think there are many left.
And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. <q>They've
not had time yet,</q> he must have thought, <q>I may still find some way
out, oh, there's still time to make some plan of defense, and now,
now&mdash;she is so fascinating!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however,
to put aside half his money and hide it somewhere&mdash;I cannot
otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand
he had just taken from his father's pillow. He had been in
Mokroe more than once before, he had caroused there for two days
together already, he knew the old big house with all its passages and
outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money was hidden in that
house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice, under some floor,
in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I shall be
asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he
hadn't yet considered how to meet it, he hadn't the time, his head
was throbbing and his heart was with <emph>her</emph>, but money&mdash;money was
indispensable in any case! With money a man is always a man.
Perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as unnatural?
But he assures us himself that a month before, at a critical
and exciting moment, he had halved his money and sewn it up in a
little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall prove directly,
it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had
contemplated it. What's more, when he declared at the inquiry
that he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never
existed) he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of
the moment, because he had two hours before divided his money and
hidden half of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency, simply
not to have it on himself. Two extremes, gentlemen of the
<pb n='814'/><anchor id='Pg814'/>
jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate two extremes and
both at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money.
It may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be
in the prisoner's hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his
knees before her, she was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched
out to her and he had so entirely forgotten everything that he did
not even hear the men coming to arrest him. He hadn't time to
prepare any line of defense in his mind. He was caught unawares
and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his destiny.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of
our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his
account, too! The moments of contemplating that animal fear,
when the criminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still means
to struggle, the moments when every instinct of self-preservation
rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and
suffering eyes, studies you, your face, your thoughts, uncertain on
which side you will strike, and his distracted mind frames thousands
of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to speak, afraid of giving
himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for
self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the human soul, are
awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal
even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some
very compromising phrases. <q>Blood! I've deserved it!</q> But he
quickly restrained himself. He had not prepared what he was to
say, what answer he was to make, he had nothing but a bare denial
ready. <q>I am not guilty of my father's death.</q> That was his fence
for the moment and behind it he hoped to throw up a barricade of
some sort. His first compromising exclamations he hastened to
explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death of the
servant Grigory only. <q>Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has
killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have
killed him, <emph>if not I</emph>?</q> Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had
come to ask him that question! Do you hear that phrase uttered
with such premature haste&mdash;<q>if not I</q>&mdash;the animal cunning, the naïveté,
the Karamazov impatience of it? <q>I didn't kill him and you
mustn't think I did! I wanted to kill him, gentlemen, I wanted
<pb n='815'/><anchor id='Pg815'/>
to kill him,</q> he hastens to admit (he was in a hurry, in a terrible
hurry), <q>but still I am not guilty, it is not I murdered him.</q> He
concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though to say, you
can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you'll believe all the
sooner that I didn't murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is
often amazingly shallow and credulous.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally,
the most simple question, <q>Wasn't it Smerdyakov killed
him?</q> Then, as we expected, he was horribly angry at our having
anticipated him and caught him unawares, before he had time to
pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be
most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name. He rushed at once
to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to assure us that
Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of it. But
don't believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn't really give
up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him
forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but
he would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled
for him. He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a
few days later, choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, <q>You know
I was more skeptical about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that
yourselves, but now I am convinced. He killed him, he must have
done!</q> And for the present he falls back upon a gloomy and irritable
denial. Impatience and anger prompted him, however, to the
most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked into his
father's window and how he respectfully withdrew. The worst of
it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the evidence
given by Grigory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged
him, the whole three thousand had not been found on him,
only half of it. And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence,
the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him. No doubt he was
conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully
to make it sound more likely, to weave it into a romance that
would sound plausible. In such cases the first duty, the chief task
of the investigating lawyers, is to prevent the criminal being prepared,
to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out
his cherished ideas in all their simplicity, improbability and inconsistency.
<pb n='816'/><anchor id='Pg816'/>
The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and
apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of some circumstance
of great importance in the case, of which he had no previous
idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in
readiness&mdash;that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through
which the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about
that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have
seen it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us,
<q>Then Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!</q> and so
betrayed the basis of the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed
it in its most improbable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have
committed the murder after he had knocked Grigory down and run
away. When we told him that Grigory saw the door was open
before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as
he came out of his bedroom&mdash;Karamazov was positively crushed. My
esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards
that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And
to improve matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of
little bag&mdash;so be it, you shall hear this romance!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider
this romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention
that could have been brought forward in the circumstances. If
one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could
hardly find anything more incredible. The worst of such stories is
that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and
crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which
these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers neglect as insignificant
trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details, their
minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and
fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that's how
they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, <q>Where did
you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?</q> <q>I
made it myself.</q> <q>And where did you get the linen?</q> The prisoner
was positively offended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him
such a trivial question, and would you believe it, his resentment was
genuine! But they are all like that. <q>I tore it off my shirt.</q> <q>Then
we shall find that shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece
<pb n='817'/><anchor id='Pg817'/>
torn off.</q> And only fancy, gentlemen of the jury, if we really had
found that torn shirt (and how could we have failed to find it in his
chest of drawers or trunk?) that would have been a fact, a material
fact in support of his statement! But he was incapable of that reflection.
<q>I don't remember, it may not have been off my shirt, I
sewed it up in one of my landlady's caps.</q> <q>What sort of a cap?</q> <q>It
was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.</q> <q>And do you remember
that clearly?</q> <q>No, I don't.</q> And he was angry, very angry, and
yet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments
of man's life, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers
just such trifles. He will forget anything but some green
roof that has flashed past him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross&mdash;that
he will remember. He concealed the making of that little
bag from his household, he must have remembered his humiliating
fear that some one might come in and find him needle in hand, how
at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen (there is a screen
in his lodgings).</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these
details, trifles?</q> cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. <q>Just because
the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He
has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago,
he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic
statements; all those are trivialities. <q>You must believe it on my
honor.</q> Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are eager to believe it,
even if only on his word of honor! Are we jackals thirsting for
human blood? Show us a single fact in the prisoner's favor and we
shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion
drawn from the prisoner's expression by his own brother, or that
when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to
the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new fact,
we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to
repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot
repudiate anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as
though he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance,
the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base
motive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency
of the facts.
</p>

<pb n='818'/><anchor id='Pg818'/>

<p>
<q>And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated
counsel for the defense,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding,
<q>whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities,
remember that at this moment you are in a temple of
justice. Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the
champions of our holy Russia, of her principles, her family, everything
that she holds sacred! Yes, you represent Russia here at this
moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but
will reëcho throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia will
hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be encouraged
or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and her
expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps
to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched
out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course.
And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not
from respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from
horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that
they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so and
will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will
check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own
safety, enlightenment and civilization. Already we have heard
voices of alarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not
tempt them! Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence
justifying the murder of a father by his son!</q>
</p>

<p>
Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up
his speech with this rhetorical appeal&mdash;and the effect produced by
him was extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went
out hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the
adjoining room. There was no applause in the court, but serious
persons were pleased. The ladies were not so well satisfied, though
even they were pleased with his eloquence, especially as they had no
apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in
Fetyukovitch. <q>He will speak at last and of course carry all before
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the
prosecutor's speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and
his head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and
listened, especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the
<pb n='819'/><anchor id='Pg819'/>
prosecutor mentioned Rakitin's opinion of her, a smile of contempt
and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly,
<q>The Bernards!</q> When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had
questioned and tortured him at Mokroe, Mitya raised his head and
listened with intense curiosity. At one point he seemed about to
jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his
shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end of the
speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe,
and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. <q>The man could not resist boasting
of his cleverness,</q> they said.
</p>

<p>
The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter
of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation
and exclamations in the audience. I remember some of
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>A weighty speech,</q> a gentleman in one group observed gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>He brought in too much psychology,</q> said another voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>But it was all true, the absolute truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he is first rate at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He summed it all up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he summed us up, too,</q> chimed in another voice. <q>Do you
remember, at the beginning of his speech, making out we were all
like Fyodor Pavlovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And at the end, too. But that was all rot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And obscure too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He was a little too much carried away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's unjust, it's unjust.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it was smartly done, anyway. He's had long to wait, but
he's had his say, ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What will the counsel for the defense say?</q>
</p>

<p>
In another group I heard:
</p>

<p>
<q>He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like
that; <q>appealing to your sensibilities</q>&mdash;do you remember?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that was awkward of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He was in too great a hurry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a nervous man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what must it be for Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
In a third group:
</p>

<pb n='820'/><anchor id='Pg820'/>

<p>
<q>What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the
end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a general's wife, divorced, I know her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's why she has the lorgnette.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is not good for much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is
prettier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn't they, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, it was smart enough. We've heard it before, how often he
has told the story at people's houses!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And he couldn't resist doing it now. That's vanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a man with a grievance, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much
rhetoric, such long sentences.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you
remember about the troika? Something about <q>They have Hamlets,
but we have, so far, only Karamazovs!</q> That was cleverly said!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatever he says, he won't get round our peasants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't you think so?</q>
</p>

<p>
A fourth group:
</p>

<p>
<q>What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the
other nations.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And that was true what he said about other nations not standing
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and
speaking about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not
high time to intervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was
thinking of him, I know he was. He was talking about that last
week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not an easy job.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not an easy job? Why not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, we'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn.
Where would they get it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='821'/><anchor id='Pg821'/>

<p>
<q>In America. They get it from America now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q>
</p>

<p>
But the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch
mounted the tribune.

<head>Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways</head>

<p>
All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out.
The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began
very simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the
slightest trace of conceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at
pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a man speaking in a circle
of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice was a fine one,
sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine and
simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that
the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and <q>pierce the
heart with untold power.</q> His language was perhaps more irregular
than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he spoke without long phrases, and
indeed, with more precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he
kept bending forward, especially at the beginning of his speech, not
exactly bowing, but as though he were about to dart at his listeners,
bending his long spine in half, as though there were a spring in the
middle that enabled him to bend almost at right angles.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly,
without system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though,
at the end, these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided
into two parts, the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the
charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half
he suddenly changed his tone, and even his manner, and at once
rose to pathos. The audience seemed on the look-out for it, and
quivered with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although
he practiced in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial
towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or
<pb n='822'/><anchor id='Pg822'/>
at least a preconceived idea. <q>That is what has happened to me in
the present case,</q> he explained. <q>From the very first accounts in
the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed
me in the prisoner's favor. What interested me most was a
fact which often occurs in legal practice, but rarely, I think, in such
an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case. I ought to
formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech, but I will
do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to work
directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my material.
That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it's sincere.
What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of
evidence against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that
will stand criticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the
case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed,
and I suddenly received from the prisoner's relatives a request
to undertake his defense. I at once hurried here, and here I
became completely convinced. It was to break down this terrible
chain of facts, and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately
was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the case.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Fetyukovitch began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> he suddenly protested, <q>I am new to this
district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of
turbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has
insulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced
many people against him beforehand. Of course I recognize that
the moral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him.
The prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper. Yet he was received
in society here; he was even welcome in the family of my
talented friend, the prosecutor.</q>
</p>

<p>
(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,
quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that
the prosecutor received Mitya against his will, solely because he had
somehow interested his wife&mdash;a lady of the highest virtue and moral
worth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her husband,
especially in trifles. Mitya's visits, however, had not been frequent.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I venture to suggest,</q> Fetyukovitch continued,
<q>that in spite of his independent mind and just character, my
opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate
<pb n='823'/><anchor id='Pg823'/>
client. Oh, that is so natural; the unfortunate man has only
too well deserved such prejudice. Outraged morality, and still more
outraged taste, is often relentless. We have, in the talented prosecutor's
speech, heard a stern analysis of the prisoner's character and
conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the case was evident.
And, what's more, he went into psychological subtleties into which
he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and malicious
prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are
even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious
and consciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away
by the artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a
romance, especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight.
Before I started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg,
and was myself aware, that I should find here a talented opponent
whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained him peculiar
renown in legal circles of recent years. But profound as psychology
is, it's a knife that cuts both ways.</q> (Laughter among the public.)
<q rend='pre'>You will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can't boast of eloquence.
But I will take as an example any point in the prosecutor's
speech.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed
over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down
with a brass pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent
five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he had killed
him or not. And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's
statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity. <q>No,</q> he says,
<q>such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that's unnatural;
he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead
or alive, and so showed that he had committed the murder, since he
would not have run back for any other reason.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method
and apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be
no less probable. The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out,
as a precaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he had left
in his murdered father's study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an
amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope, with an
inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it. <q>If he
had carried that envelope away with him, no one in the world would
<pb n='824'/><anchor id='Pg824'/>
have known of that envelope and of the notes in it, and that the
money had been stolen by the prisoner.</q> Those are the prosecutor's
own words. So on one side you see a complete absence of precaution,
a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright, leaving that
clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed another
man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating
foresight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological
subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances
I become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle,
while at the next I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so
bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only
run back to find out whether he is alive to witness against me, why
should I spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk
of encountering other witnesses? Why soak my handkerchief, wiping
the blood off his head so that it may be evidence against me
later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why not hit the
servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill
him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he
left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had
taken from the two women, and which they could always recognize
afterwards as theirs, and prove that he had taken it from them.
And it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it
through carelessness or haste, no, he had flung away his weapon, for
it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay. Why did he do
so? Just because he was grieved at having killed a man, an old
servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous
weapon. That's how it must have been, what other reason could he
have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling
grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent
of his father's murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have
run to another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently;
his thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation.
He would have had none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt.
On the contrary, he would have broken his skull instead of spending
five minutes looking after him. There was room for pity and good-feeling
just because his conscience had been clear till then. Here
we have a different psychology. I have purposely resorted to this
<pb n='825'/><anchor id='Pg825'/>
method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything
by it. It all depends on who makes use of it. Psychology
lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously.
I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor,
were again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in
detail; I will only quote some passages from it, some leading points.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery</head>

<p>
There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch's
speech. He flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand
roubles, and consequently, the possibility of their having been
stolen.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> he began. <q rend='pre'>Every new and unprejudiced
observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the
present case, namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility
of proving that there was anything to be stolen. We are
told that money was stolen&mdash;three thousand roubles&mdash;but whether
those roubles ever existed, nobody knows. Consider, how have we
heard of that sum, and who has seen the notes? The only person
who saw them, and stated that they had been put in the envelope,
was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the prisoner
and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe. Madame
Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three persons
had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and that
Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time?
What if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put
them back in his cash-box without telling him? Note, that according
to Smerdyakov's story the notes were kept under the mattress;
the prisoner must have pulled them out, and yet the bed was absolutely
unrumpled; that is carefully recorded in the protocol. How
could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the
<pb n='826'/><anchor id='Pg826'/>
bed? How could he have helped soiling with his blood-stained hands
the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely
made?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes,
it's worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat
surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor
declare of himself&mdash;of himself, observe&mdash;that but for that envelope,
but for its being left on the floor, no one in the world would have
known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it, and
therefore of the prisoner's having stolen it. And so that torn scrap
of paper is, by the prosecutor's own admission, the sole proof on
which the charge of robbery rests, <q>otherwise no one would have
known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.</q> But is the
mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof
that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?
Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the
envelope. But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask
you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen
the notes two days before the catastrophe. Then why not imagine
that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient and
hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration, may have
whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out
the notes. <q>What's the use of the envelope?</q> he may have asked
himself. <q>She won't believe the notes are there, but when I show
her the thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more
impression, you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.</q> And
so he tears open the envelope, takes out the money, and flings the
envelope on the floor, conscious of being the owner and untroubled
by any fears of leaving evidence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this
theory and such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if
anything of the sort could have taken place, the charge of robbery
falls to the ground; if there was no money, there was no theft of it.
If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had
been money in it, why may I not maintain the opposite, that the
envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it
by its owner?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch
<pb n='827'/><anchor id='Pg827'/>
took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the
police searched the house? In the first place, part of the money
was found in the cash-box, and secondly, he might have taken it
out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of
it, to give or send it away; he may have changed his idea, his plan
of action completely, without thinking it necessary to announce the
fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is the barest possibility
of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so positively
accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and
of having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on
the domain of romance. If it is maintained that something has
been stolen, the thing must be produced, or at least its existence
must be proved beyond doubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly
more than a boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger,
went in broad daylight into a moneychanger's shop with an ax, and
with extraordinary, typical audacity killed the master of the shop
and carried off fifteen hundred roubles. Five hours later he was
arrested, and, except fifteen roubles he had already managed to spend,
the whole sum was found on him. Moreover, the shopman, on his
return to the shop after the murder, informed the police not only
of the exact sum stolen, but even of the notes and gold coins of
which that sum was made up, and those very notes and coins were
found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and genuine
confession on the part of the murderer. That's what I call evidence,
gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch
the money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present
case? And yet it is a question of life and death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering
money; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles&mdash;where
did he get the money? But the very fact that only fifteen
hundred could be found, and the other half of the sum could nowhere
be discovered, shows that that money was not the same, and
had never been in any envelope. By strict calculation of time it
was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight
from those women servants to Perhotin's without going home, and
that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in company
and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and
<pb n='828'/><anchor id='Pg828'/>
hidden half in the town. It's just this consideration that has led the
prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at
Mokroe. Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen?
Isn't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic?
And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the whole charge of
robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case what could have
become of the other fifteen hundred roubles? By what miracle could
they have disappeared, since it's proved the prisoner went nowhere
else? And we are ready to ruin a man's life with such tales!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the
fifteen hundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without
money before that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner
has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that
money, and if you will have it so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing
can be more probable than that statement, and more consistent with
the temper and spirit of the prisoner. The prosecutor is charmed
with his own romance. A man of weak will, who had brought
himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his
betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it
up, but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two
days and taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a
month. All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone
that brooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened
quite differently? What if you've been weaving a romance, and
about quite a different kind of man? That's just it, you have
invented quite a different man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on
one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month
before the catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half.
But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been
shown in court already. Besides, in another man's hand a crust
always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that
money; they all judged simply at sight. And the witness Maximov
has testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his hand. You
see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two-edged weapon. Let
me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by
Katerina Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post.
<pb n='829'/><anchor id='Pg829'/>
But the question is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in
such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now?
The first statement made by the young lady on the subject was different,
perfectly different. In the second statement we heard only
cries of resentment and revenge, cries of long-concealed hatred.
And the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly,
gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of evidence
may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare
not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch
on it either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and
high-principled person, such as that highly respected young lady
unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in
court to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive
of ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given
not impartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that
a revengeful woman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may
well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult and humiliation of
her offering him the money. No, it was offered in such a way that
it was possible to take it, especially for a man so easy-going as the
prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive shortly from his father
the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was owing to him. It
was unreflecting of him, but it was just his irresponsible want of
reflection that made him so confident that his father would give him
the money, that he would get it, and so could always dispatch the
money entrusted to him and repay the debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day
have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That's
not his character, he tells us, he couldn't have had such feelings.
But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried
out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at
once. Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature, fluctuating between
two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent
craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if something
strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is love&mdash;that
new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he
needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress.
If she were to say to him, <q>I am yours, I won't have Fyodor Pavlovitch,</q>
then he must have money to take her away. That was more
<pb n='830'/><anchor id='Pg830'/>
important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand
it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from&mdash;what is
there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in
case of emergency?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner
the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that
he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner,
loved. <q>If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn't give the money,</q> he thought,
<q>I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina
Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried
round his neck, and say, <q>I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.</q>
So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that
sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he shouldn't unpick the
little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why should you
deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of honor,
granted that it's misplaced, granted it's often mistaken, yet it exists
and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments
reach a climax, and those same two questions torture his
fevered brain more and more: <q>If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where
can I find the means to go off with Grushenka?</q> If he behaved
wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the taverns in the course
of that month, it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained
beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions became so
acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his younger
brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles, but
without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating
the old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect
of getting it from any one; his father would not give it him
after that beating.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the
upper part of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his
brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still
he would remain a scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use
that means, that he wouldn't have the character, that he wouldn't
have the will-power to do it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse
to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so genuinely
<pb n='831'/><anchor id='Pg831'/>
and sincerely, so spontaneously and convincingly? And why, on the
contrary, does he force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice,
in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner
wrote that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous
proof of the prisoner having committed robbery! <q>I shall
beg from every one, and if I don't get it I shall murder my father
and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under
his mattress as soon as Ivan has gone.</q> A full program of the murder,
we are told, so it must have been he. <q>It has all been done as he
wrote,</q> cries the prosecutor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and written
in great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from
what he has heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the
envelope himself; and thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you
prove that he did it? Did the prisoner take the envelope from under
the pillow, did he find the money, did that money exist indeed?
And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off, if you remember?
He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out where she was,
the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry out
a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act
of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a
jealous fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered
him he seized the money, too. But did he murder him after
all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man
cannot be accused of robbery, if it's impossible to state accurately
what he has stolen; that's an axiom. But did he murder him without
robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved? Isn't that,
too, a romance?</q>
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either</head>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a
man's life is at stake and that you must be careful. We have
heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to-day he hesitated to
<pb n='832'/><anchor id='Pg832'/>
accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the
crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was
produced in court to-day. <q>All was done as written.</q> But, I repeat
again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely to find out where
she was. That's a fact that can't be disputed. Had she been at
home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at
her side, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter.
He ran unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very
likely he did not even remember his drunken letter. <q>He snatched
up the pestle,</q> they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice
of psychology was built on that pestle&mdash;why he was bound to look
at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on. A
very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that
pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from
which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away
in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner's eye, and he
would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and
then he would certainly not have killed any one. How then can I
look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and
two days before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter,
he was quiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because
a Karamazov could not help quarreling, forsooth! But my
answer to that is, that, if he was planning such a murder in accordance
with his letter, he certainly would not have quarreled even with
a shopman, and probably would not have gone into the tavern at
all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement,
seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard, and that
not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,
the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can
use it. As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month,
don't we often hear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns
shout, <q>I'll kill you</q>? but they don't murder any one. And that
fatal letter&mdash;isn't that simply drunken irritability, too? Isn't that
simply the shout of the brawler outside the tavern, <q>I'll kill you!
I'll kill the lot of you!</q> Why not, why could it not be that? What
reason have we to call that letter <q>fatal</q> rather than absurd? Because
his father has been found murdered, because a witness saw the
<pb n='833'/><anchor id='Pg833'/>
prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his hand, and
was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything was
done as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not <q>absurd,</q>
but <q>fatal.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now, thank God! we've come to the real point: <q>since he was
in the garden, he must have murdered him.</q> In those few words:
<q>since he <emph>was</emph>, then he <emph>must</emph></q> lies the whole case for the
prosecution. He was there, so he must have. And what if there is no <emph>must</emph>
about it, even if he was there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence&mdash;the
coincidences&mdash;are really suggestive. But examine all these facts
separately, regardless of their connection. Why, for instance, does
the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner's statement
that he ran away from his father's window? Remember the
sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the
respectful and <q>pious</q> sentiments which suddenly came over the murderer.
But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of
religious awe, if not of filial respect? <q>My mother must have been
praying for me at that moment,</q> were the prisoner's words at the
preliminary inquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced
himself that Madame Svyetlov was not in his father's house. <q>But
he could not convince himself by looking through the window,</q>
the prosecutor objects. But why couldn't he? Why? The window
opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some word might have
been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which showed
the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume everything
as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A
thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest
imagination.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly
was in the house, therefore he killed him.</q> Now about that
door, gentlemen of the jury.... Observe that we have only the
statement of one witness as to that door, and he was at the time
in such a condition, that&mdash; But supposing the door was open; supposing
the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an instinct of self-defense,
natural in his position; supposing he did go into the house&mdash;well,
what then? How does it follow that because he was there he
committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through the
rooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him;
<pb n='834'/><anchor id='Pg834'/>
but as soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he
may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had
not killed his father. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped
from the temptation to kill his father, because he had a clear conscience
and was rejoicing at not having killed him, that he was
capable of a pure feeling, the feeling of pity and compassion, and
leapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of Grigory after
he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the
dreadful state of the prisoner's mind at Mokroe when love again lay
before him calling him to new life, while love was impossible for
him because he had his father's bloodstained corpse behind him and
beyond that corpse&mdash;retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed
him love, which he explained, according to his method, talking
about his drunken condition, about a criminal being taken to execution,
about it being still far off, and so on and so on. But again I
ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not invented a new personality? Is
the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment
of love and of dodges to escape punishment, if his hands were
really stained with his father's blood? No, no, no! As soon as it
was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her
side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must have
felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed
himself, if he had his father's murder on his conscience. Oh, no!
he would not have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the
prisoner: the savage, stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor
is inconsistent with his character. He would have killed
himself, that's certain. He did not kill himself just because <q>his
mother's prayers had saved him,</q> and he was innocent of his father's
blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that night at Mokroe only
about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man would recover,
that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not have
to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?
What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But we shall be told at once again, <q>There is his father's corpse!
If he ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?</q>
Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who
murdered him, if not he? There's no one to put in his place.</q>
</p>

<pb n='835'/><anchor id='Pg835'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually
true that there is no one else at all? We've heard the prosecutor
count on his fingers all the persons who were in that house that
night. They were five in number; three of them, I agree, could not
have been responsible&mdash;the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and
his wife. There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the
prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov
because he had no one else to fix on, that had there been a
sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would have abandoned
the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have
accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not
draw the very opposite conclusion? There are two persons&mdash;the
prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my
client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And you
have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov
from all suspicion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It's true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his
two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who
accuse him: there are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion,
an obscure report, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence
of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit,
inconclusive. In the first place we have precisely on the day of the
catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor,
for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful defense. Then
Smerdyakov's sudden suicide on the eve of the trial. Then the
equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the elder of the
prisoner's brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has to-day
produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer.
Oh, I fully share the court's and the prosecutor's conviction
that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement
may really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save
his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man. But again
Smerdyakov's name is pronounced, again there is a suggestion of
mystery. There is something unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps
it may one day be explained. But we won't go into that now.
Of that later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime,
I might make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov
<pb n='836'/><anchor id='Pg836'/>
drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while
I admire his talent I cannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov,
I have seen him and talked to him, and he made a very different
impression on me. He was weak in health, it is true; but in
character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor
has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the timidity
on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity about
him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme mistrustfulness
concealed under a mask of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïveté</foreign>,
and an intelligence of
considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him
for weak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left
him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature,
excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made
some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and
would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of
<q>stinking Lizaveta.</q> He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory
and his wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed
and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming
a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn't the means
to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely
high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to
good clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself
to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence
of this), he might well have resented his position, compared
with that of his master's legitimate sons. They had everything, he
nothing. They had all the rights, they had the inheritance, while
he was only the cook. He told me himself that he had helped Fyodor
Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The destination of
that sum&mdash;a sum which would have made his career&mdash;must have
been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in
new rainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.)
Oh, beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of
money at once! And it was the first time he had seen so much
money in the hands of one man. The sight of the rainbow-colored
notes may have made a morbid impression on his imagination, but
with no immediate results.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched
for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov's
<pb n='837'/><anchor id='Pg837'/>
guilt, and asked us in particular what motive he had in
feigning a fit. But he may not have been feigning at all, the fit
may have happened quite naturally, but it may have passed off
quite naturally, and the sick man may have recovered, not completely
perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as happens with
epileptics.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have
committed the murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment.
He might have waked up from deep sleep (for he was only
asleep&mdash;an epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep) at that
moment when the old Grigory shouted at the top of his voice <q>Parricide!</q>
That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov
whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment: he
might naturally have waked up an hour before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no
definite motive towards the sound to see what's the matter. His
head is still clouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep;
but, once in the garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he
hears terrible news from his master, who would be, of course, glad
to see him. His mind sets to work at once. He hears all the details
from his frightened master, and gradually in his disordered brain
there shapes itself an idea&mdash;terrible, but seductive and irresistibly
logical. To kill the old man, take the three thousand, and throw
all the blame on to his young master. A terrible lust of money,
of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security from detection.
Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often
when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers
who have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And
Smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his plan. With what
weapon? Why, with any stone picked up in the garden. But what
for, with what object? Why, the three thousand which means a
career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting myself&mdash;the money
may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to
find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money&mdash;the
torn envelope on the floor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory
that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the
envelope on the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would
have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as
<pb n='838'/><anchor id='Pg838'/>
I listened that I was hearing something very familiar, and, would
you believe it, I have heard that very argument, that very conjecture,
of how Karamazov would have behaved, precisely two days
before, from Smerdyakov himself. What's more, it struck me at the
time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him;
that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy
it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate
the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented
prosecutor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be asked, <q>What about the old woman, Grigory's wife?
She heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.</q> Yes, she heard
it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who
complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a
dog in the yard. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped
once or twice in the night. And that's natural. If any one is
asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but
instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a groan, he
wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two
hours later&mdash;three times altogether in the night. Next morning
the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning
all night and keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to
him: the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember, he
only remembers the moments of waking, so he feels he has been
waked up all night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess
in his last letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step
and not to both? But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and
the suicide may not have felt penitence, but only despair. Despair
and penitence are two very different things. Despair may be vindictive
and irreconcilable, and the suicide, laying his hands on himself,
may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had
envied all his life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice!
What is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find
the error in my reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And
if there is but a shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my
propositions, do not condemn him. And is there only a shade? I
swear by all that is sacred, I fully believe in the explanation of the
murder I have just put forward. What troubles me and makes me
<pb n='839'/><anchor id='Pg839'/>
indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution
against the prisoner, there is not a single one certain and
irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation
of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the
blood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt,
the dark night resounding with the shout <q>Parricide!</q> and the old
man falling with a broken head. And then the mass of phrases,
statements, gestures, shouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can
so bias the mind; but, gentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds?
Remember, you have been given absolute power to bind and to
loose, but the greater the power, the more terrible its responsibility.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now,
but suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my
luckless client had stained his hands with his father's blood. This
is only hypothesis, I repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his
innocence. But, so be it, I assume that my client is guilty of
parricide. Even so, hear what I have to say. I have it in my heart
to say something more to you, for I feel that there must be a great
conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive my referring to
your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to be
truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause.
The last words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity
that every one felt that he really might have something to
say, and that what he was about to say would be of the greatest
consequence. But the President, hearing the applause, in a loud
voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were repeated.
Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch began in a voice full of
feeling quite unlike the tone he had used hitherto.

<head>Chapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought</head>

<p>
<q>It's not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client
with ruin, gentlemen of the jury,</q> he began, <q rend='pre'>what is really
damning for my client is one fact&mdash;the dead body of his father.
<pb n='840'/><anchor id='Pg840'/>
Had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the
charge in view of the triviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic
character of the evidence, if you examine each part of it
separately; or, at least, you would have hesitated to ruin a man's
life simply from the prejudice against him which he has, alas! only
too well deserved. But it's not an ordinary case of murder, it's a
case of parricide. That impresses men's minds, and to such a degree
that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes
less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind. How
can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he committed the murder
and gets off unpunished? That is what every one, almost involuntarily,
instinctively, feels at heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, it's a fearful thing to shed a father's blood&mdash;the father who
has begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over
my illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness,
and has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a
father&mdash;that's inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a
father&mdash;a real father? What is the meaning of that great word?
What is the great idea in that name? We have just indicated in
part what a true father is and what he ought to be. In the case
in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts
are aching&mdash;in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov,
did not correspond to that conception of a father to which
we have just referred. That's the misfortune. And indeed some
fathers are a misfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather
more closely: we must shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury,
considering the importance of the decision you have to make. It's
our particular duty not to shrink from any idea, like children or
frightened women, as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent
(and he was my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several
times, <q>Oh, I will not yield the defense of the prisoner to the
lawyer who has come down from Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend
also!</q> He exclaimed that several times, but forgot to mention
that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three years so grateful
for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who had been
kind to him, as a child in his father's house, might not such a man
well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his
<pb n='841'/><anchor id='Pg841'/>
father's back-yard, <q>without boots on his feet and with his little
trousers hanging by one button</q>&mdash;to use the expression of the kind-hearted
doctor, Herzenstube?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at
this misfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did
my client meet with when he arrived here, at his father's house, and
why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled,
he is wild and unruly&mdash;we are trying him now for that&mdash;but
who is responsible for his life? Who is responsible for his
having received such an unseemly bringing up, in spite of his excellent
disposition and his grateful and sensitive heart? Did any one
train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by study? Did any
one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was left to
the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted perhaps
to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand
times perhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away
the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with
all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to forgive his
father! And what awaited him? He was met by cynical taunts,
suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard nothing but revolting
talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy, and
at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with his own
money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!
And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and
cruelty of his son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated
him, bought up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into
prison.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce,
unruly, and uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently
indeed, exceedingly tender-hearted, only they don't express
it. Don't laugh, don't laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor
laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving Schiller&mdash;loving
the sublime and beautiful! I should not have laughed at that
in his place. Yes, such natures&mdash;oh, let me speak in defense of such
natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood&mdash;these natures often
thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in contrast to
themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity&mdash;they thirst for it unconsciously.
Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully
<pb n='842'/><anchor id='Pg842'/>
capable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated
love. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in
such natures. But they cannot hide their passions&mdash;sometimes very
coarse&mdash;and that is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is
unseen. Their passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a
noble and lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks
a new life, seeks to correct himself, to be better, to become noble
and honorable, <q>sublime and beautiful,</q> however much the expression
has been ridiculed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client's
engagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard
just now was not evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and
revengeful woman, and it was not for her&mdash;oh, not for her!&mdash;to
reproach him with treachery, for she has betrayed him! If she had
had but a little time for reflection she would not have given such
evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client is not a monster,
as she called him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: <q>I
am the Good Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for
his sheep, so that not one of them might be lost.</q> Let not a man's
soul be lost through us!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I asked just now what does <q>father</q> mean, and exclaimed that it
was a great word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly,
gentlemen, and I venture to call things by their right names:
such a father as old Karamazov cannot be called a father and does
not deserve to be. Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity,
an impossibility. Love cannot be created from nothing: only God
can create something from nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,</q> the apostle writes,
from a heart glowing with love. It's not for the sake of my client
that I quote these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers.
Who has authorized me to preach to fathers? No one. But as a
man and a citizen I make my appeal&mdash;<foreign rend='italic'>vivos
voco!</foreign> We are not long
on earth, we do many evil deeds and say many evil words. So let us
all catch a favorable moment when we are all together to say a
good word to each other. That's what I am doing: while I am in
this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for nothing is
this tribune given us by the highest authority&mdash;all Russia hears us!
<pb n='843'/><anchor id='Pg843'/>
I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud
to all fathers: <q>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.</q> Yes,
let us first fulfill Christ's injunction ourselves and only then venture
to expect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but
enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies,
and we have made them our enemies ourselves. <q>What measure
ye mete it shall be measured unto you again</q>&mdash;it's not I who say that,
it's the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they measure
to you. How can we blame children if they measure us according
to our measure?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having
secretly given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of
which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft,
behind some bricks. It was opened and inside was found the body
of a new-born child which she had killed. In the same box were
found the skeletons of two other babies which, according to her own
confession, she had killed at the moment of their birth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She
gave birth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would
any one venture to give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be
bold, gentlemen, let us be audacious even: it's our duty to be so at
this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like
the Moscow women in Ostrovsky's play, who are scared at the sound
of certain words. No, let us prove that the progress of the last few
years has touched even us, and let us say plainly, the father is not
merely he who begets the child, but he who begets it and does his
duty by it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other interpretation
of the word <q>father,</q> which insists that any father, even
though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children,
still remains my father simply because he begot me. But this
is, so to say, the mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend
with my intellect, but can only accept by faith, or, better to say,
<emph>on faith</emph>, like many other things which I do not understand, but
which religion bids me believe. But in that case let it be kept outside
the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of actual life, which
has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us great duties and
obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be humane&mdash;Christian, in
<pb n='844'/><anchor id='Pg844'/>
fact&mdash;we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions justified by
reason and experience, which have been passed through the crucible
of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though in
dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not
ill-treat and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not
only mystic, but rational and philanthropic....</q>

There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of
the court, but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring
them to let him finish without interruption. The court relapsed
into silence at once. The orator went on.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up
and begin to reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot,
and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction. The
sight of an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting
questions to a young creature, especially when he compares him with
the excellent fathers of his companions. The conventional answer
to this question is: <q>He begot you, and you are his flesh and blood,
and therefore you are bound to love him.</q> The youth involuntarily
reflects: <q>But did he love me when he begot me?</q> he asks, wondering
more and more. <q>Was it for my sake he begot me? He did not
know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,
perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me
a propensity to drunkenness&mdash;that's all he's done for me.... Why
am I bound to love him simply for begetting me when he has cared
nothing for me all my life after?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but
do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. <q>Drive
nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window,</q> and, above
all, let us not be afraid of words, but decide the question according
to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas.
How shall it be decided? Why, like this. Let the son stand before
his father and ask him, <q>Father, tell me, why must I love you?
Father, show me that I must love you,</q> and if that father is able
to answer him and show him good reason, we have a real, normal,
parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on a rational,
responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he does
not, there's an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him,
and the son has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even
<pb n='845'/><anchor id='Pg845'/>
an enemy. Our tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a
school of true and sound ideas.</q>

(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost
frantic applause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a
good half of it applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded.
Shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery,
where the ladies were sitting. Handkerchiefs were waved. The
President began ringing his bell with all his might. He was obviously
irritated by the behavior of the audience, but did not venture
to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of high position,
old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially reserved
seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their handkerchiefs.
So that when the noise died down, the President confined
himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and Fetyukovitch,
excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which
so much has been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and
