</p>

<p>
He turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change&mdash;two
pieces of twenty copecks&mdash;he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket.
They counted the money, which amounted to eight hundred and
thirty-six roubles, and forty copecks.
</p>

<p>
<q>And is that all?</q> asked the investigating lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred
roubles at Plotnikovs'. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver
twenty, here you lost two hundred, then....</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily.
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning.
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.
</p>

<p>
<q>With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred
at first?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose so,</q> snapped Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>How is it they all assert there was much more?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let them assert it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you asserted it yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I did, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not
yet examined. Don't be anxious about your money. It will be
properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ...
what is beginning ... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved
that you have undisputed right to it. Well, and now....</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya
firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and
thorough search <q>of your clothes and everything else....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means, gentlemen. I'll turn out all my pockets, if you
like.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.
</p>

<p>
<q>It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='543'/><anchor id='Pg543'/>

<p>
<q>What! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Won't you search me as I
am! Can't you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take
off your clothes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As you like,</q> Mitya submitted gloomily; <q>only, please, not here,
but behind the curtains. Who will search them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behind the curtains, of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face
wore an expression of peculiar solemnity.

<head>Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya</head>

<p>
Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed.
He could never, even a minute before, have conceived that
any one could behave like that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What
was worst of all, there was something humiliating in it, and on their
side something <q>supercilious and scornful.</q> It was nothing to take
off his coat, but he was asked to undress further, or rather not
asked but <q>commanded,</q> he quite understood that. From pride
and contempt he submitted without a word. Several peasants accompanied
the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain.
<q>To be ready if force is required,</q> thought Mitya, <q>and perhaps
for some other reason, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, must I take off my shirt, too?</q> he asked sharply, but
Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with
the prosecutor in examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat
and the cap; and it was evident that they were both much interested
in the scrutiny. <q>They make no bones about it,</q> thought
Mitya, <q>they don't keep up the most elementary politeness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I ask you for the second time&mdash;need I take off my shirt or not?</q>
he said, still more sharply and irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so
it seemed to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the
<pb n='544'/><anchor id='Pg544'/>
lawyers. There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left
side at the back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There
were bloodstains on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover,
in the presence of the peasant witnesses, passed his fingers
along the collar, the cuffs, and all the seams of the coat and
trousers, obviously looking for something&mdash;money, of course. He
didn't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of
sewing money up in his clothes.
</p>

<p>
<q>He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,</q> Mitya muttered
to himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with
amazing frankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind
the curtain, fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch's
attention to the cap, which they were also fingering.
</p>

<p>
<q>You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,</q> observed the
secretary. <q>Last summer he received the wages of the whole office,
and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk. And
where was it found? Why, in just such pipings in his cap. The
hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the
piping.</q>
</p>

<p>
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko's case perfectly, and so
laid aside Mitya's cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more
thoroughly examined later.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me,</q> cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing
that the right cuff of Mitya's shirt was turned in, and covered with
blood, <q>excuse me, what's that, blood?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Mitya jerked out.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking
after Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing
his hands at Perhotin's.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must take off your shirt, too. That's very important as
material evidence.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.
</p>

<p>
<q>What, am I to stay naked?</q> he shouted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile
take off your socks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're not joking? Is that really necessary?</q> Mitya's eyes
flashed.
</p>

<pb n='545'/><anchor id='Pg545'/>

<p>
<q>We are in no mood for joking,</q> answered Nikolay Parfenovitch
sternly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if I must&mdash;</q> muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed,
he took off his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were
clothed, while he was naked, and strange to say, when he was undressed
he felt somehow guilty in their presence, and was almost
ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them, and that now
they had a perfect right to despise him.
</p>

<p>
<q>When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when
one's the only one undressed and everybody is looking, it's degrading,</q>
he kept repeating to himself, again and again. <q>It's like a
dream, I've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions.</q>
It was a misery to him to take off his socks. They were very dirty,
and so were his underclothes, and now every one could see it. And
what was worse, he disliked his feet. All his life he had thought
both his big toes hideous. He particularly loathed the coarse, flat,
crooked nail on the right one, and now they would all see it. Feeling
intolerably ashamed made him, at once and intentionally, rougher.
He pulled off his shirt, himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Would you like to look anywhere else if you're not ashamed to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there's no need to, at present.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, am I to stay naked like this?</q> he added savagely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that can't be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down
here for a while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed,
and I ... I'll see to all this.</q>
</p>

<p>
All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the
search was drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and
the clothes were carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went
out, too. Mitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in
silence, never taking their eyes off him. Mitya wrapped himself up
in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet stuck out, and he
couldn't pull the quilt over so as to cover them. Nikolay Parfenovitch
seemed to be gone a long time, <q>an insufferable time.</q> <q>He
thinks of me as a puppy,</q> thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth. <q>That
rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts
him to see me naked!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined
and returned to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay
<pb n='546'/><anchor id='Pg546'/>
Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes, brought in
behind him by a peasant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here are clothes for you,</q> he observed airily, seeming well
satisfied with the success of his mission. <q>Mr. Kalganov has kindly
provided these for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt.
Luckily he had them all in his trunk. You can keep your own
socks and underclothes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya flew into a passion.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have other people's clothes!</q> he shouted menacingly,
<q>give me my own!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's impossible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they
succeeded somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon
him that his clothes, being stained with blood, must be <q>included
with the other material evidence,</q> and that they <q>had not even the
right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the
possible outcome of the case.</q> Mitya at last understood this. He
subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. He
merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes were much
better than his old ones, and that he disliked <q>gaining by the
change.</q> The coat was, besides, <q>ridiculously tight. Am I to be
dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?</q>
</p>

<p>
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov
was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a
little too long. But the coat turned out to be really tight in the
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn it all! I can hardly button it,</q> Mitya grumbled. <q>Be
so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his
clothes, and it's not my doing that they've dressed me up like a
clown.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend
you his clothes, but sorry about all this business,</q> mumbled Nikolay
Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting
here?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was asked to go back to the <q>other room.</q> Mitya went in,
scowling with anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one.
<pb n='547'/><anchor id='Pg547'/>
Dressed in another man's clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in
the eyes of the peasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face
appeared, for some reason, in the doorway, and vanished immediately.
<q>He's come to look at me dressed up,</q> thought Mitya. He
sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd nightmarish
feeling, as though he were out of his mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's
left for you,</q> he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor.
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he
disdained to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out
on purpose to show every one how dirty they were&mdash;the scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,</q> observed
Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's question.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on
something.
</p>

<p>
<q>We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
Nikolay Parfenovitch went on, <q>but having received from
you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source
from which you obtained the money found upon you, we are, at
the present moment&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the stone in your ring?</q> Mitya interrupted suddenly, as
though awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three
large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ring?</q> repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins
in it, what stone is that?</q> Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a smoky topaz,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling.
<q>Would you like to look at it? I'll take it off ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, don't take it off,</q> cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking
up, and angry with himself. <q>Don't take it off ... there's no
need.... Damn it!... Gentlemen, you've sullied my heart!
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you, if I had really
killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie, and hide myself? No,
that's not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldn't do, and if I were
guilty, I swear I shouldn't have waited for your coming, or for the
sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself before this,
without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I
<pb n='548'/><anchor id='Pg548'/>
couldn't have learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in
this accursed night!... And should I have been like this on this
night, and at this moment, sitting with you, could I have talked
like this, could I have moved like this, could I have looked at you
and at the world like this, if I had really been the murderer of my
father, when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory
gave me no peace all night&mdash;not from fear&mdash;oh, not simply from
fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And you expect me
to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe
in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty
thing I've done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from
your accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the
door to my father and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed
him. Who was he? I'm racking my brains and can't think who.
But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can
tell you, and that's enough, enough, leave me alone.... Exile me,
punish me, but don't bother me any more. I'll say no more. Call
your witnesses!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined
to be absolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor
watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking,
observed, as though it were the most ordinary thing, with the most
frigid and composed air:
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may
as well inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of
evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has
been given us by Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery,
he clearly and emphatically stated, in reply to our questions,
that when, on coming out to the steps, and hearing a noise in the
garden, he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate
which stood open, before he noticed you running, as you have told
us already, in the dark from the open window where you saw your
father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while noticing the open
window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him, the door,
standing wide open&mdash;that door which you have stated to have been
shut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from
you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that
you must have run from that door, though, of course, he did not see
<pb n='549'/><anchor id='Pg549'/>
you do so with his own eyes, since he only noticed you first some
distance away in the garden, running towards the fence.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q> he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, <q>it's a barefaced lie.
He couldn't have seen the door open because it was shut. He's
lying!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement.
He does not waver. He adheres to it. We've cross-examined
him several times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times,</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch confirmed warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's false, false! It's either an attempt to slander me, or the
hallucination of a madman,</q> Mitya still shouted. <q>He's simply raving,
from loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it
when he came to.... He's raving.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after
his injuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from
the lodge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it's false, it's false! It can't be so! He's slandering me
from spite.... He couldn't have seen it ... I didn't come from
the door,</q> gasped Mitya.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him
impressively:
</p>

<p>
<q>Confront him with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you recognize this object?</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official
envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope
was empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with
open eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>It ... it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope
that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there's inscribed
on it, allow me, <q>For my little chicken</q> ... yes&mdash;three
thousand!</q> he shouted, <q>do you see, three thousand, do you see?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was
empty, and lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.</q>
</p>

<p>
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, it's Smerdyakov!</q> he shouted suddenly, at the top
of his voice. <q>It's he who's murdered him! He's robbed him! No
<pb n='550'/><anchor id='Pg550'/>
one else knew where the old man hid the envelope. It's Smerdyakov,
that's clear, now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the
pillow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never knew it. I've never seen it. This is the first time I've
looked at it. I'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was
the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn't
know ...</q> Mitya was completely breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased
father's pillow. You especially stated that it was under the
pillow, so you must have known it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We've got it written down,</q> confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense! It's absurd! I'd no idea it was under the pillow.
And perhaps it wasn't under the pillow at all.... It was just a
chance guess that it was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov
say? Have you asked him where it was? What does Smerdyakov
say? that's the chief point.... And I went out of my way to
tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinking that it
was under the pillow, and now you&mdash; Oh, you know how one says
the wrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov,
only Smerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn't even tell
me where it was! But it's his doing, his doing; there's no doubt
about it, he murdered him, that's as clear as daylight now,</q> Mitya
exclaimed more and more frantically, repeating himself incoherently,
and growing more and more exasperated and excited. <q>You must
understand that, and arrest him at once.... He must have killed
him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious,
that's clear now.... He gave the signal and father opened to him ...
for no one but he knew the signal, and without the signal
father would never have opened the door....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you're again forgetting the circumstance,</q> the prosecutor
observed, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note
of triumph, <q>that there was no need to give the signal if the door
already stood open when you were there, while you were in the
garden....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The door, the door,</q> muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless
at the prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were
silent.
</p>

<pb n='551'/><anchor id='Pg551'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, the door!... It's a nightmare! God is against me!</q> he
exclaimed, staring before him in complete stupefaction.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, you see,</q> the prosecutor went on with dignity, <q>and you
can judge for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we
have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out, a fact
which overwhelms you and us. On the other side your incomprehensible,
persistent, and, so to speak, obdurate silence with regard
to the source from which you obtained the money which was so
suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours earlier, on your
own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles!
In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we
to believe, and what can we depend upon? And don't accuse us
of being <q>frigid, cynical, scoffing people,</q> who are incapable of believing
in the generous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter
into our position ...</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well!</q> he exclaimed suddenly. <q>I will tell you my secret.
I'll tell you where I got the money!... I'll reveal my shame, that
I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch,
in a voice of almost pathetic delight, <q>that every sincere and
complete confession on your part at this moment may, later on,
have an immense influence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and
he checked himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.

<head>Chapter VII. Mitya's Great Secret. Received With Hisses</head>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he began, still in the same agitation, <q>I
want to make a full confession: that money was <emph>my own</emph>.</q>
The lawyers' faces lengthened. That was not at all what they
expected.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean?</q> faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, <q>when at
five o'clock on the same day, from your own confession&mdash;</q>
</p>

<pb n='552'/><anchor id='Pg552'/>

<p>
<q>Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession!
That's nothing to do with it now! That money was my own, my
own, that is, stolen by me ... not mine, I mean, but stolen by
me, and it was fifteen hundred roubles, and I had it on me all the
time, all the time ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But where did you get it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was
here, round my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I'd had it round my
neck a long time, it's a month since I put it round my neck ...
to my shame and disgrace!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And from whom did you ... appropriate it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean, <q>steal it</q>? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider
that I practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I <q>appropriated it.</q> I
consider I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Last night? But you said that it's a month since you ...
obtained it?...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don't be
uneasy. I didn't steal it from my father, but from her. Let me
tell you without interrupting. It's hard to do, you know. You see,
a month ago, I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my
betrothed. Do you know her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you know her. She's a noble creature, noblest of the
noble. But she has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ...
and hated me with good reason, good reason!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna!</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder.
The prosecutor, too, stared.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, don't take her name in vain! I'm a scoundrel to bring her
into it. Yes, I've seen that she hated me ... a long while....
From the very first, even that evening at my lodging ... but
enough, enough. You're unworthy even to know of that. No need
of that at all.... I need only tell you that she sent for me
a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister
and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldn't have sent
it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in my
life when I ... well, in fact, when I'd just come to love another,
her, she's sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off
here to Mokroe then, and wasted here in two days half that damned
<pb n='553'/><anchor id='Pg553'/>
three thousand, but the other half I kept on me. Well, I've kept
that other half, that fifteen hundred, like a locket round my neck,
but yesterday I undid it, and spent it. What's left of it, eight hundred
roubles, is in your hands now, Nikolay Parfenovitch. That's
the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me. How's that? Why, when you were here a month
ago you spent three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows
that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one
count it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you told every one yourself that you'd spent exactly three
thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town
said so. And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three
thousand. Yet I didn't spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred.
And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. That's how
it was, gentlemen. That's where I got that money yesterday....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is almost miraculous,</q> murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to inquire,</q> observed the prosecutor at last, <q>have
you informed any one whatever of this circumstance before, I
mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I told no one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What was your reason for this reticence? What was your
motive for making such a secret of it? To be more precise: You
have told us at last your secret, in your words, so <q>disgraceful,</q>
though in reality&mdash;that is, of course, comparatively speaking&mdash;this
action, that is, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging
to some one else, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at
least, only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful,
when one takes into consideration your character.... Even admitting
that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable, still,
discreditable is not <q>disgraceful.</q>... Many people have already
guessed, during this last month, about the three thousand of Katerina
Ivanovna's, that you have spent, and I heard the legend myself, apart
from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for instance, had
heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but the gossip
<pb n='554'/><anchor id='Pg554'/>
of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am not mistaken,
that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the money
was Katerina Ivanovna's, and so, it's extremely surprising to me that
hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an
extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by,
apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret....
It's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to
confess such a secret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia
would be better than confessing it ...</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not
conceal his vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all
his accumulated spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without
choosing words.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not the fifteen hundred that's the disgrace, but that I put
it apart from the rest of the three thousand,</q> said Mitya firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why?</q> smiled the prosecutor irritably. <q>What is there disgraceful,
to your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three
thousand you had discreditably, if you prefer, <q>disgracefully,</q> appropriated?
Your taking the three thousand is more important than
what you did with it. And by the way, why did you do that&mdash;why
did you set apart that half, for what purpose, for what object did
you do it? Can you explain that to us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!</q> cried Mitya. <q>I
put it aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and
to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has
been going on a whole month.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's incomprehensible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wonder at you. But I'll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is
incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate
three thousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I
spend it all, and next morning I go to her and say, <q>Katya, I've done
wrong, I've squandered your three thousand,</q> well, is that right?
No, it's not right&mdash;it's dishonest and cowardly, I'm a beast, with no
more self-control than a beast, that's so, isn't it? But still I'm not a
thief? Not a downright thief, you'll admit! I squandered it, but
I didn't steal it. Now a second, rather more favorable alternative:
follow me carefully, or I may get confused again&mdash;my head's going
round&mdash;and so, for the second alternative: I spend here only fifteen
<pb n='555'/><anchor id='Pg555'/>
hundred out of the three thousand, that is, only half. Next day I
go and take that half to her: <q>Katya, take this fifteen hundred from
me, I'm a low beast, and an untrustworthy scoundrel, for I've wasted
half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so keep me from temptation!</q>
Well, what of that alternative? I should be a beast and a
scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not altogether
a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but have
kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back
half, I should pay back what I'd spent, that I should never give up
trying to, that I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that
case I should be a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what
you like, not a thief!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I admit that there is a certain distinction,</q> said the prosecutor,
with a cold smile. <q>But it's strange that you see such a vital difference.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel,
and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a
thief, it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don't
know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower
than a scoundrel, that's my conviction. Listen, I carry the money
about me a whole month, I may make up my mind to give it back
to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer, but I cannot make up
my mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day, and
every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month
I can't bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking,
is that right?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, that's not right, that I can quite understand, and that
I don't dispute,</q> answered the prosecutor with reserve. <q>And let
us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if
you will be so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that
you have still not told us, altogether we've asked you, why, in the
first place, you halved the money, squandering one half and hiding
the other? For what purpose exactly did you hide it, what did you
mean to do with that fifteen hundred? I insist upon that question,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course!</q> cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead;
<q>forgive me, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief
point, or you'd understand in a minute, for it's just the motive of
<pb n='556'/><anchor id='Pg556'/>
it that's the disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man,
my dead father. He was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna,
and I was jealous; I thought then that she was hesitating between me
and him. So I kept thinking every day, suppose she were to make
up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she were to leave off tormenting
me, and were suddenly to say to me, <q>I love you, not him; take
me to the other end of the world.</q> And I'd only forty copecks; how
could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I'd be lost. You
see, I didn't know her then, I didn't understand her, I thought she
wanted money, and that she wouldn't forgive my poverty. And so
I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it
up, calculating on it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had
sewn it up, I went off to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base.
Do you understand now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Both the lawyers laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to
have squandered it all,</q> chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, <q>for after
all what does it amount to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to! Oh, God, you
horrify me by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen
hundred sewn up round my neck, every day and every hour I said
to myself, <q>You're a thief! you're a thief!</q> Yes, that's why I've been
so savage all this month, that's why I fought in the tavern, that's
why I attacked my father, it was because I felt I was a thief. I
couldn't make up my mind, I didn't dare even to tell Alyosha, my
brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel
and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried it I said
to myself at the same time every hour: <q>No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
you may yet not be a thief.</q> Why? Because I might go next day
and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday
I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from
Fenya's to Perhotin. I hadn't been able till that moment to bring
myself to it. And it was only when I tore it off that I became a
downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life.
Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to
Katya and saying, <q>I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief!</q> Do you understand
now? Do you understand?</q>
</p>

<pb n='557'/><anchor id='Pg557'/>

<p>
<q>What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch interrupted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to
die at five o'clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made
no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see
it's not so, it turns out that it does make a difference. Believe me,
gentlemen, what has tortured me most during this night has not
been the thought that I'd killed the old servant, and that I was in
danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded, and Heaven
was open to me again. Oh, that did torture me, but not in the same
way: not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that
damned money off my breast at last and spent it, and had become a
downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you again, with a bleeding
heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I have learnt that it's
not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but impossible to die a
scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in
spite of his being intensely excited.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> the
prosecutor said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone.
<q>But all this, if you'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves,
in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves, that's what it is.
And why, for instance, should you not have saved yourself such
misery for almost a month, by going and returning that fifteen
hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you? And why could
you not have explained things to her, and in view of your position,
which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had
recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to
one's mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her,
why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for
your expenses, which, with her generous heart, she would certainly
not have refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with
some guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant
Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I suppose you still
regard that security as of value?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly crimsoned.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as
that? You can't be speaking in earnest?</q> he said, with indignation,
<pb n='558'/><anchor id='Pg558'/>
looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to
believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you I'm in earnest.... Why do you imagine I'm not
serious?</q> It was the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know,
you are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I'll
confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and
you'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which
a medley of human passions can sink. You must know that I already
had that plan myself, that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor!
Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this
current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya&mdash;I
was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to tell her of my
treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out, for the expenses
of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to beg,
do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the
other, the rival, who hated and insulted her&mdash;to think of it! You
must be mad, prosecutor!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ...
of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this
case, as you assert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,</q>
said the prosecutor, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>But that would have been so infamous!</q> Mitya brought his
fist down on the table fiercely. <q>That would have been filthy beyond
everything! Yes, do you know that she might have given me
that money, yes, and she would have given it, too; she'd have been
certain to give it, to be revenged on me, she'd have given it to
satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me, for hers is an
infernal nature, too, and she's a woman of great wrath. I'd have
taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have
taken it, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive
me, gentlemen, I'm making such an outcry because I've had that
thought in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday, that
night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards
yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till what happened?</q> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively,
but Mitya did not hear it.
</p>

<pb n='559'/><anchor id='Pg559'/>

<p>
<q>I have made you an awful confession,</q> Mitya said gloomily in
conclusion. <q>You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must
respect it, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then you've
simply no respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die
of shame at having confessed it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot
myself! Yes, I see, I see already that you don't believe me. What,
you want to write that down, too?</q> he cried in dismay.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what you said just now,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking
at him in surprise, <q>that is, that up to the last hour you were still
contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from
her.... I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence
for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and
particularly for you, particularly important for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have mercy, gentlemen!</q> Mitya flung up his hands. <q>Don't
write that, anyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart
asunder before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering
the wounds in both halves.... Oh, my God!</q>
</p>

<p>
In despair he hid his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> observed the
prosecutor, <q>everything that is written down will be read over to
you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you like.
But now I'll ask you one little question for the second time. Has no
one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed
up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to believe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one, no one, I told you so before, or you've not understood
anything! Let me alone!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's
plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a
dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted
almost everywhere about the three thousand you'd spent here;
three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you got
hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to
understand that you had brought three thousand with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred
witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!</q>
cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word <emph>all</emph> means
something.</q>
</p>

<pb n='560'/><anchor id='Pg560'/>

<p>
<q>It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what need had you to <q>talk rot,</q> as you call it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted
so much money.... To try and forget that money I had sewn
up, perhaps ... yes, that was why ... damn it ... how often
will you ask me that question? Well, I told a fib, and that was
the end of it, once I'd said it, I didn't care to correct it. What does
a man tell lies for sometimes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes
a man tell lies,</q> observed the prosecutor impressively. <q>Tell me,
though, was that <q>amulet,</q> as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not big.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How big, for instance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the
size.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them
somewhere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck?
According to your own evidence you didn't go home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I
tore it off my neck and took out the money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the dark?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in
one minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Without scissors, in the street?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an
old rag. It was torn in a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did you put it afterwards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I dropped it there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where was it, exactly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows
whereabouts. What do you want to know for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would
be material evidence in your favor. How is it you don't understand
that? Who helped you to sew it up a month ago?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one helped me. I did it myself.</q>
</p>

<pb n='561'/><anchor id='Pg561'/>

<p>
<q>Can you sew?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed
to do that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you
sewed the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you laughing at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know where I got the rag from&mdash;somewhere, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have thought you couldn't have forgotten it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word, I don't remember. I might have torn a bit off
my linen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow
the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag.
What sort of rag was it, cloth or linen?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe
I didn't tear it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe
I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady's.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In your landlady's cap?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I took it from her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How did you get it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to
wipe my pen on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless
rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it.
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece of
calico, washed a thousand times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you remember that for certain now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap.
But, hang it, what does it matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was
lost?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you,
an old rag not worth a farthing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where did you get the needle and thread?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!</q> said Mitya,
losing his temper at last.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where
you threw the pieces in the market-place.</q>
</p>

<pb n='562'/><anchor id='Pg562'/>

<p>
<q>Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and
perhaps you'll find it,</q> said Mitya, sneering. <q>Enough, gentlemen,
enough!</q> he decided, in an exhausted voice. <q>I see you don't believe
me! Not for a moment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not to
have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing
my secret to you? It's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes.
You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a hymn of triumph if you
can.... Damn you, you torturers!</q>
</p>

<p>
He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were
silent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost
vacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and
he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was
happening. In the meantime they had to finish what they were
about. They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It
was by now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had been
extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who
had been continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation
had been going on, had now both gone out again. The
lawyers, too, looked very tired. It was a wretched morning, the
whole sky was overcast, and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls.
Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I look out of the window?</q> he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch,
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, as much as you like,</q> the latter replied.
</p>

<p>
Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed
against its little greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just
below the house, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of
poor, black, dismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the
rain. Mitya thought of <q>Phœbus the golden-haired,</q> and how he
had meant to shoot himself at his first ray. <q>Perhaps it would be
even better on a morning like this,</q> he thought with a smile, and
suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his <q>torturers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he cried, <q>I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me
about her, I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me?
She's innocent, you know, she was out of her mind when she cried
last night <q>It's all my fault!</q> She's done nothing, nothing! I've
been grieving over her all night as I sat with you.... Can't you,
won't you tell me what you are going to do with her now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='563'/><anchor id='Pg563'/>

<p>
<q>You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch,</q> the prosecutor answered at once, with evident
alacrity. <q>We have, so far, no grounds for interfering with the
lady in whom you are so interested. I trust that it may be the same
in the later development of the case.... On the contrary, we'll do
everything that lies in our power in that matter. Set your mind
completely at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward
people in spite of everything. You've taken a load off my
heart.... Well, what are we to do now? I'm ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the
witnesses without delay. That must be done in your presence and
therefore&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't we have some tea first?</q> interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch,
<q>I think we've deserved it!</q>
</p>

<p>
They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch
had, no doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a
glass and then <q>go on and on,</q> putting off their proper breakfast
until a more favorable opportunity. Tea really was ready below,
and was soon brought up. Mitya at first refused the glass that
Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him, but afterwards he asked
for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked surprisingly exhausted.
It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength
that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent
emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he
could hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects
about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. <q>A little
more and I shall begin raving,</q> he said to himself.

<head>Chapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The Babe</head>

<p>
The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue
our story in such detail as before. And so we will not
dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness
called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and
<pb n='564'/><anchor id='Pg564'/>
conscience, and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence
on oath, how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of
his evidence, and so on. We will only note that the point principally
insisted upon in the examination was the question of the
three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here, at Mokroe,
by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand or
fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen
hundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned
out to be against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some
witnesses introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of
his, Mitya's, story.
</p>

<p>
The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not
in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the
contrary, an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused,
which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity.
He spoke little, and with reserve, waited to be questioned, answered
precisely and deliberately. Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness
that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than
three thousand, that all the peasants about here would testify that
they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by Dmitri
Fyodorovitch himself. <q>What a lot of money he flung away on
the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them
alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't believe I gave them five hundred,</q> was Mitya's gloomy
comment on this. <q>It's a pity I didn't count the money at the
time, but I was drunk....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He
listened gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though
he would say:
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly. <q>You flung it about at random
and they picked it up. They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers,
they've been driven away from here, or maybe they'd bear
witness themselves how much they got from you. I saw the sum
in your hands, myself&mdash;count it I didn't, you didn't let me, that's
true enough&mdash;but by the look of it I should say it was far more than
<pb n='565'/><anchor id='Pg565'/>
fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! We've seen money
too. We can judge of amounts....</q>
</p>

<p>
As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had told him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three
thousand with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?</q> replied Mitya.
<q>Surely I didn't declare so positively that I'd brought three thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey.
Andrey himself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when
you were treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you
would leave your sixth thousand here&mdash;that is with what you spent
before, we must understand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and
Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too, was standing beside you at the time.
Maybe he'd remember it....</q>
</p>

<p>
The evidence as to the <q>sixth</q> thousand made an extraordinary
impression on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new
mode of reckoning; three and three made six, three thousand then
and three now made six, that was clear.
</p>

<p>
They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch,
Stepan and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The
peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch's
evidence. They noted down, with particular care, Andrey's
account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the road:
<q><q>Where,</q> says he, <q>am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going, to heaven or
to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle
smile, and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where
Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be <q>included in the case.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored,
and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met
them before in his life, though they were acquaintances whom he
had been meeting every day for a long time past. He began by
saying that <q>he knew nothing about it and didn't want to.</q> But it
appeared that he had heard of the <q>sixth</q> thousand, and he admitted
that he had been standing close by at the moment. As far
as he could see he <q>didn't know</q> how much money Mitya had in his
<pb n='566'/><anchor id='Pg566'/>
hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply
to reiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned
out, Mitya's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved,
and that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of
Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect, as though she
had been a lady of the best society, and did not once allow himself
to call her Grushenka. In spite of the young man's obvious repugnance
at giving evidence, Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great
length, and only from him learnt all the details of what made up
Mitya's <q>romance,</q> so to say, on that night. Mitya did not once
pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go, and he left
the room with unconcealed indignation.
</p>

<p>
The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed
in their room, they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of
the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that
they would certainly be sent for. They gave their evidence with
dignity, though not without some uneasiness. The little Pole turned
out to be a retired official of the twelfth class, who had served in
Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name was Mussyalovitch. Pan
Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist. Although
Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room
they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was
standing on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most
important person and in command, and addressed him at every word
as <q>Pan Colonel.</q> Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch
himself, they grasped that they had to address their answers
to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It turned out that they could speak
Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words. Of
his relations with Grushenka, past and present, Pan Mussyalovitch
spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at once and
declared that he would not allow the <q>scoundrel</q> to speak like that
in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the
word <q>scoundrel</q> and begged that it should be put down in the
protocol. Mitya fumed with rage.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And
put down, too, that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he's
a scoundrel!</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he
<pb n='567'/><anchor id='Pg567'/>
showed the most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly
reprimanding Mitya, he cut short all further inquiry into the
romantic aspect of the case, and hastened to pass to what was
essential. One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special
interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very room, Mitya had
tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him three thousand
roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down, and
the remaining two thousand three hundred <q>to be paid next day
in the town.</q> He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole
sum with him at Mokroe, but that his money was in the town.
Mitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure
to pay him the remainder next day in the town. But Pan Vrublevsky
confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after thinking for a moment
admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the Poles stated,
that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have said so.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It
seemed to establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base
this deduction on it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that
had come into Mitya's hands might really have been left somewhere
hidden in the town, or even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe.
This would explain the circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution,
that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya's hands.
This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which, insignificant
as it was, had hitherto told, to some extent, in Mitya's
favor. Now this one piece of evidence in his favor had broken
down. In answer to the prosecutor's inquiry, where he would have
got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he
himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently
replied that he had meant to offer the <q>little chap,</q> not
money, but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village
of Tchermashnya, those rights which he had already offered to
Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov. The prosecutor positively smiled
at the <q>innocence of this subterfuge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute
for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He certainly would have accepted it,</q> Mitya declared warmly.
<q>Why, look here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four
or six, for it. He would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on
<pb n='568'/><anchor id='Pg568'/>
to the job, and might have got, not three thousand, but the whole
property out of the old man.</q>
</p>

<p>
The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the
protocol in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The
incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay
Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them, as it was, and did not
want to worry them with trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a
foolish, drunken quarrel over cards. There had been drinking and
disorder enough, that night.... So the two hundred roubles remained
in the pockets of the Poles.
</p>

<p>
Then old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached
with little steps, looking very disheveled and depressed.
He had, all this time, taken refuge below with Grushenka, sitting
dumbly beside her, and <q>now and then he'd begin blubbering over
her and wiping his eyes with a blue check handkerchief,</q> as Mihail
Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she herself began trying
to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once confessed that he
had done wrong, that he had borrowed <q>ten roubles in my poverty,</q>
from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.
To Nikolay Parfenovitch's direct question, had he noticed how
much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have
been able to see the sum better than any one when he took the note
from him, Maximov, in the most positive manner, declared that there
was twenty thousand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?</q>
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged
my little property. She'd only let me look at it from a distance,
boasting of it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored
notes. And Dmitri Fyodorovitch's were all rainbow-colored....</q>
</p>

<p>
He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka's turn. Nikolay
Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance
might have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition
to him, but Mitya bowed his head in silence, giving him to
understand <q>that he would not make a scene.</q> Mihail Makarovitch
himself led Grushenka in. She entered with a stern and gloomy
face, that looked almost composed and sat down quietly on the
<pb n='569'/><anchor id='Pg569'/>
chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very pale, she
seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent
black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish chill&mdash;the
first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her
grave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very
favorable impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even
a little bit <q>fascinated.</q> He admitted himself, when talking about
it afterwards, that only then had he seen <q>how handsome the woman
was,</q> for, though he had seen her several times before, he had always
looked upon her as something of a <q>provincial hetaira.</q> <q>She
has the manners of the best society,</q> he said enthusiastically, gossiping
about her in a circle of ladies. But this was received with positive
indignation by the ladies, who immediately called him a
<q>naughty man,</q> to his great satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
As she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant
at Mitya, who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him
at once. After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay
Parfenovitch asked her, hesitating a little, but preserving the most
courteous manner, on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov. To this Grushenka firmly and
quietly replied:
</p>

<p>
<q>He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance
during the last month.</q> To further inquisitive questions she answered
plainly and with complete frankness, that, though <q>at times</q>
she had thought him attractive, she had not loved him, but had won
his heart as well as his old father's <q>in my nasty spite,</q> that she had
seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every
one else; but that had only amused her. She had never meant to go
to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been laughing at him. <q>I
had no thoughts for either of them all this last month. I was expecting
another man who had wronged me. But I think,</q> she said
in conclusion, <q>that there's no need for you to inquire about that,
nor for me to answer you, for that's my own affair.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He
again dismissed the <q>romantic</q> aspect of the case and passed to the
serious one, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning
the three thousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the statement
that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first
<pb n='570'/><anchor id='Pg570'/>
carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had not counted the money
herself, she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri
Fyodorovitch's own lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you
only hear him speak of it to others in your presence?</q> the prosecutor
inquired immediately.
</p>

<p>
