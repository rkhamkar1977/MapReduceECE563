In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in that human
shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteen centuries
ago. He came down to the <q>hot pavements</q> of the southern
town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, <foreign
lang='la' rend='italic'>ad majorem gloriam Dei</foreign>,
been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent
<foreign rend='italic'>auto da fé</foreign>, in the presence of the king, the
court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming ladies of the
court, and the whole population of Seville.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one
recognized Him. That might be one of the best passages in the
poem. I mean, why they recognized Him. The people are irresistibly
drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him,
follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile
of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, light
and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people,
stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands
to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact
with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd,
blind from childhood, cries out, <q>O Lord, heal me and I shall see
Thee!</q> and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man
sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet.
Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. <q>It is
He&mdash;it is He!</q> all repeat. <q>It must be He, it can be no one but
Him!</q> He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment
when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin.
In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent
citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. <q>He will raise your
child,</q> the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming
to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of
the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. <q>If it is Thou,
raise my child!</q> she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession
halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks
with compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, <q>Maiden,
arise!</q> and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and
looks round, smiling with wide-open wondering eyes, holding a
bunch of white roses they had put in her hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that
moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the
<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>
cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a
withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of
light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was
the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman
Church&mdash;at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old, monk's cassock.
At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and
slaves and the <q>holy guard.</q> He stops at the sight of the crowd and
watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the
coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens.
He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire.
He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is
his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and
trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes
way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay
hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down
to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the
people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to
the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy
Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed
by the dark, burning, <q>breathless</q> night of Seville. The air is <q>fragrant
with laurel and lemon.</q> In the pitch darkness the iron door
of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself
comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at
once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or
two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on
the table and speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Is it Thou? Thou?</q> but receiving no answer, he adds at once,
<q>Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know
too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add
anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou
come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou
knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be to-morrow? I
know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou
or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee
and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very
people who have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest
sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest
Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,</q> he added with thoughtful
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>
penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?</q> Alyosha,
who had been listening in silence, said with a smile. <q>Is it simply
a wild fantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man&mdash;some impossible
<foreign rend='italic'>quiproquo</foreign>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it as the last,</q> said Ivan, laughing, <q>if you are so corrupted
by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic. If
you like it to be a case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,</q>
he went on, laughing, <q>the old man was ninety, and he might well
be crazy over his set idea. He might have been struck by the appearance
of the Prisoner. It might, in fact, be simply his ravings,
the delusion of an old man of ninety, over-excited
by the <foreign rend='italic'>auto da fé</foreign>
of a hundred heretics the day before. But does it matter to us after
all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy? All that
matters is that the old man should speak out, should speak openly of
what he has thought in silence for ninety years.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not
say a word?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's inevitable in any case,</q> Ivan laughed again. <q>The old
man has told Him He hasn't the right to add anything to what He
has said of old. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of
Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. <q>All has been given by
Thee to the Pope,</q> they say, <q>and all, therefore, is still in the Pope's
hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all. Thou
must not meddle for the time, at least.</q> That's how they speak and
write too&mdash;the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read it myself in the
works of their theologians. <q>Hast Thou the right to reveal to us
one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come?</q>
my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. <q>No,
Thou hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said
of old, and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst
exalt when Thou wast on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew
will encroach on men's freedom of faith; for it will be manifest
as a miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than
anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago. Didst Thou not
often say then, <q>I will make you free</q>? But now Thou hast seen
these <q>free</q> men,</q> the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile.
<q>Yes, we've paid dearly for it,</q> he goes on, looking sternly at Him,
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>
<q>but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen
centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is
ended and over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over for
good? Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be
wroth with me. But let me tell Thee that now, to-day, people are
more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom, yet they
have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet.
But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst? Was this
Thy freedom?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand again,</q> Alyosha broke in. <q>Is he ironical, is
he jesting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his
Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done
so to make men happy. <q>For now</q> (he is speaking of the Inquisition,
of course) <q>for the first time it has become possible to think of the
happiness of men. Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels
be happy? Thou wast warned,</q> he says to Him. <q>Thou hast had
no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst not listen to
those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men
might be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst
hand on the work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established
by Thy word, Thou hast given to us the right to bind and
to unbind, and now, of course, Thou canst not think of taking it
away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder us?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what's the meaning of <q>no lack of admonitions and warnings</q>?</q>
asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and
non-existence,</q>
the old man goes on, <q rend='pre'>the great spirit talked with Thee in
the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he <q>tempted</q>
Thee. Is that so? And could anything truer be said than what he
revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject, and
what in the books is called <q>the temptation</q>? And yet if there
has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle, it took place on
that day, on the day of the three temptations. The statement of
those three questions was itself the miracle. If it were possible to
imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions
of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books, and that we
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>
had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to do so had gathered
together all the wise men of the earth&mdash;rulers, chief priests,
learned men, philosophers, poets&mdash;and had set them the task to invent
three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but
express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history
of the world and of humanity&mdash;dost Thou believe that all the
wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth
and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to
Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness? From
those questions alone, from the miracle of their statement, we can
see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence,
but with the absolute and eternal. For in those three questions the
whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together
into one whole, and foretold, and in them are united all the unsolved
historical contradictions of human nature. At the time it could not
be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that fifteen
hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three
questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly
fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>Judge Thyself who was right&mdash;Thou or he who questioned
Thee then? Remember the first question; its meaning, in other
words, was this: <q>Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going
with empty hands, with some promise of freedom which men in
their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand,
which they fear and dread&mdash;for nothing has ever been more insupportable
for a man and a human society than freedom. But seest
Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness? Turn
them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of
sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest Thou
withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.</q> But Thou wouldst
not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking,
what is that freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread?
Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou
know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth
will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome
Thee, and all will follow him, crying, <q>Who can compare with this
beast? He has given us fire from heaven!</q> Dost Thou know that
the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>
sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only
hunger? <q>Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!</q> that's what
they'll write on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and
with which they will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood
will rise a new building; the terrible tower of Babel will be built
again, and though, like the one of old, it will not be finished, yet
Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short
the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come back
to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower. They will
seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall
be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to us,
<q>Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't
given it!</q> And then we shall finish building their tower, for he
finishes the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them
in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never,
never can they feed themselves without us! No science will give
them bread so long as they remain free. In the end they will lay
their freedom at our feet, and say to us, <q>Make us your slaves, but
feed us.</q> They will understand themselves, at last, that freedom
and bread enough for all are inconceivable together, for never, never
will they be able to share between them! They will be convinced,
too, that they can never be free, for they are weak, vicious, worthless
and rebellious. Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven,
but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes
of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if for the
sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is
to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures
who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread
for the sake of the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens
of thousands of the great and strong, while the millions, numerous
as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love Thee, must exist only
for the sake of the great and strong? No, we care for the weak
too. They are sinful and rebellious, but in the end they too will
become obedient. They will marvel at us and look on us as gods, because
we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so
dreadful and to rule over them&mdash;so awful it will seem to them to be
free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule
them in Thy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
Thee come to us again. That deception will be our suffering, for we
shall be forced to lie.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>This is the significance of the first question in the
wilderness, and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom
which Thou hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies
hid the great secret of this world. Choosing <q>bread,</q> Thou wouldst
have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity&mdash;to
find some one to worship. So long as man remains free he strives
for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to
worship. But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute,
so that all men would agree at once to worship it. For these
pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other
can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and
worship; what is essential is that all may be <emph>together</emph> in it. This
craving for <emph>community</emph> of worship is the chief misery of every man
individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For
the sake of common worship they've slain each other with the
sword. They have set up gods and challenged one another, <q>Put
away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and
your gods!</q> And so it will be to the end of the world, even when
gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols
just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but have known,
this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject the
one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow
down to Thee alone&mdash;the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast
rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold
what Thou didst further. And all again in the name of freedom!
I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find
some one quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom
with which the ill-fated creature is born. But only one who can
appease their conscience can take over their freedom. In bread there
was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread, and man will
worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if some
one else gains possession of his conscience&mdash;oh! then he will cast
away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience.
In that Thou wast right. For the secret of man's being is
not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable
conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>
on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth,
though he had bread in abundance. That is true. But what happened?
Instead of taking men's freedom from them, Thou didst
make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man prefers
peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of
good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom
of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,
instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience
of man at rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional,
vague and enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond
the strength of men, acting as though Thou didst not love them at
all&mdash;Thou who didst come to give Thy life for them! Instead of
taking possession of men's freedom, Thou didst increase it, and burdened
the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever.
Thou didst desire man's free love, that he should follow Thee freely,
enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the rigid ancient
law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is
good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his
guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even
Thy image and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful
burden of free choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth
is not in Thee, for they could not have been left in greater confusion
and suffering than Thou hast caused, laying upon them so many
cares and unanswerable problems.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for
the destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it.
Yet what was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers
alone, able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience
of these impotent rebels for their happiness&mdash;those forces are miracle,
mystery and authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast
set the example for doing so. When the wise and dread spirit set
Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee, <q>If Thou
wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself
down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up lest he
fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou
art the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in
Thy Father.</q> But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself
down. Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and well, like God;
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>
but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods? Oh, Thou
didst know then that in taking one step, in making one movement
to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have
lost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces
against that earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise
spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are
there many like Thee? And couldst Thou believe for one moment
that men, too, could face such a temptation? Is the nature
of men such, that they can reject miracle, and at the great
moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing
spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?
Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books,
would be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the
earth, and Thou didst hope that man, following Thee, would cling
to God and not ask for a miracle. But Thou didst not know that
when man rejects miracle he rejects God too; for man seeks not so
much God as the miraculous. And as man cannot bear to be without
the miraculous, he will create new miracles of his own for himself,
and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft, though he
might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou
didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee,
mocking and reviling Thee, <q>Come down from the cross and we will
believe that Thou art He.</q> Thou didst not come down, for again
Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and didst crave faith
given freely, not based on miracle. Thou didst crave for free love
and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has
overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highly of men
therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by nature.
Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon
them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is
weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he,
can he do what Thou didst? By showing him so much respect,
Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him, for Thou didst ask far
too much from him&mdash;Thou who hast loved him more than Thyself!
Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less of him. That
would have been more like love, for his burden would have been
lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now
rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>
pride of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting
and barring out the teacher at school. But their childish delight will
end; it will cost them dear. They will cast down temples and
drench the earth with blood. But they will see at last, the foolish
children, that, though they are rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable
to keep up their own rebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears,
they will recognize at last that He who created them rebels must
have meant to mock at them. They will say this in despair, and
their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make them more
unhappy still, for man's nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in the
end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and
unhappiness&mdash;that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear
so much for their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in
image, that he saw all those who took part in the first resurrection
and that there were of each tribe twelve thousand. But if there
were so many of them, they must have been not men but gods.
They had borne Thy cross, they had endured scores of years in the
barren, hungry wilderness, living upon locusts and roots&mdash;and Thou
mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of
free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy name. But remember
that they were only some thousands; and what of the rest? And
how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not endure
what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that
it is unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply
come to the elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and
we cannot understand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right
to preach a mystery, and to teach them that it's not the free judgment
of their hearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which
they must follow blindly, even against their conscience. So we have
done. We have corrected Thy work and have founded it upon
<emph>miracle</emph>, <emph>mystery</emph> and <emph>authority</emph>. And men rejoiced
that they were again led like sheep, and that the terrible gift that had brought them
such suffering was, at last, lifted from their hearts. Were we right
teaching them this? Speak! Did we not love mankind, so meekly
acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly lightening their burden,
and permitting their weak nature even sin with our sanction? Why
hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look
silently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
don't want Thy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for
me to hide anything from Thee? Don't I know to Whom I am
speaking? All that I can say is known to Thee already. And is it
for me to conceal from Thee our mystery? Perhaps it is Thy will
to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not working with
Thee, but with <emph>him</emph>&mdash;that is our mystery. It's long&mdash;eight
centuries&mdash;since we have been on <emph>his</emph> side and not on Thine. Just
eight centuries ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn,
that last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of
the earth. We took from him Rome and the sword of Cæsar, and
proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth, though hitherto we
have not been able to complete our work. But whose fault is that?
Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has begun. It has long to
await completion and the earth has yet much to suffer, but we
shall triumph and shall be Cæsars, and then we shall plan the universal
happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then
the sword of Cæsar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst
Thou accepted that last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst
have accomplished all that man seeks on earth&mdash;that is, some one to
worship, some one to keep his conscience, and some means of uniting
all in one unanimous and harmonious ant-heap, for the craving
for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men. Mankind
as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state. There
have been many great nations with great histories, but the more
highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for they
felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide
union. The great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans,
whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue
its people, and they too were but the unconscious expression of the
same craving for universal unity. Hadst Thou taken the world and
Cæsar's purple, Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and
have given universal peace. For who can rule men if not he who
holds their conscience and their bread in his hands? We have taken
the sword of Cæsar, and in taking it, of course, have rejected Thee
and followed <emph>him</emph>. Oh, ages are yet to come of the confusion of
free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having begun
to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,
with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>
feet and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon
the beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written, <q>Mystery.</q>
But then, and only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come
for men. Thou art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the
elect, while we give rest to all. And besides, how many of those
elect, those mighty ones who could become elect, have grown weary
waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will transfer the powers
of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp, and
end by raising their <emph>free</emph> banner against Thee. Thou didst Thyself
lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will no
more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we
shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce
their freedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right
or shall we be lying? They will be convinced that we are right,
for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to
which Thy freedom brought them. Freedom, free thought and
science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face
to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of
them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious
but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and
unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: <q>Yes,
you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back
to you, save us from ourselves!</q></q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the
bread made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without
any miracle. They will see that we do not change the stones to
bread, but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from
our hands than for the bread itself! For they will remember only
too well that in old days, without our help, even the bread they
made turned to stones in their hands, while since they have come
back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in their hands.
Too, too well will they know the value of complete submission!
And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to
blame for their not knowing it?&mdash;speak! Who scattered the flock
and sent it astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come
together again and will submit once more, and then it will be once
for all. Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of
weak creatures such as they are by nature. Oh, we shall persuade
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>
them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst lift them up and
thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them that they
are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike
happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will
look to us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They
will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be
proud at our being so powerful and clever, that we have been able
to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions. They
will tremble impotently before our wrath, their minds will grow
fearful, they will be quick to shed tears like women and children,
but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter
and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes, we shall set
them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their life
like a child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance. Oh,
we shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they
will love us like children because we allow them to sin. We shall
tell them that every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission,
that we allow them to sin because we love them, and the
punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves. And we shall take
it upon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviors who have
taken on themselves their sins before God. And they will have no
secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them to live with their
wives and mistresses, to have or not to have children&mdash;according to
whether they have been obedient or disobedient&mdash;and they will submit
to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of their
conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer
for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will
save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure
at present in making a free decision for themselves. And all will be
happy, all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand
who rule over them. For only we, we who guard the mystery, shall
be unhappy. There will be thousands of millions of happy babes,
and a hundred thousand sufferers who have taken upon themselves
the curse of the knowledge of good and evil. Peacefully they will
die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and beyond the grave
they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the secret, and
for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven
and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world,
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
it certainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that
Thou wilt come again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen,
the proud and strong, but we will say that they have only saved
themselves, but we have saved all. We are told that the harlot
who sits upon the beast, and holds in her hands the <emph>mystery</emph>, shall
be put to shame, that the weak will rise up again, and will rend her
royal purple and will strip naked her loathsome body. But then I
will stand up and point out to Thee the thousand millions of happy
children who have known no sin. And we who have taken their
sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and say:
<q>Judge us if Thou canst and darest.</q> Know that I fear Thee not.
Know that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on
roots and locusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast
blessed men, and I too was striving to stand among Thy elect, among
the strong and powerful, thirsting <q>to make up the number.</q> But
I awakened and would not serve madness. I turned back and joined
the ranks of those <emph>who have corrected Thy work</emph>. I left the proud
and went back to the humble, for the happiness of the humble.
What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will be
built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock
who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about
the pile on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For
if any one has ever deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I
shall burn Thee. <hi rend='italic'>Dixi.</hi></q></q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with
excitement; when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly
moved and seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but
restrained himself. Now his words came with a rush.
</p>

<p>
<q>But ... that's absurd!</q> he cried, flushing. <q>Your poem is in
praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him&mdash;as you meant it to be. And
who will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand
it? That's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church....
That's Rome, and not even the whole of Rome, it's false&mdash;those are
the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!... And
there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor.
What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who are
these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>
for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen?
We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not
what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They
are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world
in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that's
their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about
it.... It's simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination&mdash;something
like a universal serfdom with them as masters&mdash;that's
all they stand for. They don't even believe in God perhaps.
Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, stay,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>how hot you are! A fantasy you
say, let it be so! Of course it's a fantasy. But allow me to say: do
you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last
centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly
gain? Is that Father Païssy's teaching?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, on the contrary, Father Païssy did once say something
rather the same as you ... but of course it's not the same, not a
bit the same,</q> Alyosha hastily corrected himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>A precious admission, in spite of your <q>not a bit the same.</q> I
ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile
material gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed
by great sorrow and loving humanity? You see, only suppose
that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing
but filthy material gain&mdash;if there's only one like my old
Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made
frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and perfect.
But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyes were
opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain
perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction
that millions of God's creatures have been created as a mockery,
that they will never be capable of using their freedom, that these
poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower, that
it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his dream
of harmony. Seeing all that he turned back and joined&mdash;the clever
people. Surely that could have happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Joined whom, what clever people?</q> cried Alyosha, completely
carried away. <q>They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries
and secrets.... Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
secret. Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, that's his secret!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It's perfectly
true, it's true that that's the whole secret, but isn't that suffering,
at least for a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the
desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity?
In his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the
advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of
life for the feeble, unruly, <q>incomplete, empirical creatures created
in jest.</q> And so, convinced of this, he sees that he must follow the
counsel of the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction,
and therefore accept lying and deception, and lead men consciously
to death and destruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that
they may not notice where they are being led, that the poor blind
creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy. And
note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose ideal the old
man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that tragic?
And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army <q>filled
with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain</q>&mdash;would not
one such be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such
standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of
the Roman Church with all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea.
I tell you frankly that I firmly believe that there has always been
such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement.
Who knows, there may have been some such even among the Roman
Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man
who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found
even now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by
chance but by agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for
the guarding of the mystery, to guard it from the weak and the
unhappy, so as to make them happy. No doubt it is so, and so it
must be indeed. I fancy that even among the Masons there's something
of the same mystery at the bottom, and that that's why the
Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity
of the idea, while it is so essential that there should be one flock
and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea I might
be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are perhaps a Mason yourself!</q> broke suddenly from
Alyosha. <q>You don't believe in God,</q> he added, speaking this time
<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>
very sorrowfully. He fancied besides that his brother was looking
at him ironically. <q>How does your poem end?</q> he asked, suddenly
looking down. <q>Or was it the end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking
he waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence
weighed down upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened
intently all the time, looking gently in his face and evidently not
wishing to reply. The old man longed for Him to say something,
however bitter and terrible. But He suddenly approached the
old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips.
That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His lips moved.
He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: <q>Go, and come
no more ... come not at all, never, never!</q> And he let Him out
into the dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the old man?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his
idea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you with him, you too?</q> cried Alyosha, mournfully.
</p>

<p>
Ivan laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's all nonsense, Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of a
senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do
you take it so seriously? Surely you don't suppose I am going
straight off to the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His
work? Good Lord, it's no business of mine. I told you, all I want
is to live on to thirty, and then ... dash the cup to the ground!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the
blue sky, and the woman you love! How will you live, how will
you love them?</q> Alyosha cried sorrowfully. <q>With such a hell in
your heart and your head, how can you? No, that's just what you
are going away for, to join them ... if not, you will kill yourself,
you can't endure it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a strength to endure everything,</q> Ivan said with a
cold smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>What strength?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The strength of the Karamazovs&mdash;the strength of the Karamazov
baseness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption,
yes?</q>
</p>

<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>

<p>
<q>Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall
escape it, and then&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That's
impossible with your ideas.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the Karamazov way, again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Everything is lawful,</q> you mean? Everything is lawful, is
that it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase, which so offended
Miüsov&mdash;and which Dmitri pounced upon so naïvely, and paraphrased!</q>
he smiled queerly. <q>Yes, if you like, <q>everything is lawful</q>
since the word has been said. I won't deny it. And Mitya's
version isn't bad.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked at him in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought that going away from here I have you at least,</q> Ivan
said suddenly, with unexpected feeling; <q>but now I see that there
is no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula,
<q>all is lawful,</q> I won't renounce&mdash;will you renounce me for that,
yes?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's plagiarism,</q> cried Ivan, highly delighted. <q>You stole
that from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it's time
we were going, both of us.</q>
</p>

<p>
They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of
the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, Alyosha,</q> Ivan began in a resolute voice, <q>if I am really
able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering
you. It's enough for me that you are somewhere here, and
I shan't lose my desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take
it as a declaration of love if you like. And now you go to the
right and I to the left. And it's enough, do you hear, enough. I
mean even if I don't go away to-morrow (I think I certainly shall
go) and we meet again, don't say a word more on these subjects.
I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you specially,
never speak to me again,</q> he added, with sudden irritation; <q>it's all
exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn't it? And
I'll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want
to <q>dash the cup to the ground,</q> wherever I may be I'll come to have
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
one more talk with you, even though it were from America, you
may be sure of that. I'll come on purpose. It will be very interesting
to have a look at you, to see what you'll be by that time. It's
rather a solemn promise, you see. And we really may be parting
for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he
is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry with me for
having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more; that's right, now
go.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back.
It was just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the
parting had been very different. The strange resemblance flashed
like an arrow through Alyosha's mind in the distress and dejection
of that moment. He waited a little, looking after his brother. He
suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right
shoulder looked lower than his left. He had never noticed it before.
But all at once he turned too, and almost ran to the monastery. It
was nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened; something new was
growing up in him for which he could not account. The wind had
risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines murmured
gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse.
He almost ran. <q>Pater Seraphicus&mdash;he got that name from somewhere&mdash;where
from?</q> Alyosha wondered. <q>Ivan, poor Ivan, and
when shall I see you again?... Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes,
that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he will save me&mdash;from him and for
ever!</q>
</p>

<p>
Several times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving
Ivan so completely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that
morning, only a few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him
and not to give up doing so, even should he be unable to return to
the monastery that night.

<head>Chapter VI. For Awhile A Very Obscure One</head>

<p>
And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's house. But, strange to say, he was overcome by
insufferable depression, which grew greater at every step he took
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>
towards the house. There was nothing strange in his being depressed;
what was strange was that Ivan could not have said what
was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before, and there
was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when
he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and
was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new,
unknown future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though
he had great hopes, and great&mdash;too great&mdash;expectations from life, he
could not have given any definite account of his hopes, his expectations,
or even his desires.
</p>

<p>
Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown
certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him
was something quite different. <q>Is it loathing for my father's
house?</q> he wondered. <q>Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though
it's the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it....
No, it's not that either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and
the conversation I had with him? For so many years I've been
silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and all of a
sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.</q> It certainly might have
been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity&mdash;vexation
at having failed to express himself, especially with such a
being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly been reckoning.
No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but
yet that was not it, that was not it either. <q>I feel sick with depression
and yet I can't tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan tried <q>not to think,</q> but that, too, was no use. What made
his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of
casual, external character&mdash;he felt that. Some person or thing
seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes
obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy
with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice
it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes,
and removes the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous
one&mdash;some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief
on the floor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on.
</p>

<p>
At last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home,
and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed
what was fretting and worrying him.
</p>

<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>

<p>
On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying
the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him
Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it
was this man that his soul loathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly
and became clear. Just before, when Alyosha had been telling
him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had felt a sudden twinge
of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred responsive
anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had been
forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as
soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten
sensation began to obtrude itself again. <q>Is it possible that
a miserable, contemptible creature like that can worry me so much?</q>
he wondered, with insufferable irritation.
</p>

<p>
It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike
for the man, especially during the last few days. He had even
begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of
hatred for the creature. Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by
the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighborhood he had felt
quite differently. Then he had taken a marked interest in Smerdyakov,
and had even thought him very original. He had encouraged
him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a certain
incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not understand
what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon
the brain of <q>the contemplative.</q> They discussed philosophical
questions and even how there could have been light on the first
day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created on the fourth
day, and how that was to be understood. But Ivan soon saw that,
though the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting subject, yet
that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov, and that he was looking
for something altogether different. In one way and another, he
began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too, and
that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later
on, there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on
the scene, and there had been the scandals with his brother Dmitri&mdash;they
discussed that, too. But though Smerdyakov always talked
of that with great excitement, it was impossible to discover what
he desired to come of it. There was, in fact, something surprising
in the illogicality and incoherence of some of his desires, accidentally
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
betrayed and always vaguely expressed. Smerdyakov was always
inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously premeditated questions,
but what his object was he did not explain, and usually at the
most important moment he would break off and relapse into silence
or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most
and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity
which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly.
Not that he forgot himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always
spoke very respectfully, yet he had obviously begun to consider&mdash;goodness
knows why!&mdash;that there was some sort of understanding
between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always spoke in a tone
that suggested that those two had some kind of compact, some secret
between them, that had at some time been expressed on both sides,
only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around
them. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of
his growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the
root of it.
</p>

<p>
With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at
the gate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov
rose from the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew
instantly that he wanted particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked
at him and stopped, and the fact that he did stop, instead of passing
by, as he meant to the minute before, drove him to fury. With
anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov's emasculate, sickly
face, with the little curls combed forward on his forehead. His
left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, <q>Where are you going?
You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have something
to say to each other.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan shook. <q>Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with
you?</q> was on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment
he heard himself say, <q>Is my father still asleep, or has he
waked?</q>
</p>

<p>
He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise,
and at once, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For
an instant he felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards.
Smerdyakov stood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking
at him with assurance and almost severity.
</p>

<p>
<q>His honor is still asleep,</q> he articulated deliberately (<q>You were
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
the first to speak, not I,</q> he seemed to say). <q>I am surprised at you,
sir,</q> he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his
right foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you surprised at me?</q> Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly,
doing his utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing,
with disgust, that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not,
on any account, have gone away without satisfying it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?</q> Smerdyakov suddenly
raised his eyes and smiled familiarly. <q>Why I smile you must
understand of yourself, if you are a clever man,</q> his screwed-up
left eye seemed to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should I go to Tchermashnya?</q> Ivan asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was silent again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,</q> he said at
last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his answer.
<q>I put you off with a secondary reason,</q> he seemed to suggest,
<q>simply to say something.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn you! Speak out what you want!</q> Ivan cried angrily
at last, passing from meekness to violence.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up,
but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Substantially nothing&mdash;but just by way of conversation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute.
Ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov
stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether
he would be angry or not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last
he moved to get up. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how
to help myself,</q> he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last
word he sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little
children,</q> Smerdyakov went on. <q>I am speaking of your parent
and your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch
will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute, <q>Has she
come? Why hasn't she come?</q> and so on up till midnight and even
after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn't come (for
very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he will be at me
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
again to-morrow morning, <q>Why hasn't she come? When will she
come?</q>&mdash;as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it's
no better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother
will appear with his gun in his hands: <q>Look out, you rogue, you
soup-maker. If you miss her and don't let me know she's been&mdash;I'll
kill you before any one.</q> When the night's over, in the morning,
he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death. <q>Why
hasn't she come? Will she come soon?</q> And he, too, thinks me to
blame because his lady hasn't come. And every day and every
hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall
kill myself in a fright. I can't depend upon them, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for
Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q> said Ivan irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven't meddled
at all, if you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet
from the very beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on
me to be his servant. He has had only one thing to say since: <q>I'll
kill you, you scoundrel, if you miss her,</q> I feel certain, sir, that I
shall have a long fit to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>a long fit</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A long fit, lasting a long time&mdash;several hours, or perhaps a day
or two. Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret
that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for
three days I couldn't come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch
sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head
and tried another remedy, too.... I might have died.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming.
What makes you say you will have one to-morrow?</q> Ivan inquired,
with a peculiar, irritable curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just so. You can't tell beforehand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Besides, you fell from the garret then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret
again to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps.
I have to go into the cellar every day, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took a long look at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand
you,</q> he said softly, but with a sort of menace. <q>Do you mean to
pretend to be ill to-morrow for three days, eh?</q>
</p>

<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>

<p>
Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing
with the toe of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one
forward, and, grinning, articulated:
</p>

<p>
<q>If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit&mdash;and
it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them&mdash;I
should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from
death. For even if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father
while I am ill, his honor can't blame a sick man for not telling him.
He'd be ashamed to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hang it all!</q> Ivan cried, his face working with anger, <q>why
are you always in such a funk for your life? All my brother
Dmitri's threats are only hasty words and mean nothing. He won't
kill you; it's not you he'll kill!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He'd kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that,
I am afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does
something crazy to his father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should you be taken for an accomplice?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the
signals as a great secret.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more
plainly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm bound to admit the fact,</q> Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic
composure, <q>that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in
this business. As you know yourself (if only you do know it) he
has for several days past locked himself in as soon as night or even
evening comes on. Of late you've been going upstairs to your room
early every evening, and yesterday you did not come down at all,
and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he has begun to lock
himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the
door he won't open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory
Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his
room now. That's the arrangement he made himself ever since this
to-do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his
orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don't get to sleep till midnight,
but am on the watch, getting up and walking about the yard,
waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come. For the last few
days he's been perfectly frantic expecting her. What he argues is,
she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he calls him),
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
<q>and so,</q> says he, <q>she'll come the back-way, late at night, to me.
You look out for her,</q> says he, <q>till midnight and later; and if she
does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window
from the garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then
three times more quickly, then,</q> says he, <q>I shall understand at once
that she has come, and will open the door to you quietly.</q> Another
signal he gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At first,
two knocks, and then, after an interval, another much louder.
Then he will understand that something has happened suddenly and
that I must see him, and he will open to me so that I can go and
speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't come
herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might
come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully
afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna
had come and were locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch
were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should be bound
to let him know at once, knocking three times. So that the first
signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, while
the second signal of three knocks means <q>something important to tell
you.</q> His honor has shown me them several times and explained
them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of these signals
but myself and his honor, so he'd open the door without the slightest
hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of calling
out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch
too, now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you
tell him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it
back from him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day,
<q>You are deceiving me, you are hiding something from me! I'll
break both your legs for you.</q> So I told him those secret signals that
he might see my slavish devotion, and might be satisfied that I was
not deceiving him, but was telling him all I could.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you think that he'll make use of those signals and try to get
in, don't let him in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him
coming in then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate
he is?</q>
</p>

<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>

<p>
<q>Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit,
confound you? Are you laughing at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor
with this fear on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a
presentiment. Fright alone will bring it on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch.
Let Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the
signals without orders from my master. And as for Grigory
Vassilyevitch hearing him and not admitting him, he has been ill
ever since yesterday, and Marfa Ignatyevna intends to give him
medicine to-morrow. They've just arranged it. It's a very strange
remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a preparation and
always keeps it. It's a strong thing made from some herb. She
has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch
three times a year when his lumbago's so bad he is almost paralyzed
by it. Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his
whole back for half an hour till it's quite red and swollen, and what's
left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but
not quite all, for on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and
drinks it herself. And as they never take strong drink, I assure you
they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a very long time.
And when Grigory Vassilyevitch wakes up he is perfectly well after
it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a headache from it. So, if
Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention to-morrow, they won't
hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They'll be asleep.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though
it were planned. You'll have a fit and they'll both be unconscious,</q>
cried Ivan. <q>But aren't you trying to arrange it so?</q> broke from
him suddenly, and he frowned threateningly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on
Dmitri Fyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything,
he'll do it; but if not, I shan't be thrusting him upon his
father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you
say yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won't come at all?</q> Ivan
went on, turning white with anger. <q>You say that yourself, and all
the while I've been here, I've felt sure it was all the old man's fancy,
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
and the creature won't come to him. Why should Dmitri break in
on him if she doesn't come? Speak, I want to know what you are
thinking!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know yourself why he'll come. What's the use of what I
think? His honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious
on account of my illness perhaps, and he'll dash in, as he did
yesterday through impatience to search the rooms, to see whether
she hasn't escaped him on the sly. He is perfectly well aware,
too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big envelope with three thousand
roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed with three seals. On
it is written in his own hand, <q>To my angel Grushenka, if she will
come,</q> to which he added three days later, <q>for my little chicken.</q>
There's no knowing what that might do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q> cried Ivan, almost beside himself. <q>Dmitri won't
come to steal money and kill my father to do it. He might have
killed him yesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic,
savage fool he is, but he won't steal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is in very great need of money now&mdash;the greatest need, Ivan
Fyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he is,</q> Smerdyakov
explained, with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. <q>He
looks on that three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself.
<q>My father still owes me just three thousand,</q> he said. And
besides that, consider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something else
perfectly true. It's as good as certain, so to say, that Agrafena
Alexandrovna will force him, if only she cares to, to marry her&mdash;the
master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch&mdash;if only she cares to,
and of course she may care to. All I've said is that she won't come,
but maybe she's looking for more than that&mdash;I mean to be mistress
here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing
with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all
a stupid thing to do. And she's got plenty of sense. She wouldn't
marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into
consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri
Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
would have anything after the master's death, not a rouble, for
Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply to get hold of the
whole, all the money there is. But if your father were to die now,
there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for Dmitri Fyodorovitch
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
whom he hates so, for he's made no will.... Dmitri Fyodorovitch
knows all that very well.</q>
</p>

<p>
A sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He suddenly flushed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then why on earth,</q> he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, <q>do
you advise me to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by
that? If I go away, you see what will happen here.</q> Ivan drew
his breath with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely so,</q> said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching
Ivan intently, however.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>precisely so</q>?</q> Ivan questioned him,
with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place
I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a
position,</q> answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking
at Ivan's flashing eyes. They were both silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more ... an awful
scoundrel, too.</q> Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about
to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to
Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden
paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute,
would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway,
noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the
moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned
in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know&mdash;early
to-morrow morning. That's all!</q> he suddenly said aloud
angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to
say this then to Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's the best thing you can do,</q> he responded, as though he
had expected to hear it; <q>except that you can always be telegraphed
for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov.
But a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and
carelessness had completely disappeared. His face expressed attention
and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Haven't you something more to say&mdash;something to add?</q> could
be read in the intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.
</p>

<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>

<p>
<q>And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too&mdash;in case
anything happened?</q> Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown
reason raising his voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,</q> Smerdyakov
muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but
gazing intently into Ivan's eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to
save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out
of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely so ...</q> muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice.
He looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to
draw back. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and
went through the gate still laughing. Any one who had seen his
face at that moment would have known that he was not laughing
from lightness of heart, and he could not have explained himself
what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked as
though in a nervous frenzy.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. <q>It's Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man</q></head>

<p>
And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor
Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he went in, he
shouted to him, waving his hands, <q>I am going upstairs to my room,
not in to you. Good-by!</q> and passed by, trying not even to look
at his father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at
that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a
surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently
wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in
the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he
stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going
upstairs, till he passed out of sight.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with him?</q> he promptly asked Smerdyakov,
who had followed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Angry about something. Who can tell?</q> the valet muttered
evasively.
</p>

<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>

<p>
<q>Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar,
and get along with you. Look sharp! No news?</q>
</p>

<p>
Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just
complained of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these
questions we will omit. Half an hour later the house was locked,
and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms in
excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks agreed
upon. Now and then he peered out into the darkness, seeing nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat
up late that night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an account
of his thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that
soul&mdash;its turn will come. And even if one tried, it would be very
hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts in his
brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense excitement.
He felt himself that he had lost his bearings. He was fretted, too,
by all sorts of strange and almost surprising desires; for instance,
after midnight he suddenly had an intense irresistible inclination to
go down, open the door, go to the lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But
if he had been asked why, he could not have given any exact reason,
except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one who had insulted him
more gravely than any one in the world. On the other hand, he was
more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating
terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical
powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred
was rankling in his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on
some one. He even hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had
just had with him. At moments he hated himself intensely. Of
Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot to think, and wondered greatly
at this afterwards, especially as he remembered perfectly that when
he had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he would
go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his
heart, <q>That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy
to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with
peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and
had stealthily, as though he were afraid of being watched, opened the
door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>
stirring down below, had listened a long while&mdash;some five minutes&mdash;with
a sort of strange curiosity, holding his breath while his heart
throbbed. And why he had done all this, why he was listening, he
could not have said. That <q>action</q> all his life afterwards he called
<q>infamous,</q> and at the bottom of his heart, he thought of it as the
basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he felt no
hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious to know
how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing
now. He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of
the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room, listening,
listening&mdash;for some one to knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs
twice to listen like this.
</p>

<p>
About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor
Pavlovitch had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved
to fall asleep at once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did
fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked
early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight. Opening his
eyes, he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous. He
jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then dragged out his trunk
and began packing immediately. His linen had come back from
the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at the
thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his
departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before
(to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was
leaving next day, yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure
when he went to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his
first act in the morning would be to pack his trunk. At last his
trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine o'clock when Marfa
Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, <q>Where will your
honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?</q> He looked
almost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and
gestures, something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father
affably, and even inquiring specially after his health, though he did
not wait to hear his answer to the end, he announced that he was
starting off in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged
him to send for the horses. His father heard this announcement
with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an unmannerly way to show
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>
regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew into a great
flutter at the recollection of some important business of his own.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never
mind; we'll manage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear
boy. Go to Tchermashnya on the way. It's only to turn to the
left from the station at Volovya, only another twelve versts and
you come to Tchermashnya.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the train
starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night. I can only just catch
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off
to Tchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humor your
father! If I hadn't had something to keep me here, I would have
run over myself long ago, for I've some business there in a hurry.
But here I ... it's not the time for me to go now.... You see,
I've two pieces of copse land there. The Maslovs, an old merchant
and his son, will give eight thousand for the timber. But last year
I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve. There's no
getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have it all their
own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here dare
bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday
that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up.
What makes him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is
not afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand
for the copse. Do you hear? But he'll only be here, the priest
writes, for a week altogether, so you must go at once and make a
bargain with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you write to the priest; he'll make the bargain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He can't do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect
treasure, I'd give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without
a receipt; but he has no eye for business, he is a perfect child,
a crow could deceive him. And yet he is a learned man, would you
believe it? This Gorstkin looks like a peasant, he wears a blue
kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That's the common complaint.
He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he
is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife was dead
and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>
was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is
alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you
have to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when
he says he wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the
signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin. I've done business
with him a long time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has
a nasty, thin, red beard. If his beard shakes when he talks and he
gets cross, it's all right, he is saying what he means, he wants to
do business. But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins&mdash;he
is trying to cheat you. Don't watch his eyes, you won't find
out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a rogue&mdash;but watch his
beard! I'll give you a note and you show it to him. He's called
Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy<note place='foot'>i.e.
setter dog.</note>; but don't call him so,
he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and
see it's all right, write here at once. You need only write: <q>He's not
lying.</q> Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock
off, but not more. Just think! there's a difference between eight
thousand and eleven thousand. It's as good as picking up three
thousand; it's not so easy to find a purchaser, and I'm in desperate
need of money. Only let me know it's serious, and I'll run over and
fix it up. I'll snatch the time somehow. But what's the good of my
galloping over, if it's all a notion of the priest's? Come, will you
go?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I can't spare the time. You must excuse me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, you might oblige your father. I shan't forget it. You've
no heart, any of you&mdash;that's what it is? What's a day or two to
you? Where are you going now&mdash;to Venice? Your Venice will
keep another two days. I would have sent Alyosha, but what use
is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you just because you are a
clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You know nothing
about timber, but you've got an eye. All that is wanted is to
see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard&mdash;if
his beard shakes you know he is in earnest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself,
then?</q> cried Ivan, with a malignant smile.
</p>

<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy,
but he caught the smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you'll go, you'll go? I'll scribble the note for you at
once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether I shall go. I don't know. I'll decide on
the way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you
settle the matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he'll send
it on to me at once. And I won't delay you more than that. You
can go to Venice. The priest will give you horses back to Volovya
station.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent
for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When
Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but
to-day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he
did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and
seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this
particularly. <q>He must be bored with me,</q> he thought. Only
when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began
to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to
hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it
at once, and instantly pulled himself up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!</q> he repeated from the
steps. <q>You'll come again some time or other? Mind you do come.
I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan got into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Ivan! Don't be too hard on me!</q> the father called
for the last time.
</p>

<p>
The whole household came out to take leave&mdash;Smerdyakov, Marfa
and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated
himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,</q> broke suddenly
from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of
themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He
