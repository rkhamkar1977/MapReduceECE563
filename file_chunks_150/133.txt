<p>
<q>You will come back again!</q> murmured Father Païssy, looking
after him with sorrowful surprise.

<head>Chapter II. A Critical Moment</head>

<p>
Father Païssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided
that his <q>dear boy</q> would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to
some extent, he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of
Alyosha's spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it
would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange,
vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To
Father Païssy's sorrowful question, <q>Are you too with those of little
faith?</q> I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, <q>No, he
is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.</q> Indeed, all
his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still
the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards
Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest
and most fatal days of his life. If the question is asked: <q>Could all
his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his
elder's body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of
at once performing miracles?</q> I must answer without beating about
the bush, <q>Yes, it certainly was.</q> I would only beg the reader not
to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero's pure heart.
I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent
faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had
made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare, on the
contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his heart.
No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love
was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so
of little value, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what
happened to my hero. But in some cases it is really more creditable
to be carried away by an emotion, however unreasonable, which
springs from a great love, than to be unmoved. And this is even
truer in youth, for a young man who is always sensible is to be
suspected and is of little worth&mdash;that's my opinion!
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, <q>every young man
cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for
others.</q>
</p>

<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>

<p>
To this I reply again, <q>Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and
steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should
not explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary
for the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say
then, it was not a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and
impatient expectation of miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed
no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea&mdash;oh,
no, not at all&mdash;what he saw before all was one figure&mdash;the figure
of his beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he revered
with such adoration. The fact is that all the love that lay concealed
in his pure young heart for every one and everything had, for the
past year, been concentrated&mdash;and perhaps wrongly so&mdash;on one
being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long been
accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy
could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the
moment <q>of every one and everything.</q> He remembered afterwards
how, on that terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his
brother Dmitri, about whom he had been so anxious and troubled the
day before; he had forgotten, too, to take the two hundred roubles
to Ilusha's father, though he had so warmly intended to do so the
preceding evening. But again it was not miracles he needed but only
<q>the higher justice</q> which had been in his belief outraged by the
blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his heart. And
what does it signify that this <q>justice</q> looked for by Alyosha inevitably
took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the
ashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery
cherished the same thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects
Alyosha revered, Father Païssy himself, for instance. And
so Alyosha, untroubled by doubts, clothed his dreams too in the
same form as all the rest. And a whole year of life in the monastery
had formed the habit of this expectation in his heart. But it was
justice, justice, he thirsted for, not simply miracles.
</p>

<p>
And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted
above every one in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving
the glory that was his due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored!
What for? Who had judged him? Who could have decreed this?
Those were the questions that wrung his inexperienced and virginal
<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>
heart. He could not endure without mortification, without resentment
even, that the holiest of holy men should have been exposed
to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior
to him. Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing
marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why this humiliation,
why this premature decay, <q>in excess of nature,</q> as the spiteful
monks said? Why this <q>sign from heaven,</q> which they so triumphantly
acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did
they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the
finger of Providence? Why did Providence hide its face <q>at the most
critical moment</q> (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily
submitting to the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?
</p>

<p>
That was why Alyosha's heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I
have said already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above
everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated! This
murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero,
but I repeat again for the third time&mdash;and am prepared to admit
that it might be difficult to defend my feeling&mdash;I am glad that my
hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment, for any man
of sense will always come back to reason in time, but, if love does
not gain the upper hand in a boy's heart at such an exceptional moment,
when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention something
strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha's
mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was
the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which
now persistently haunted Alyosha's mind. At this moment it
haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental,
elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken. He loved
his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was suddenly
murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil
impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly
revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to
the surface of his consciousness.
</p>

<p>
It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse
from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha,
lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and
apparently asleep. He went up and called him by his name.
</p>

<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>

<p>
<q>You here, Alexey? Can you have&mdash;</q> he began wondering but
broke off. He had meant to say, <q>Can you have come to this?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin
at once saw that he heard and understood him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter?</q> he went on; but the surprise in his face
gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You
suddenly disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this?
You might just look at me...</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the
tree. He was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and
irritability in his face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but
looked away to one side of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know your face is quite changed? There's none of your
famous mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one?
Have they been ill-treating you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me alone,</q> said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of
his hand, still looking away from him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oho! So that's how we are feeling! So you can shout at people
like other mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say,
Alyosha, you have surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It's long
since I've been surprised at anything here. I always took you for an
educated man....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely
understanding what he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has
begun to stink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that
he was going to work miracles?</q> exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what
more do you want?</q> cried Alyosha irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of
thirteen believes in that now. But there.... So now you are in a
temper with your God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn't
given promotion, He hasn't bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you
are a set!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin,
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>
and there was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger
with Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not rebelling against my God; I simply <q>don't accept His
world.</q></q> Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean, you don't accept the world?</q> Rakitin
thought a moment over his answer. <q>What idiocy is this?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha did not answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything
to eat to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't remember.... I think I have.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry
to look at you. You didn't sleep all night either, I hear, you had
a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most
likely you've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I've
got some sausage in my pocket; I've brought it from the town in
case of need, only you won't eat sausage....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me some.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with barricades!
Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to
my place.... I shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired
to death. Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose ... or would
you like some?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me some vodka too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hullo! You surprise me, brother!</q> Rakitin looked at him in
amazement. <q>Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a
jolly fine chance and mustn't be missed. Come along.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>If your little brother Ivan could see this&mdash;wouldn't he be surprised!
By the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this
morning, did you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of
his brother Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute,
and though it reminded him of something that must not be put off
for a moment, some duty, some terrible obligation, even that reminder
made no impression on him, did not reach his heart and
instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten. But, a long
while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a <q>liberal booby
<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>
with no talents whatsoever.</q> Once you, too, could not resist letting
me know I was <q>dishonorable.</q> Well! I should like to see what
your talents and sense of honor will do for you now.</q> This phrase
Rakitin finished to himself in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen!</q> he said aloud, <q>let's go by the path beyond the monastery
straight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov's
by the way. Only fancy, I've written to tell her everything
that happened, and would you believe it, she answered me instantly
in pencil (the lady has a passion for writing notes) that <q>she
would never have expected <emph>such conduct</emph> from a man of such a
reverend character as Father Zossima.</q> That was her very word:
<q>conduct.</q> She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!</q> he cried
suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the
shoulder made him stop too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, Alyosha,</q> he peeped inquisitively into his eyes,
absorbed in a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and
though he was laughing outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter
that new idea aloud, so difficult he still found it to believe in the
strange and unexpected mood in which he now saw Alyosha.
<q>Alyosha, do you know where we had better go?</q> he brought out
at last timidly, and insinuatingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't care ... where you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?</q> pronounced Rakitin
at last, trembling with timid suspense.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's go to Grushenka,</q> Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and
this prompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin
that he almost started back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well! I say!</q> he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly
by the arm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would
change his mind.
</p>

<p>
They walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to
talk.
</p>

<p>
<q>And how glad she will be, how delighted!</q> he muttered, but
lapsed into silence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka
he was taking Alyosha to her. He was a practical person and never
undertook anything without a prospect of gain for himself. His
object in this case was twofold, first a revengeful desire to see <q>the
downfall of the righteous,</q> and Alyosha's fall <q>from the saints
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>
to the sinners,</q> over which he was already gloating in his imagination,
and in the second place he had in view a certain material gain
for himself, of which more will be said later.
</p>

<p>
<q>So the critical moment has come,</q> he thought to himself with
spiteful glee, <q>and we shall catch it on the hop, for it's just what
we want.</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter III. An Onion</head>

<p>
Grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the
cathedral square, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard
belonging to the house of the widow Morozov. The house was a
large stone building of two stories, old and very ugly. The widow
led a secluded life with her two unmarried nieces, who were also
elderly women. She had no need to let her lodge, but every one
knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years
before, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who
was known to be the girl's protector. It was said that the jealous
old man's object in placing his <q>favorite</q> with the widow Morozov
was that the old woman should keep a sharp eye on her new lodger's
conduct. But this sharp eye soon proved to be unnecessary, and in
the end the widow Morozov seldom met Grushenka and did not
worry her by looking after her in any way. It is true that four
years had passed since the old man had brought the slim, delicate,
shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town
of the province, and much had happened since then. Little was
known of the girl's history in the town and that little was vague.
Nothing more had been learnt during the last four years, even after
many persons had become interested in the beautiful young woman
into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna had meanwhile developed.
There were rumors that she had been at seventeen betrayed by
some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards abandoned
by him. The officer had gone away and afterwards married,
while Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. It was
said, however, that though Grushenka had been raised from destitution
by the old man, Samsonov, she came of a respectable family
<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>
belonging to the clerical class, that she was the daughter of a deacon
or something of the sort.
</p>

<p>
And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic
little orphan had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type,
a woman of bold and determined character, proud and insolent. She
had a good head for business, was acquisitive, saving and careful,
and by fair means or foul had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a
little fortune. There was only one point on which all were agreed.
Grushenka was not easily to be approached and except her aged
protector there had not been one man who could boast of her favors
during those four years. It was a positive fact, for there had been
a good many, especially during the last two years, who had attempted
to obtain those favors. But all their efforts had been in
vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified
and even comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance
they met from the strong-willed young person. It was known, too,
that the young person had, especially of late, been given to what
is called <q>speculation,</q> and that she had shown marked abilities in
that direction, so that many people began to say that she was no
better than a Jew. It was not that she lent money on interest, but
it was known, for instance, that she had for some time past, in
partnership with old Karamazov, actually invested in the purchase
of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their nominal value, and afterwards
had made out of them ten times their value.
</p>

<p>
The old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy
and merciless. He tyrannized over his grown-up sons, but, for the
last year during which he had been ill and lost the use of his
swollen legs, he had fallen greatly under the influence of his protégée,
whom he had at first kept strictly and in humble surroundings,
<q>on Lenten fare,</q> as the wits said at the time. But Grushenka
had succeeded in emancipating herself, while she established in him
a boundless belief in her fidelity. The old man, now long since
dead, had had a large business in his day and was also a noteworthy
character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenka's
hold upon him was so strong that he could not live without her (it
had been so especially for the last two years), he did not settle
any considerable fortune on her and would not have been moved
to do so, if she had threatened to leave him. But he had presented
<pb n='383'/><anchor id='Pg383'/>
her with a small sum, and even that was a surprise to every one
when it became known.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a wench with brains,</q> he said to her, when he gave her
eight thousand roubles, <q>and you must look after yourself, but let
me tell you that except your yearly allowance as before, you'll get
nothing more from me to the day of my death, and I'll leave you
nothing in my will either.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons,
whom, with their wives and children, he had treated all his life as
servants. Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this
became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice
to increase her capital and put business in her way.
</p>

<p>
When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka
over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by
falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was,
was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their
whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously
open with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person
in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had
come on the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On
the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of
advice.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you'd
better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel
will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But
don't keep on with the captain, you'll get no good out of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already
that his death was not far off and who actually died five months
later.
</p>

<p>
I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew
of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father
and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood
what really underlay her attitude to both of them. Even
Grushenka's two servants (after the catastrophe of which we will
speak later) testified in court that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch
simply from fear because <q>he threatened to murder her.</q> These
servants were an old cook, invalidish and almost deaf, who came
from Grushenka's old home, and her granddaughter, a smart young
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>
girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka
lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but
luxurious. Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany
furniture in the fashion of 1820, belonging to her landlady.
</p>

<p>
It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms,
yet they were not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her
drawing-room on the big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back.
The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather. Under her
head she had two white down pillows taken from her bed. She was
lying stretched out motionless on her back with her hands behind
her head. She was dressed as though expecting some one, in a black
silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which was very
becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with
a massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting some one. She
lay as though impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips
and eyes hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of
her right foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a
slight excitement. From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap
up from the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice, <q>Who's there?</q>
But the maid met the visitors and at once called back to her mistress.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not he, it's nothing, only other visitors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What can be the matter?</q> muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha
into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A
thick coil of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and
fell on her right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put
it back till she had gazed at her visitors and recognized them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, it's you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have
you brought? Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have
brought him!</q> she exclaimed, recognizing Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do send for candles!</q> said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air
of a most intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the
house.
</p>

<p>
<q>Candles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle....
Well, you have chosen a moment to bring him!</q> she exclaimed
again, nodding towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass
she began quickly fastening up her hair with both hands.
She seemed displeased.
</p>

<pb n='385'/><anchor id='Pg385'/>

<p>
<q>Haven't I managed to please you?</q> asked Rakitin, instantly
almost offended.
</p>

<p>
<q>You frightened me, Rakitin, that's what it is.</q> Grushenka turned
with a smile to Alyosha. <q>Don't be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha,
you cannot think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor.
But you frightened me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in.
You see, I deceived him just now, I made him promise to believe me
and I told him a lie. I told him that I was going to spend the evening
with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and should be there till
late counting up his money. I always spend one whole evening a
week with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in and
he counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down
in the book. I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that
I am there, but I came back and have been sitting locked in here,
expecting some news. How was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya,
run out to the gate, open it and look about whether the captain is
to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding and spying, I am dreadfully
frightened.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I've just looked
out, I keep running to peep through the crack, I am in fear and
trembling myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains&mdash;that's
better!</q> She drew the heavy curtains herself. <q>He'd
rush in at once if he saw a light. I am afraid of your brother
Mitya to-day, Alyosha.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed
very happy about something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?</q> inquired Rakitin. <q>I
should have thought you were not timid with him, you'd twist him
round your little finger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don't want
Mitya at all. And he didn't believe, I feel he didn't, that I should
stay at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. He must be in his ambush now, behind
Fyodor Pavlovitch's, in the garden, watching for me. And if he's
there, he won't come here, so much the better! But I really have
been to Kuzma Kuzmitch's, Mitya escorted me there. I told him I
should stay there till midnight, and I asked him to be sure to come
at midnight to fetch me home. He went away and I sat ten minutes
<pb n='386'/><anchor id='Pg386'/>
with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I was
afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you've
got on!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting
a message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away
and you will see no more of me. That's why I am dressed up, so as
to be ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where are you flying to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you know too much, you'll get old too soon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I've never seen
you like this before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a
ball.</q> Rakitin looked her up and down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Much you know about balls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you know much about them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch's son
was married and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I
want to be talking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing
here. Such a visitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you
and can't believe my eyes. Good heavens, can you have come here
to see me! To tell you the truth, I never had a thought of seeing
you and I didn't think that you would ever come and see me.
Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad to see you.
Sit down on the sofa, here, that's right, my bright young moon. I
really can't take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had
brought him yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is!
Perhaps it's better he has come now, at such a moment, and not the
day before yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
She gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him
with positive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying
when she said so. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a
good-hearted merry laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such
a kind expression in her face.... He had hardly met her till the
day before, he had formed an alarming idea of her, and had been
horribly distressed the day before by the spiteful and treacherous
trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. He was greatly surprised
to find her now altogether different from what he had expected.
And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes involuntarily
<pb n='387'/><anchor id='Pg387'/>
rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemed
changed for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace
of that mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness
in her movements. Everything was simple and good-natured,
her gestures were rapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly
excited.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!</q> she chattered
on again. <q>And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn't
say myself! If you ask me, I couldn't tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, don't you know why you're glad?</q> said Rakitin, grinning.
<q>You used to be always pestering me to bring him, you'd
some object, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had a different object once, but now that's over, this is not the
moment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good-natured
now. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing?
You've sat down already? There's no fear of Rakitin's forgetting
to look after himself. Look, Alyosha, he's sitting there opposite us,
so offended that I didn't ask him to sit down before you. Ugh,
Rakitin is such a one to take offense!</q> laughed Grushenka. <q>Don't
be angry, Rakitin, I'm kind to-day. Why are you so depressed,
Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped into his eyes with
merry mockery</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's sad. The promotion has not been given,</q> boomed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>What promotion?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His elder stinks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something
nasty. Be quiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha,
like this.</q> She suddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing,
on his knee, like a nestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck.
<q>I'll cheer you up, my pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit
on your knee? You won't be angry? If you tell me, I'll get off?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words,
<q>If you tell me, I'll get off,</q> but he did not answer. But there was
nothing in his heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him malignantly
from his corner, might have expected or fancied. The
great grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might
have been aroused, and, if only he could have thought clearly at that
moment, he would have realized that he had now the strongest
<pb n='388'/><anchor id='Pg388'/>
armor to protect him from every lust and temptation. Yet in spite
of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and the sorrow
that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new
and strange sensation in his heart. This woman, this <q>dreadful</q>
woman, had no terror for him now, none of that terror that had
stirred in his soul at any passing thought of woman. On the contrary,
this woman, dreaded above all women, sitting now on his
knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in him now a quite different,
unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the intensest and purest
interest without a trace of fear, of his former terror. That was
what instinctively surprised him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've talked nonsense enough,</q> cried Rakitin, <q>you'd much
better give us some champagne. You owe it me, you know
you do!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne
on the top of everything, if he'd bring you? I'll have some
too! Fenya, Fenya, bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp!
Though I am so stingy, I'll stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin,
you're a toadstool, but he is a falcon! And though my heart is full
of something very different, so be it, I'll drink with you. I long for
some dissipation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what is the matter with you? And what is this message,
may I ask, or is it a secret?</q> Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his
best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually
aimed at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ech, it's not a secret, and you know it, too,</q> Grushenka said,
in a voice suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and
drawing a little away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee
with her arm round his neck. <q>My officer is coming, Rakitin, my
officer is coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard he was coming, but is he so near?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is at Mokroe now; he'll send a messenger from there, so he
wrote; I got a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger
every minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't say so! Why at Mokroe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a long story, I've told you enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya'll be up to something now&mdash;I say! Does he know or
doesn't he?</q>
</p>

<pb n='389'/><anchor id='Pg389'/>

<p>
<q>He know! Of course he doesn't. If he knew, there would be
murder. But I am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his
knife. Be quiet, Rakitin, don't remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
he has bruised my heart. And I don't want to think of that at this
moment. I can think of Alyosha here, I can look at Alyosha ...
smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my foolishness, at my pleasure....
Ah, he's smiling, he's smiling! How kindly he looks at me!
And you know, Alyosha, I've been thinking all this time you were
angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because of that
young lady. I was a cur, that's the truth.... But it's a good thing
it happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.</q> Grushenka
smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile.
<q>Mitya told me that she screamed out that I <q>ought to be flogged.</q>
I did insult her dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a
conquest of me, to win me over with her chocolate.... No, it's
a good thing it did end like that.</q> She smiled again. <q>But I am
still afraid of your being angry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that's really true,</q> Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine
surprise. <q>Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you've no conscience,
that's what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul,
that's how it is! Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my
soul?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration,
Alexey!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what of it, I love him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what about your officer? And the priceless message from
Mokroe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is quite different.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a woman's way of looking at it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't you make me angry, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka caught him
up hotly. <q>This is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different
way. It's true, Alyosha, I had sly designs on you before. For I
am a horrid, violent creature. But at other times I've looked upon
you, Alyosha, as my conscience. I've kept thinking <q>how any one
like that must despise a nasty thing like me.</q> I thought that the day
before yesterday, as I ran home from the young lady's. I have
thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya knows,
<pb n='390'/><anchor id='Pg390'/>
I've talked to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe
it, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed
of myself.... And how, and since when, I began to think about
you like that, I can't say, I don't remember....</q>
</p>

<p>
Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three
glasses of champagne on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here's the champagne!</q> cried Rakitin. <q>You're excited, Agrafena
Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When you've had a glass of
champagne, you'll be ready to dance. Eh, they can't even do that
properly,</q> he added, looking at the bottle. <q>The old woman's
poured it out in the kitchen and the bottle's been brought in warm
and without a cork. Well, let me have some, anyway.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp
and poured himself out another.
</p>

<p>
<q>One doesn't often stumble upon champagne,</q> he said, licking
his lips. <q>Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do!
What shall we drink to? The gates of paradise? Take a glass,
Grushenka, you drink to the gates of paradise, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What gates of paradise?</q>
</p>

<p>
She took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I'd better not,</q> he smiled gently.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you bragged!</q> cried Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if so, I won't either,</q> chimed in Grushenka, <q>I really
don't want any. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin.
If Alyosha has some, I will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What touching sentimentality!</q> said Rakitin tauntingly; <q>and
she's sitting on his knee, too! He's got something to grieve over,
but what's the matter with you? He is rebelling against his God
and ready to eat sausage....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His elder died to-day, Father Zossima, the saint.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So Father Zossima is dead,</q> cried Grushenka. <q>Good God, I
did not know!</q> She crossed herself devoutly. <q>Goodness, what
have I been doing, sitting on his knee like this at such a moment!</q>
She started up as though in dismay, instantly slipped off his knee
and sat down on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed
to dawn in his face.
</p>

<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>

<p>
<q>Rakitin,</q> he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; <q>don't
taunt me with having rebelled against God. I don't want to feel
angry with you, so you must be kinder, too, I've lost a treasure
such as you have never had, and you cannot judge me now. You
had much better look at her&mdash;do you see how she has pity on me?
I came here to find a wicked soul&mdash;I felt drawn to evil because I
was base and evil myself, and I've found a true sister, I have found
a treasure&mdash;a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....
Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You've raised my
soul from the depths.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha's lips were quivering and he caught his breath.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has saved you, it seems,</q> laughed Rakitin spitefully. <q>And
she meant to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka jumped up. <q>Hush, both of you.
Now I'll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make
me ashamed, for I am bad and not good&mdash;that's what I am. And
you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea
of trying to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it's
all different. And don't let me hear anything more from you,
Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are both crazy,</q> said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement.
<q>I feel as though I were in a madhouse. They're both getting
so feeble they'll begin crying in a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall begin to cry, I shall,</q> repeated Grushenka. <q>He called
me his sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you,
Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and
annoyed, though he might have reflected that each of them was just
passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a
lifetime. But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything
that concerned himself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings
and sensations of others&mdash;partly from his youth and inexperience,
partly from his intense egoism.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, Alyosha,</q> Grushenka turned to him with a nervous
laugh. <q>I was boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an
onion, but it's not to boast I tell you about it. It's only a story, but
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
it's a nice story. I used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona,
my cook, who is still with me. It's like this. Once upon a time
there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she was. And
she died and did not leave a single good deed behind. The devils
caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire. So her guardian
angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember
to tell to God; <q>She once pulled up an onion in her garden,</q> said
he, <q>and gave it to a beggar woman.</q> And God answered: <q>You take
that onion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold
and be pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her
come to Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must
stay where she is.</q> The angel ran to the woman and held out the
onion to her. <q>Come,</q> said he, <q>catch hold and I'll pull you out.</q>
And he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her
right out, when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was
being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled
out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began
kicking them. <q>I'm to be pulled out, not you. It's my onion, not
yours.</q> As soon as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman
fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day. So the angel
wept and went away. So that's the story, Alyosha; I know it by
heart, for I am that wicked woman myself. I boasted to Rakitin
that I had given away an onion, but to you I'll say: <q>I've done
nothing but give away one onion all my life, that's the only good
deed I've done.</q> So don't praise me, Alyosha, don't think me good,
I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you
praise me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was
so anxious to get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five
roubles if he would bring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!</q>
</p>

<p>
She went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled
out a purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.
</p>

<p>
<q>What nonsense! What nonsense!</q> cried Rakitin, disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there's no fear of your refusing
it, you asked for it yourself.</q> And she threw the note to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Likely I should refuse it,</q> boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed,
but carrying off his confusion with a swagger. <q>That will come in
very handy; fools are made for wise men's profit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say
<pb n='393'/><anchor id='Pg393'/>
now is not for your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet.
You don't like us, so hold your tongue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I like you for?</q> Rakitin snarled, not concealing
his ill-humor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket
and he felt ashamed at Alyosha's seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving
his payment later, without Alyosha's knowing of it, and
now, feeling ashamed, he lost his temper. Till that moment he had
thought it discreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite
of her snubbing, since he had something to get out of her. But
now he, too, was angry:
</p>

<p>
<q>One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you
done for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make
such a fuss about it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke
with heat and there were hysterical notes in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don't dare to
speak to me like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in
that corner and be quiet, as though you were my footman! And
now, Alyosha, I'll tell you the whole truth, that you may see what
a wretch I am! I am not talking to Rakitin, but to you. I wanted
to ruin you, Alyosha, that's the holy truth; I quite meant to. I
wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you. And why
did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,
you turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes.
And I've looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking
every one about you. Your face haunted my heart. <q>He despises
me,</q> I thought; <q>he won't even look at me.</q> And I felt it so
much at last that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a
boy. I'll get him in my clutches and laugh at him. I was full of
spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody here dares talk or
think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose.
Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was
bound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has
been no one else. But looking at you, I thought, I'll get him in
my clutches and laugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am,
and you called me your sister! And now that man who wronged
<pb n='394'/><anchor id='Pg394'/>
me has come; I sit here waiting for a message from him. And do
you know what that man has been to me? Five years ago, when
Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one
might have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used
to sit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: <q>Where
is he now, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with
another woman, most likely. If only I could see him, if I could
meet him again, I'd pay him out, I'd pay him out!</q> At night I
used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the dark, and I used to brood
over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose and gloat over my anger.
<q>I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!</q> That's what I used to cry out
in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should really do
nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhaps
had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into
helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I
would get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole
world to pieces. And then what do you think? I began saving
money, I became hard-hearted, grew stout&mdash;grew wiser, would you
say? No, no one in the whole world sees it, no one knows it, but
when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did five years ago, when
I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all night, thinking,
<q>I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!</q> Do you hear? Well then, now
you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me&mdash;he was
coming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath
away; then I suddenly thought: <q>If he comes and whistles to call me,
I shall creep back to him like a beaten dog.</q> I couldn't believe myself.
Am I so abject? Shall I run to him or not? And I've been
in such a rage with myself all this month that I am worse than I
was five years ago. Do you see now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive
creature I am? I have shown you the whole truth! I played
with Mitya to keep me from running to that other. Hush, Rakitin,
it's not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to you. Before you
came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole
future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,
Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened
the day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world
knows what I am going through now, and no one ever can know....
<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>
For perhaps I shall take a knife with me to-day, I can't make
up my mind ...</q>
</p>

<p>
And at this <q>tragic</q> phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face
in her hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a
little child.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Misha,</q> he said, <q>don't be angry. She wounded you, but don't
be angry. You heard what she said just now? You mustn't ask
too much of human endurance, one must be merciful.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He
felt obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not
been there, he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked
at him ironically and Alyosha stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>You were so primed up with your elder's teaching last night
that now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!</q> said
Rakitin, with a smile of hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't laugh, Rakitin, don't smile, don't talk of the dead&mdash;he
was better than any one in the world!</q> cried Alyosha, with tears in
his voice. <q>I didn't speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the
judged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and
said to myself, <q>What does it matter?</q> in my cowardliness, but she,
after five years in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the
heart to her&mdash;it makes her forget everything, forgive everything, in
her tears! The man who has wronged her has come back, he sends
for her and she forgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to
meet him and she won't take a knife with her. She won't! No, I
am not like that. I don't know whether you are, Misha, but I am
not like that. It's a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....
Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us?
No, you haven't; if you had, you'd have understood her long ago ...
and the person insulted the day before yesterday must forgive
her, too! She will, when she knows ... and she shall know....
This soul is not yet at peace with itself, one must be tender with it ...
there may be a treasure in that soul....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his
ill-humor Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never
expected such a tirade from the gentle Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love
<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>
with her? Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk's really in love with
you, you've made a conquest!</q> he cried, with a coarse laugh.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha
with a tender smile shining on her tear-stained face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not
a person for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,</q> she turned to
Rakitin, <q>I meant to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but
now I don't want to. Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.</q> She
beckoned to him with a happy smile. <q>That's right, sit here. Tell
me,</q> she shook him by the hand and peeped into his face, smiling,
<q>tell me, do I love that man or not? the man who wronged me, do
I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here in the dark, asking
my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the time
has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have forgiven him already,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I really have forgiven him,</q> Grushenka murmured thoughtfully.
<q>What an abject heart! To my abject heart!</q> She snatched
up a glass from the table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air
and flung it on the floor. The glass broke with a crash. A little
cruel line came into her smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps I haven't forgiven him, though,</q> she said, with a sort of
menace in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as
though she were talking to herself. <q>Perhaps my heart is only getting
ready to forgive. I shall struggle with my heart. You see,
Alyosha, I've grown to love my tears in these five years....
Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I shouldn't care to be in his shoes,</q> hissed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you won't be, Rakitin, you'll never be in his shoes. You
shall black my shoes, Rakitin, that's the place you are fit for. You'll
never get a woman like me ... and he won't either, perhaps ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Won't he? Then why are you dressed up like that?</q> said Rakitin,
with a venomous sneer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don't know all
that is in my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I'll tear it off
at once, this minute,</q> she cried in a resonant voice. <q>You don't
know what that finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and
say: <q>Have you ever seen me look like this before?</q> He left me a
thin, consumptive cry-baby of seventeen. I'll sit by him, fascinate
<pb n='397'/><anchor id='Pg397'/>
him and work him up. <q>Do you see what I am like now?</q> I'll say
to him; <q>well, and that's enough for you, my dear sir, there's many
a slip twixt the cup and the lip!</q> That may be what the finery is
for, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh. <q>I'm
violent and resentful, Alyosha, I'll tear off my finery, I'll destroy
my beauty, I'll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn
beggar. If I choose, I won't go anywhere now to see any one. If I
choose, I'll send Kuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow,
and all his money and I'll go out charing for the rest of my life.
You think I wouldn't do it, Rakitin, that I would not dare to do it?
I would, I would, I could do it directly, only don't exasperate me ...
and I'll send him about his business, I'll snap my fingers
in his face, he shall never see me again!</q>
</p>

<p>
She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke
down again, hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and
shook with sobs.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's time we were off,</q> he said, <q>it's late, we shall be shut out of
the monastery.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka leapt up from her place.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha!</q> she cried, in mournful
surprise. <q>What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling,
tortured me, and now you'll leave me to face this night alone!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants
to, let him! I'll go alone,</q> Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, evil tongue!</q> Grushenka cried angrily at him; <q>you never
said such words to me as he has come to say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What has he said to you so special?</q> asked Rakitin irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he said to me,
it went straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the
first, the only one who has pitied me, that's what it is. Why did
you not come before, you angel?</q> She fell on her knees before him
as though in a sudden frenzy. <q>I've been waiting all my life for
some one like you, I knew that some one like you would come and
forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, some one would really
love me, not only with a shameful love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I done to you?</q> answered Alyosha, bending over
her with a tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; <q>I
<pb n='398'/><anchor id='Pg398'/>
only gave you an onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was
all!</q>
</p>

<p>
He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment
there was a sudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall.
Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily
into the room, crying out:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,</q> she cried,
breathless and joyful. <q>A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey
the driver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses....
A letter, here's the letter, mistress.</q>
</p>

<p>
A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while
she talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it
to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one
instant.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has sent for me,</q> she cried, her face white and distorted,
with a wan smile; <q>he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!</q>
</p>

<p>
But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly
the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go,</q> she cried; <q>five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by,
Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don't
let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don't
you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to
my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!</q>
</p>

<p>
She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, she has no thoughts for us now!</q> grumbled Rakitin.
<q>Let's go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick
of all these tears and cries.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood
a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were
running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being
led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the
bottom of the steps, Grushenka's bedroom window was suddenly
opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha:
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him
not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery.
And tell him, too, in my words: <q>Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel,
and not to you, noble heart.</q> And add, too, that Grushenka
loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him&mdash;so let
<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>
him remember that hour all his life&mdash;say, <q>Grushenka tells you to!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a
slam.
</p>

<p>
<q>H'm, h'm!</q> growled Rakitin, laughing, <q>she murders your
brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life! What
ferocity!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked
fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in
thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as
though he had been touched on an open wound. He had expected
something quite different by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha together.
Something very different from what he had hoped for had
happened.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a Pole, that officer of hers,</q> he began again, restraining
himself; <q>and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in
the customs in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some
puny little beggar of a Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He's
heard now that Grushenka's saved a little money, so he's turned up
again&mdash;that's the explanation of the mystery.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, so you've saved the sinner?</q> he laughed spitefully. <q>Have
you turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the
seven devils, eh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for
just now have come to pass!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Rakitin,</q> Alyosha answered with an aching heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've sold
my friend, you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am
not Judas.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it,</q> cried Alyosha,
<q>you remind me of it yourself....</q>
</p>

<p>
But this was the last straw for Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation take you all and each of you!</q> he cried suddenly,
<q>why the devil did I take you up? I don't want to know you from
this time forward. Go alone, there's your road!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha
alone in the dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked
across the fields to the monastery.
</p>

<head>Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee</head>

<p>
It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha
returned to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a
special entrance. It had struck nine o'clock&mdash;the hour of rest and
repose after a day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly
opened the door and went into the elder's cell where his coffin was
now standing. There was no one in the cell but Father Païssy,
reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice
Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's conversation and
the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep sound
sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father
Païssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.
Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his
knees and began to pray.
</p>

<p>
His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single
sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another
in a slow, continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart
and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw
that coffin before him, the hidden dead figure so precious to him,
but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning was no longer
aching in his soul. As soon as he came in, he fell down before the
coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy was glowing in his mind
and in his heart. The one window of the cell was open, the air
was fresh and cool. <q>So the smell must have become stronger, if
they opened the window,</q> thought Alyosha. But even this thought
of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and
humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him feel miserable
or indignant. He began quietly praying, but he soon felt that he
was praying almost mechanically. Fragments of thought floated
through his soul, flashed like stars and went out again at once, to
be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning in his soul a
sense of the wholeness of things&mdash;something steadfast and comforting&mdash;and
he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying
ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....
</p>

<pb n='401'/><anchor id='Pg401'/>

<p>
But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something
else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what
had interrupted it. He began listening to what Father Païssy was
reading, but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze.
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;</emph></q>
read Father Païssy. <q><emph>And the mother of Jesus was there; And both
Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marriage? What's that?... A marriage!</q> floated whirling
through Alyosha's mind. <q>There is happiness for her, too.... She
has gone to the feast.... No, she has not taken the knife....
That was only a tragic phrase.... Well ... tragic phrases should
be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases comfort the heart....
Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to bear. Rakitin
has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broods over
his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the
high road ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal,
and the sun is at the end of it.... Ah!... What's being
read?</q>...
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine</emph></q> ... Alyosha heard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn't want to miss it, I love
that passage: it's Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that
miracle! Ah, that sweet miracle! It was not men's grief, but
their joy Christ visited, He worked His first miracle to help men's
gladness.... <q>He who loves men loves their gladness, too</q> ...
He was always repeating that, it was one of his leading ideas....
<q>There's no living without joy,</q> Mitya says.... Yes, Mitya....
<q>Everything that is true and good is always full of forgiveness,</q> he
used to say that, too</q> ...
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or
me? Mine hour is not yet come.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
you, do it</emph></q> ...
</p>

<p>
<q>Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor,
people.... Of course they were poor, since they hadn't wine
enough even at a wedding.... The historians write that, in those
days, the people living about the Lake of Gennesaret were the poorest
that can possibly be imagined ... and another great heart,
<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>
that other great being, His Mother, knew that He had come not
only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that His heart
was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure
and unlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor
wedding. <q>Mine hour is not yet come,</q> He said, with a soft smile
(He must have smiled gently to her). And, indeed, was it to make
wine abundant at poor weddings He had come down to earth?
And yet He went and did as she asked Him.... Ah, he is
reading again</q>....
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor
of the feast. And they bare it.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew
the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
good wine; and when men have well drunk, that which is worse;
but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?...
Ah, yes ... It's the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of
course. Here are the guests, here are the young couple sitting,
and the merry crowd and ... Where is the wise governor of the
feast? But who is this? Who? Again the walls are receding....
Who is getting up there from the great table? What!... He
here, too? But he's in the coffin ... but he's here, too. He has
stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!</q>...
</p>

<p>
Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man,
with tiny wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There
was no coffin now, and he was in the same dress as he had worn
yesterday sitting with them, when the visitors had gathered about
him. His face was uncovered, his eyes were shining. How was this,
then? He, too, had been called to the feast. He, too, at the marriage
of Cana in Galilee....
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,</q> he heard a
soft voice saying over him. <q>Why have you hidden yourself here,
out of sight? You come and join us too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>

<p>
It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he,
since he called him!
</p>

<p>
The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are rejoicing,</q> the little, thin old man went on. <q>We are
drinking the new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see
how many guests? Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the
wise governor of the feast, he is tasting the new wine. Why do
you wonder at me? I gave an onion to a beggar, so I, too, am here.
And many here have given only an onion each&mdash;only one little
onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle one, you,
my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman
an onion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!...
Do you see our Sun, do you see Him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid ... I dare not look,</q> whispered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His
sublimity, but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto
us from love and rejoices with us. He is changing the water into
wine that the gladness of the guests may not be cut short. He is
expecting new guests, He is calling new ones unceasingly for ever
and ever.... There they are bringing new wine. Do you see they
are bringing the vessels....</q>
</p>

<p>
Something glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it till it
ached, tears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out
his hands, uttered a cry and waked up.
</p>

<p>
Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct
reading of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading.
It was strange, he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was
on his feet, and suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three
firm rapid steps he went right up to the coffin. His shoulder
brushed against Father Païssy without his noticing it. Father Païssy
raised his eyes for an instant from his book, but looked away again
at once, seeing that something strange was happening to the boy.
Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at the covered, motionless
dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on his breast
and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. He had
only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing in
his ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly
he turned sharply and went out of the cell.
</p>

<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>

<p>
He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his
soul, overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness.
The vault of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched
vast and fathomless above him. The Milky Way ran in two pale
streams from the zenith to the horizon. The fresh, motionless, still
night enfolded the earth. The white towers and golden domes of
the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire sky. The gorgeous
autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were slumbering till
morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the silence of
the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the
stars....
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the
earth. He did not know why he embraced it. He could not have
told why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he
kissed it weeping, sobbing and watering it with his tears, and vowed
passionately to love it, to love it for ever and ever. <q>Water the
earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears,</q> echoed in his
soul.
</p>

<p>
What was he weeping over?
</p>
