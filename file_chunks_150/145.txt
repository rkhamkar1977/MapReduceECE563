<p>
<q>Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!</q> Ivan cried, unable to
restrain himself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing
himself till the end of the conversation. <q>You still mean that
<pb n='709'/><anchor id='Pg709'/>
Tchermashnya? Stay, tell me, why did you want my consent, if you
really took Tchermashnya for consent? How will you explain that
now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn't
have made an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if
I'd been suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice;
on the contrary, you would have protected me from
others.... And when you got your inheritance you would have
rewarded me when you were able, all the rest of your life. For
you'd have received your inheritance through me, seeing that if he
had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn't have had a
farthing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,</q>
snarled Ivan. <q>And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had informed
against you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to
Tchermashnya? That's all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation
you would either have gone away or have stayed. If you had
stayed, nothing would have happened. I should have known that
you didn't want it done, and should have attempted nothing. As
you went away, it meant you assured me that you wouldn't dare to
inform against me at the trial, and that you'd overlook my having
the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn't have prosecuted
me afterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court;
that is, not that I had stolen the money or killed him&mdash;I shouldn't
have said that&mdash;but that you'd put me up to the theft and the
murder, though I didn't consent to it. That's why I needed your
consent, so that you couldn't have cornered me afterwards, for what
proof could you have had? I could always have cornered you, revealing
your eagerness for your father's death, and I tell you the
public would have believed it all, and you would have been ashamed
for the rest of your life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Was I then so eager, was I?</q> Ivan snarled again.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned
my doing it.</q> Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He
was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner
force urged him on. He evidently had some design. Ivan felt that.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go on,</q> he said. <q>Tell me what happened that night.</q>
</p>

<pb n='710'/><anchor id='Pg710'/>

<p>
<q>What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard
the master shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly
got up and came out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then
all was silence and darkness. I lay there waiting, my heart beating;
I couldn't bear it. I got up at last, went out. I saw the window
open on the left into the garden, and I stepped to the left to listen
whether he was sitting there alive, and I heard the master moving
about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. <q>Ech!</q> I thought. I went
to the window and shouted to the master, <q>It's I.</q> And he shouted
to me, <q>He's been, he's been; he's run away.</q> He meant Dmitri
Fyodorovitch had been. <q>He's killed Grigory!</q> <q>Where?</q> I whispered.
<q>There, in the corner,</q> he pointed. He was whispering, too.
<q>Wait a bit,</q> I said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and
there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered
with blood, senseless. So it's true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been
here, was the thought that came into my head, and I determined on
the spot to make an end of it, as Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he
were alive, would see nothing of it, as he lay there senseless. The
only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up. I felt that at
the moment, but the longing to get it done came over me, till I could
scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the master and said,
<q>She's here, she's come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants to
be let in.</q> And he started like a baby. <q>Where is she?</q> he fairly
gasped, but couldn't believe it. <q>She's standing there,</q> said I.
<q>Open.</q> He looked out of the window at me, half believing and
half distrustful, but afraid to open. <q>Why, he is afraid of me now,</q>
I thought. And it was funny. I bethought me to knock on the
window-frame those taps we'd agreed upon as a signal that
Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his eyes. He didn't
seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps, he ran
at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, but
he stood in the way to prevent me passing. <q>Where is she? Where
is she?</q> He looked at me, all of a tremble. <q>Well,</q> thought I, <q>if
he's so frightened of me as all that, it's a bad look out!</q> And my
legs went weak with fright that he wouldn't let me in or would call
out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up, or something else might
happen. I don't remember now, but I must have stood pale, facing
him. I whispered to him, <q>Why, she's there, there, under the window;
<pb n='711'/><anchor id='Pg711'/>
how is it you don't see her?</q> I said. <q>Bring her then, bring
her.</q> <q>She's afraid,</q> said I; <q>she was frightened at the noise, she's
hidden in the bushes; go and call to her yourself from the study.</q>
He ran to the window, put the candle in the window. <q>Grushenka,</q>
he cried, <q>Grushenka, are you here?</q> Though he cried that, he
didn't want to lean out of the window, he didn't want to move away
from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn't
dare to turn his back on me. <q>Why, here she is,</q> said I. I went
up to the window and leaned right out of it. <q>Here she is; she's in
the bush, laughing at you, don't you see her?</q> He suddenly believed
it; he was all of a shake&mdash;he was awfully crazy about her&mdash;and
he leaned right out of the window. I snatched up that iron
paper-weight from his table; do you remember, weighing about three
pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the
corner of it. He didn't even cry out. He only sank down suddenly,
and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time I
knew I'd broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face
upwards, covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood
on me, not a spot. I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up
to the ikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung the
envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it. I went out into
the garden all of a tremble, straight to the apple-tree with a hollow
in it&mdash;you know that hollow. I'd marked it long before and put a
rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I wrapped all the notes in the
rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And there it stayed for
over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out of the
hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, <q>If Grigory
Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me,
but if he is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he'll
bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he
must have killed him and taken the money.</q> Then I began groaning
with suspense and impatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as
soon as possible. At last she got up and she rushed to me, but when
she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there, she ran out, and I
heard her scream in the garden. And that set it all going and set
my mind at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without
stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov
<pb n='712'/><anchor id='Pg712'/>
glanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept
his eyes averted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated
and was breathing hard. The perspiration stood out on his face.
But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he was feeling,
or what.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> cried Ivan, pondering. <q>What about the door? If he
only opened the door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open
before? For Grigory saw it before you went.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different
tone, not angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at
that moment and peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded
that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary, though
interesting, subject.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch's having seen it
open, that's only his fancy,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile.
<q>He is not a man, I assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn't
see it, but fancied he had seen it, and there's no shaking him. It's
just our luck he took that notion into his head, for they can't fail
to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch after that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen ...</q> said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and
making an effort to grasp something. <q>Listen. There are a lot of
questions I want to ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting
and getting mixed up. Yes. Tell me this at least, why
did you open the envelope and leave it there on the floor? Why
didn't you simply carry off the envelope?... When you were
telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the right
thing to do ... but why, I can't understand....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about
it, as I did for instance, if he'd seen those notes before, and perhaps
had put them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope
sealed up and addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done
the murder, what should have made him tear open the envelope
afterwards, especially in such desperate haste, since he'd know for
certain the notes must be in the envelope? No, if the robber had
been some one like me, he'd simply have put the envelope straight
in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he could. But it'd be
quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew about the
envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he'd found it, for
<pb n='713'/><anchor id='Pg713'/>
instance, under the mattress, he'd have torn it open as quickly as
possible to make sure the notes were in it. And he'd have thrown
the envelope down, without having time to think that it would be
evidence against him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had
never directly stolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born,
and if he did bring himself to steal, it would not be regular stealing,
but simply taking what was his own, for he'd told the whole town
he meant to before, and had even bragged aloud before every one
that he'd go and take his property from Fyodor Pavlovitch. I
didn't say that openly to the prosecutor when I was being examined,
but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as though I
didn't see it myself, and as though he'd thought of it himself and
I hadn't prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor's mouth positively
watered at my suggestion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?</q>
cried Ivan, overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov
again with alarm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate
hurry? It was all thought out beforehand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!</q> Ivan cried again.
<q>No, you are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....</q>
</p>

<p>
He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He
was in terrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there
was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only
turned round where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the
impossibility of moving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out
almost as furiously as before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don't you understand
that if I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am keeping
you to answer to-morrow at the trial. God sees,</q> Ivan raised
his hand, <q>perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret
desire for my father's ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty
as you think, and perhaps I didn't urge you on at all. No, no, I
didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence against
myself to-morrow at the trial. I'm determined to! I shall tell
everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance together.
And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence
you give, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you. I'll confirm
<pb n='714'/><anchor id='Pg714'/>
it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must, you must;
we'll go together. That's how it shall be!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes
alone it could be seen that it would be so.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,</q>
Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent
sympathy in fact.
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll go together,</q> Ivan repeated. <q>And if you won't go, no
matter, I'll go alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go,</q> he concluded
at last positively.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't understand me,</q> Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what's
more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I
never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill
(and it looks like it, too), or that you're so sorry for your brother
that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it
all against me, for you've always thought no more of me than if
I'd been a fly. And who will believe you, and what single proof
have you got?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take that money away with you,</q> Smerdyakov sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you
committed the murder for the sake of it?</q> Ivan looked at him
with great surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want it,</q> Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice,
with a gesture of refusal. <q>I did have an idea of beginning a new
life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream
of it, chiefly because <q>all things are lawful.</q> That was quite right
what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about that. For if
there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as virtue, and
there's no need of it. You were right there. So that's how I
looked at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you come to that of yourself?</q> asked Ivan, with a wry
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>With your guidance.</q>
</p>

<pb n='715'/><anchor id='Pg715'/>

<p>
<q>And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving
back the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe,</q> whispered Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then why are you giving it back?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave off ... that's enough!</q> Smerdyakov waved his hand
again. <q>You used to say yourself that everything was lawful, so
now why are you so upset, too? You even want to go and give
evidence against yourself.... Only there'll be nothing of the
sort! You won't go to give evidence,</q> Smerdyakov decided with
conviction.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll see,</q> said Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money,
I know that. You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud;
you are far too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most
of all about living in undisturbed comfort, without having to
depend on any one&mdash;that's what you care most about. You won't
want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself.
You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like him than
any of his children; you've the same soul as he had.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not a fool,</q> said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood
rushed to his face. <q>You are serious now!</q> he observed, looking suddenly
at Smerdyakov with a different expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the
money.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket
without wrapping them in anything.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall show them at the court to-morrow,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nobody will believe you, as you've plenty of money of your own;
you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought
it to the court.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>I repeat,</q> he said, <q>the only reason I haven't killed you is that I
need you for to-morrow, remember that, don't forget it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, kill me. Kill me now,</q> Smerdyakov said, all at once looking
strangely at Ivan. <q>You won't dare do that even!</q> he added,
with a bitter smile. <q>You won't dare to do anything, you, who
used to be so bold!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-morrow,</q> cried Ivan, and moved to go out.
</p>

<pb n='716'/><anchor id='Pg716'/>

<p>
<q>Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov
looked at them for ten seconds.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you can go,</q> he said, with a wave of his hand. <q>Ivan
Fyodorovitch!</q> he called after him again.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q> Ivan turned without stopping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-morrow!</q> Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps
boldly, but suddenly began staggering. <q>It's something physical,</q>
he thought with a grin. Something like joy was springing up in his
heart. He was conscious of unbounded resolution; he would make
an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late. His
determination was taken, <q>and now it will not be changed,</q> he
thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against something
and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his
feet the peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless.
The snow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized
him and lifted him in his arms. Seeing a light in the little house
to the right he went up, knocked at the shutters, and asked the man
to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the
police-station, promising him three roubles. The man got ready
and came out. I won't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his
object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging for
a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the
expenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but
Ivan was well content with it. His mind wandered and worked
incessantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,</q> he
reflected with satisfaction, <q>I should not have stayed a whole hour to
look after the peasant, but should have passed by, without caring
about his being frozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by
the way,</q> he thought at the same instant, with still greater satisfaction,
<q>although they have decided that I am going out of my
mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
Just as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself
suddenly hadn't he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell
<pb n='717'/><anchor id='Pg717'/>
him everything. He decided the question by turning back to the
house. <q>Everything together to-morrow!</q> he whispered to himself,
and, strange to say, almost all his gladness and self-satisfaction
passed in one instant.
</p>

<p>
As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice
on his heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of
something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at
that moment, and had been there before. He sank wearily on his
sofa. The old woman brought him a samovar; he made tea, but
did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt giddy. He felt that
he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop asleep, but got
up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness.
At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness that
he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round,
as though searching for something. This happened several times.
At last his eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled,
but an angry flush suffused his face. He sat a long time in his
place, his head propped on both arms, though he looked sideways at
the same point, at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall.
There was evidently something, some object, that irritated him there,
worried him and tormented him.
</p>

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter IX. The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare</head>

<p>
I am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when
I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of
Ivan's illness. Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he
was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever.
Though his health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn
resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery
over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard
the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible effort of
will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of course,
to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he
loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching
<pb n='718'/><anchor id='Pg718'/>
crisis in his life, when he needed to have all his wits about him,
to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and <q>to justify
himself to himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been
brought from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's
to which I have referred already. After listening to him and examining
him the doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually
suffering from some disorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised
by an admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him.
<q>Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,</q> the doctor
opined, <q>though it would be better to verify them ... you must
take steps at once, without a moment's delay, or things will go
badly with you.</q> But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice
and did not take to his bed to be nursed. <q>I am walking about, so
I am strong enough, if I drop, it'll be different then, any one may
nurse me who likes,</q> he decided, dismissing the subject.
</p>

<p>
And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium
and, as I have said already, looking persistently at some object on
the sofa against the opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting
there, though goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not
been in the room when Ivan came into it, on his return from
Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a
Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young,
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>qui faisait la cinquantaine</foreign>,
as the French say, with rather long, still thick, dark
hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed beard. He
was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made
by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,
that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last
two years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such
as are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection
his linen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very
threadbare. The visitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but
were too light in color and too tight for the present fashion. His
soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season.
</p>

<p>
In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened
means. It looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class
of idle landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom.
He had unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable
<pb n='719'/><anchor id='Pg719'/>
society, had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them
indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished
on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor
relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to
another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating
disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could
be asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place
of honor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent
position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who
have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon
them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers.
Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always being
brought up at a distance, at some aunt's, to whom these gentlemen
never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the relationship.
They gradually lose sight of their children altogether, though at
intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and
sometimes even answer it.
</p>

<p>
The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured,
as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression
as occasion might arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell
lorgnette on a black ribbon. On the middle finger of his
right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it.
</p>

<p>
Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation.
The visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come
down from his room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly
silent, seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied.
But he was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host
should begin it. All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say,</q> he began to Ivan, <q>excuse me, I only mention it to remind
you. You went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina
Ivanovna, but you came away without finding out anything about
her, you probably forgot&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes,</q> broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with
uneasiness. <q>Yes, I'd forgotten ... but it doesn't matter now,
never mind, till to-morrow,</q> he muttered to himself, <q>and you,</q> he
added, addressing his visitor, <q>I should have remembered that myself
in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me! Why
<pb n='720'/><anchor id='Pg720'/>
do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me, and
that I didn't remember it of myself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't believe it then,</q> said the gentleman, smiling amicably,
<q>what's the good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs
are no help to believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed,
not because he saw Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe,
before he saw. Look at the spiritualists, for instance.... I am
very fond of them ... only fancy, they imagine that they are
serving the cause of religion, because the devils show them their
horns from the other world. That, they say, is a material proof, so
to speak, of the existence of another world. The other world and
material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does proving
there's a devil prove that there's a God? I want to join an idealist
society, I'll lead the opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist, but not
a materialist, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen,</q> Ivan suddenly got up from the table. <q>I seem to be
delirious.... I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like,
I don't care! You won't drive me to fury, as you did last time.
But I feel somehow ashamed.... I want to walk about the room....
I sometimes don't see you and don't even hear your voice as
I did last time, but I always guess what you are prating, for it's I,
<emph>I myself speaking, not you</emph>. Only I don't know whether I was
dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I'll wet a towel
and put it on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and
with a wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,</q> the visitor began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>do you suppose I should stand on ceremony
with you? I am in good spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead ...
and in the top of my head ... only please don't talk
philosophy, as you did last time. If you can't take yourself off,
talk of something amusing. Talk gossip, you are a poor relation,
you ought to talk gossip. What a nightmare to have! But I am not
afraid of you. I'll get the better of you. I won't be taken to a
mad-house!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est charmant</foreign>,
poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape.
For what am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am
listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually
<pb n='721'/><anchor id='Pg721'/>
beginning to take me for something real, not simply your fancy, as
you persisted in declaring last time&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,</q> Ivan cried
with a sort of fury. <q>You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a
phantom. It's only that I don't know how to destroy you and I see
I must suffer for a time. You are my hallucination. You are the
incarnation of myself, but only of one side of me ... of my
thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and stupidest of them.
From that point of view you might be of interest to me, if only
I had time to waste on you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, excuse me, I'll catch you. When you flew out at
Alyosha under the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him,
<q>You learnt it from <emph>him</emph>! How do you know that <emph>he</emph> visits
me?</q> you were thinking of me then. So for one brief moment you did
believe that I really exist,</q> the gentleman laughed blandly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn't believe
in you. I don't know whether I was asleep or awake last time.
Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn't see you really at all&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a
dear; I've treated him badly over Father Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!</q> Ivan
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You scold me, but you laugh&mdash;that's a good sign. But you are
ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why:
that great resolution of yours&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't speak of my resolution,</q> cried Ivan, savagely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, I understand, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>c'est noble,
c'est charmant</foreign>, you are
going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ...
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est chevaleresque</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, I'll kick you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained.
If you kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don't
kick ghosts. Joking apart, it doesn't matter to me, scold if you
like, though it's better to be a trifle more polite even to me. <q>Fool,
flunkey!</q> what words!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Scolding you, I scold myself,</q> Ivan laughed again, <q>you are
myself, myself, only with a different face. You just say what I am
thinking ... and are incapable of saying anything new!</q>
</p>

<pb n='722'/><anchor id='Pg722'/>

<p>
<q>If I am like you in my way of thinking, it's all to my credit,</q>
the gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.
</p>

<p>
<q>You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what's more, the
stupid ones. You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid.
No, I can't put up with you! What am I to do, what am I to do?</q>
Ivan said through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman
and to be recognized as such,</q> the visitor began in an excess
of deprecating and simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation.
<q>I am poor, but ... I won't say very honest, but ... it's an
axiom generally accepted in society that I am a fallen angel. I
certainly can't conceive how I can ever have been an angel. If I
ever was, it must have been so long ago that there's no harm in
forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a gentlemanly
person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I
love men genuinely, I've been greatly calumniated! Here when I
stay with you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality
and that's what I like most of all. You see, like you, I suffer
from the fantastic and so I love the realism of earth. Here, with
you, everything is circumscribed, here all is formulated and geometrical,
while we have nothing but indeterminate equations! I
wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming. Besides, on earth
I become superstitious. Please don't laugh, that's just what I like,
to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I've grown
fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go
and steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is
becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of
some merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all
she believes. My ideal is to go to church and offer a candle in
simple-hearted faith, upon my word it is. Then there would be an
end to my sufferings. I like being doctored too; in the spring there
was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was vaccinated in a
foundling hospital&mdash;if only you knew how I enjoyed myself that
day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But
you are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this
evening? I know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well,
what about your health? What did the doctor say?</q>
</p>

<pb n='723'/><anchor id='Pg723'/>

<p>
<q>Fool!</q> Ivan snapped out.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn't
ask out of sympathy. You needn't answer. Now rheumatism has
come in again&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool!</q> repeated Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of
rheumatism last year that I remember it to this day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil have rheumatism!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly
form and I take the consequences. Satan <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sum
et nihil humanum a me alienum puto</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, what, Satan <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sum
et nihil humanum</foreign> ... that's not bad
for the devil!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad I've pleased you at last.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you didn't get that from me.</q> Ivan stopped suddenly,
seeming struck. <q>That never entered my head, that's strange.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est du nouveau,
n'est-ce pas?</foreign> This time I'll act honestly and
explain to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from
indigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions,
such complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world
of events, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from
the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear
Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such dreams are sometimes
seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people, officials, journalists,
priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A statesman
confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him
when he was asleep. Well, that's how it is now, though I am your
hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which
had not entered your head before. So I don't repeat your ideas, yet
I am only your nightmare, nothing more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and
are not my nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I've adopted a special method to-day, I'll explain
it to you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I
caught cold then, only not here but yonder.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Can't you
go away?</q> Ivan exclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to
<pb n='724'/><anchor id='Pg724'/>
and fro, sat down on the sofa, leaned his elbows on the table again
and held his head tight in both hands. He pulled the wet towel off
and flung it away in vexation. It was evidently of no use.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your nerves are out of order,</q> observed the gentleman, with
a carelessly easy, though perfectly polite, air. <q>You are angry with
me even for being able to catch cold, though it happened in a most
natural way. I was hurrying then to a diplomatic
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirée</foreign> at the house
of a lady of high rank in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in
the Ministry. Well, an evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was
God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth....
Of course, it took only an instant, but you know a ray of light
from the sun takes full eight minutes, and fancy in an evening suit
and open waistcoat. Spirits don't freeze, but when one's in fleshly
form, well ... in brief, I didn't think, and set off, and you know
in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is above the firmament,
there's such a frost ... at least one can't call it frost, you can
fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game the village
girls play&mdash;they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees
of frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin
off, so it bleeds. But that's only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I
imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it
would be the end of it ... if only there could be an ax there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And can there be an ax there?</q> Ivan interrupted, carelessly and
disdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe
in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.
</p>

<p>
<q>An ax?</q> the guest interrupted in surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what would become of an ax there?</q> Ivan cried suddenly,
with a sort of savage and insistent obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
<q>What would become of an ax in space?
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Quelle idée!</foreign> If it were
to fall to any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the
earth without knowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would
calculate the rising and the setting of the ax, <hi rend='italic'>Gatzuk</hi> would put
it in his calendar, that's all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are stupid, awfully stupid,</q> said Ivan peevishly. <q>Fib more
cleverly or I won't listen. You want to get the better of me by
realism, to convince me that you exist, but I don't want to believe
you exist! I won't believe it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not fibbing, it's all the truth; the truth is unhappily
<pb n='725'/><anchor id='Pg725'/>
hardly ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big
of me, and perhaps something fine. That's a great pity, for I only
give what I can&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't talk philosophy, you ass!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am
moaning and groaning. I've tried all the medical faculty: they can
diagnose beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their
finger-tips, but they've no idea how to cure you. There was an
enthusiastic little student here, <q>You may die,</q> said he, <q>but you'll
know perfectly what disease you are dying of!</q> And then what a
way they have sending people to specialists! <q>We only diagnose,</q>
they say, <q>but go to such-and-such a specialist, he'll cure you.</q>
The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of disease has completely
disappeared, I assure you, now there are only specialists and they all
advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrong with your nose,
they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European specialist who
cures noses. If you go to Paris, he'll look at your nose; I can only
cure your right nostril, he'll tell you, for I don't cure the left
nostril, that's not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there's a
specialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I
fell back on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub
myself with honey and salt in the bath-house. Solely to get an
extra bath I went, smeared myself all over and it did me no good
at all. In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a
book and some drops, bless him, and, only fancy, Hoff's malt extract
cured me! I bought it by accident, drank a bottle and a half of it,
and I was ready to dance, it took it away completely. I made up
my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I was prompted
by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a
bother: not a single paper would take my letter. <q>It would be very
reactionary,</q> they said, <q>no one will believe it.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Le diable n'existe point.</foreign>
You'd better remain anonymous,</q> they advised me. What
use is a letter of thanks if it's anonymous? I laughed with the men
at the newspaper office; <q>It's reactionary to believe in God in our
days,</q> I said, <q>but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.</q> <q>We quite
understand that,</q> they said. <q>Who doesn't believe in the devil?
Yet it won't do, it might injure our reputation. As a joke, if you
like.</q> But I thought as a joke it wouldn't be very witty. So it
<pb n='726'/><anchor id='Pg726'/>
wasn't printed. And do you know, I have felt sore about it to this
day. My best feelings, gratitude, for instance, are literally denied
me simply from my social position.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Philosophical reflections again?</q> Ivan snarled malignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>God preserve me from it, but one can't help complaining sometimes.
I am a slandered man. You upbraid me every moment with
being stupid. One can see you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence
isn't the only thing! I have naturally a kind and merry heart.
<q>I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.</q> You seem to take me for
Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more serious one. Before
time was, by some decree which I could never make out, I was pre-destined
<q>to deny</q> and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not at
all inclined to negation. <q>No, you must go and deny, without denial
there's no criticism and what would a journal be without a column
of criticism?</q> Without criticism it would be nothing but one <q>hosannah.</q>
But nothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah
must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on, in the
same style. But I don't meddle in that, I didn't create it, I am not
answerable for it. Well, they've chosen their scapegoat, they've
made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible.
We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask for
annihilation. No, live, I am told, for there'd be nothing without
you. If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would
happen. There would be no events without you, and there must
be events. So against the grain I serve to produce events and do
what's irrational because I am commanded to. For all their indisputable
intelligence, men take this farce as something serious, and
that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course ... but then they
live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for suffering is life.
Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? It would be
transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but
tedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don't live.
I am x in an indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in
life who has lost all beginning and end, and who has even forgotten
his own name. You are laughing&mdash; no, you are not laughing, you
are angry again. You are for ever angry, all you care about is intelligence,
but I repeat again that I would give away all this super-stellar
life, all the ranks and honors, simply to be transformed into
<pb n='727'/><anchor id='Pg727'/>
the soul of a merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles
at God's shrine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then even you don't believe in God?</q> said Ivan, with a smile of
hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>What can I say?&mdash;that is, if you are in earnest&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there a God or not?</q> Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I
don't know. There! I've said it now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know, but you see God? No, you are not some one
apart, you are myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish,
you are my fancy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would
be true. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Je pense, donc je suis</foreign>,
I know that for a fact; all the rest,
all these worlds, God and even Satan&mdash;all that is not proved, to my
mind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of
myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed
for ever: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping
up to beat me directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better tell me some anecdote!</q> said Ivan miserably.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend,
not an anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say,
yet you don't believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one
like that. We are all in a muddle over there now and all through
your science. Once there used to be atoms, five senses, four elements,
and then everything hung together somehow. There were
atoms in the ancient world even, but since we've learned that you've
discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil
knows what, we had to lower our crest. There's a regular muddle,
and, above all, superstition, scandal; there's as much scandal among
us as among you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed,
for we have our secret police department where private information
is received. Well, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages&mdash;not
yours, but ours&mdash;and no one believes it even among us, except
the old ladies of eighteen stone, not your old ladies I mean, but ours.
We've everything you have, I am revealing one of our secrets out
of friendship for you; though it's forbidden. This legend is about
Paradise. There was, they say, here on earth a thinker and philosopher.
He rejected everything, <q>laws, conscience, faith,</q> and,
<pb n='728'/><anchor id='Pg728'/>
above all, the future life. He died; he expected to go straight to
darkness and death and he found a future life before him. He was
astounded and indignant. <q>This is against my principles!</q> he said.
And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me,
I am just repeating what I heard myself, it's only a legend ...
he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (we've
adopted the metric system, you know) and when he has finished
that quadrillion, the gates of heaven would be opened to him and
he'll be forgiven&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what tortures have you in the other world besides the
quadrillion kilometers?</q> asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.
</p>

<p>
<q>What tortures? Ah, don't ask. In old days we had all sorts,
but now they have taken chiefly to moral punishments&mdash;<q>the stings
of conscience</q> and all that nonsense. We got that, too, from you,
from the softening of your manners. And who's the better for it?
Only those who have got no conscience, for how can they be tortured
by conscience when they have none? But decent people who
have conscience and a sense of honor suffer for it. Reforms, when
the ground has not been prepared for them, especially if they are
institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but mischief! The
ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemned to
the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down
across the road. <q>I won't go, I refuse on principle!</q> Take the soul
of an enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the
prophet Jonah, who sulked for three days and nights in the belly
of the whale, and you get the character of that thinker who lay
across the road.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he lie on there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not
laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo!</q> cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now
he was listening with an unexpected curiosity. <q>Well, is he lying
there now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's the point, that he isn't. He lay there almost a thousand
years and then he got up and went on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What an ass!</q> cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming
to be pondering something intently. <q>Does it make any difference
<pb n='729'/><anchor id='Pg729'/>
whether he lies there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers?
It would take a billion years to walk it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Much more than that. I haven't got a pencil and paper or I
could work it out. But he got there long ago, and that's where
the story begins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to
do it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present
earth may have been repeated a billion times. Why, it's become
extinct, been frozen; cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into
its elements, again <q>the water above the firmament,</q> then again a
comet, again a sun, again from the sun it becomes earth&mdash;and the
same sequence may have been repeated endlessly and exactly the
same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably tedious&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well, what happened when he arrived?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked
in, before he had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to
my thinking his watch must have long dissolved into its elements on
the way), he cried out that those two seconds were worth walking
not a quadrillion kilometers but a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised
to the quadrillionth power! In fact, he sang <q>hosannah</q> and overdid
it so, that some persons there of lofty ideas wouldn't shake hands
with him at first&mdash;he'd become too rapidly reactionary, they said.
The Russian temperament. I repeat, it's a legend. I give it for
what it's worth. So that's the sort of ideas we have on such subjects
even now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've caught you!</q> Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight,
as though he had succeeded in remembering something at last.
<q>That anecdote about the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I
was seventeen then, I was at the high school. I made up that
anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin, it was at
Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic that I couldn't have
taken it from anywhere. I thought I'd forgotten it ... but I've
unconsciously recalled it&mdash;I recalled it myself&mdash;it was not you
telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like
that even when people are being taken to execution ... it's come
back to me in a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream,
not a living creature!</q>
</p>

<pb n='730'/><anchor id='Pg730'/>

<p>
<q>From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,</q>
laughed the gentleman, <q>I am convinced that you believe in me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not in the slightest! I haven't a hundredth part of a grain of
faith in you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses
perhaps are the strongest. Confess that you have faith even to the
ten-thousandth of a grain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not for one minute,</q> cried Ivan furiously. <q>But I should like to
believe in you,</q> he added strangely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aha! There's an admission! But I am good-natured. I'll come
to your assistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me.
I told you your anecdote you'd forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy
your faith in me completely.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of
your existence!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and
disbelief&mdash;is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as
you are, that it's better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you
are inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling
you that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and
I have my motive in it. It's the new method. As soon as you disbelieve
in me completely, you'll begin assuring me to my face that
I am not a dream but a reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained
my object, which is an honorable one. I shall sow in you
only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree&mdash;and
such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will long to enter the ranks
of <q>the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women,</q> for that
is what you are secretly longing for. You'll dine on locusts, you'll
wander into the wilderness to save your soul!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then it's for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it,
you scoundrel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you
are!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and
prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown
with moss?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I've done nothing else. One forgets the whole
world and all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he
<pb n='731'/><anchor id='Pg731'/>
is a very precious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes
worth a whole constellation. We have our system of reckoning, you
know. The conquest is priceless! And some of them, on my word,
are not inferior to you in culture, though you won't believe it.
They can contemplate such depths of belief and disbelief at the same
moment that sometimes it really seems that they are within a hair's-breadth
of being <q>turned upside down,</q> as the actor Gorbunov says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, did you get your nose pulled?</q><note place='foot'>Literally: <q>Did you
get off with a long nose made at you?</q>&mdash;a proverbial
expression in Russia for failure.</note>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow,</q> observed the visitor sententiously, <q>it's better
to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an
afflicted marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated
by a specialist) in confession to his spiritual father&mdash;a Jesuit. I was
present, it was simply charming. <q>Give me back my nose!</q> he said,
and he beat his breast. <q>My son,</q> said the priest evasively, <q>all things
are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of
Providence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary,
though unapparent, benefits. If stern destiny has deprived
you of your nose, it's to your advantage that no one can ever pull
you by your nose.</q> <q>Holy father, that's no comfort,</q> cried the
despairing marquis. <q>I'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every
day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.</q> <q>My son,</q> sighs
the priest, <q>you can't expect every blessing at once. This is murmuring
against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you,
for if you repine as you repined just now, declaring you'd be glad
to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has
already been fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you
were led by the nose.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool, how stupid!</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that's
the genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word
for word as I've told you. It happened lately and gave me a great
deal of trouble. The unhappy young man shot himself that very
night when he got home. I was by his side till the very last moment.
Those Jesuit confessionals are really my most delightful
diversion at melancholy moments. Here's another incident that happened
only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of twenty&mdash;a
<pb n='732'/><anchor id='Pg732'/>
buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth
water&mdash;comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her
sin into the grating. <q>Why, my daughter, have you fallen again
already?</q> cries the priest. <q>O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not
the same man this time, how long is this going on? Aren't you
ashamed!</q> <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ah, mon père</foreign>,</q>
answers the sinner with tears of penitence, <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ça
lui fait tant de plaisir, et à moi si peu de peine!</foreign></q> Fancy,
such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of nature, better
than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on the spot and
was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the priest
at the grating making an appointment with her for the evening&mdash;though
he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! It was
nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turning
up your nose again? Angry again? I don't know how to
please you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting
nightmare,</q> Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition.
<q>I am bored with you, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give
anything to be able to shake you off!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand of me
<q>everything great and noble</q> and you'll see how well we shall get
on,</q> said the gentleman impressively. <q>You are really angry with
me for not having appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and
lightning, with scorched wings, but have shown myself in such a
modest form. You are wounded, in the first place, in your esthetic
feelings, and, secondly, in your pride. How could such a vulgar
devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is that romantic
strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can't help it,
young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of
appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the
Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I
was positively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me for
daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least,
the Polar Star or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid,
but, mercy on us! I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence.
Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil, but did only
good. Well, he can say what he likes, it's quite the opposite with
me. I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth
<pb n='733'/><anchor id='Pg733'/>
and genuinely desires good. I was there when the Word, Who died
on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul
of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim
singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the
seraphim which shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you
by all that's sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah
with them all. The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken
from my lips ... you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable
I am. But common sense&mdash;oh, a most unhappy trait in
my character&mdash;kept me in due bounds and I let the moment pass!
For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have happened
after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been
extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so,
solely from a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced
to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody
takes all the credit of what's good for Himself, and nothing
but nastiness is left for me. But I don't envy the honor of a life
of idle imposture, I am not ambitious. Why am I, of all creatures
in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be
kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such consequences
sometimes? I know, of course, there's a secret in it, but
they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps, seeing
the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable
minus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme
throughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the
end of everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who
would take them in? I know that at the end of all things I shall
be reconciled. I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret.
But till that happens I am sulking and fulfill my destiny though it's
against the grain&mdash;that is, to ruin thousands for the sake of saving
one. How many souls have had to be ruined and how many honorable
reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man,
Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days! Yes, till
the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for me&mdash;one, their
truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the other
my own. And there's no knowing which will turn out the better....
Are you asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I might well be,</q> Ivan groaned angrily. <q>All my stupid ideas&mdash;outgrown,
<pb n='734'/><anchor id='Pg734'/>
thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead
carcass&mdash;you present to me as something new!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you
by my literary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn't bad,
was it? And then that ironical tone <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à la</foreign>
Heine, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget
a flunkey like you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young
Russian gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature
and art, the author of a promising poem entitled
<hi rend='italic'>The Grand Inquisitor</hi>.
I was only thinking of him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I forbid you to speak of <hi rend='italic'>The Grand Inquisitor</hi>,</q>
cried Ivan, crimson with shame.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the <hi rend='italic'>Geological Cataclysm</hi>. Do you remember? That was
a poem, now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, or I'll kill you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat
myself to that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young
friends, quivering with eagerness for life! <q>There are new men,</q>
you decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, <q>they
propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid
fellows! they didn't ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need
be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man,
that's how we have to set to work. It's that, that we must begin
with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon
as men have all of them denied God&mdash;and I believe that period,
analogous with geological periods, will come to pass&mdash;the old conception
of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and,
what's more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew.
Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy
and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up with a
spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From
hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will
and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in
doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of
heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept
death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that
it's useless for him to repine at life's being a moment, and he will
<pb n='735'/><anchor id='Pg735'/>
love his brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient
only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness
will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams
of eternal love beyond the grave</q>... and so on and so on in the
same style. Charming!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his
ears, but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible
that such a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined
and humanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man's
inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand
years, every one who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately
order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, <q>all
things are lawful</q> for him. What's more, even if this period never
comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality,
the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is the only
one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position, he may
lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old
slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God
stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost
place ... <q>all things are lawful</q> and that's the end of it!
That's all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you
want a moral sanction for doing it? But that's our modern Russian
all over. He can't bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction.
He is so in love with truth&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence,
speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But
he did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from
the table and flung it at the orator.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ah, mais c'est bête enfin</foreign>,</q>
cried the latter, jumping up from the
sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. <q>He remembers
Luther's inkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at
a dream! It's like a woman! I suspected you were only pretending
to stop up your ears.</q>
</p>

<p>
A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window.
Ivan jumped up from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you hear? You'd better open,</q> cried the visitor; <q>it's your
<pb n='736'/><anchor id='Pg736'/>
brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I'll
be bound!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming,
and of course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings
<q>news,</q></q> Ivan exclaimed frantically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Open, open to him. There's a snowstorm and he is your brother.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait?
C'est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window,
but something seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained
every effort to break his chains, but in vain. The knocking at the
window grew louder and louder. At last the chains were broken
and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked round him wildly.
Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just thrown at
his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one on
the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on
persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his
dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened
just now!</q> cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened
the movable pane.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I told you not to come,</q> he cried fiercely to his brother.
<q>In two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,</q> Alyosha answered
from the yard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come round to the steps, I'll open at once,</q> said Ivan, going to
open the door to Alyosha.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter X. <q>It Was He Who Said That</q></head>

<p>
Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago
Marya Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him
Smerdyakov had taken his own life. <q>I went in to clear away the
samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall.</q> On Alyosha's
inquiring whether she had informed the police, she answered that
<pb n='737'/><anchor id='Pg737'/>
she had told no one, <q>but I flew straight to you, I've run all the
way.</q> She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking
like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he found
Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: <q>I destroy my
life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.</q>
Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police
captain and told him all about it. <q>And from him I've come straight
to you,</q> said Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's
face. He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as
though struck by something in his expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> he cried suddenly, <q>you must be terribly ill. You
look and don't seem to understand what I tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a good thing you came,</q> said Ivan, as though brooding, and
not hearing Alyosha's exclamation. <q>I knew he had hanged himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me.
He told me so just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same
brooding tone, looking at the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is <emph>he</emph>?</q> asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's slipped away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a <q>pure
cherub.</q> Dmitri calls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous
rapture of the seraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole
constellation. But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical
molecule. There's a constellation of the Lion and the Sun. Don't
you know it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, sit down,</q> said Alyosha in alarm. <q>For goodness' sake,
sit down on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow,
that's right. Would you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps
it will do you good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down
there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not here. Don't worry yourself. I know where it is&mdash;here,</q>
said Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused,
by Ivan's dressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan
<pb n='738'/><anchor id='Pg738'/>
looked strangely at the towel: recollection seemed to come back to
him for an instant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay</q>&mdash;he got up from the sofa&mdash;<q>an hour ago I took that new
towel from there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and
threw it down here ... How is it it's dry? There was no other.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You put that towel on your head?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ...
Why have the candles burnt down so? What's the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nearly twelve.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, no!</q> Ivan cried suddenly. <q>It was not a dream. He
was here; he was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked
at the window, I threw a glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute.
I was asleep last time, but this dream was not a dream. It has
happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha ... yet they are
not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ... though I
am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is
frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.</q> Ivan laughed suddenly
and began pacing about the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?</q> Alyosha
asked anxiously again.
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil! He's taken to visiting me. He's been here twice,
almost three times. He taunted me with being angry at his being
a simple devil and not Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and
lightning. But he is not Satan: that's a lie. He is an impostor.
He is simply a devil&mdash;a paltry, trivial devil. He goes to the baths.
If you undressed him, you'd be sure to find he had a tail, long and
smooth like a Danish dog's, a yard long, dun color.... Alyosha,
you are cold. You've been in the snow. Would you like some tea?
What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some?
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est à ne pas
mettre un chien dehors.</foreign>...</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded
Ivan to sit down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He
sat down beside him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What were you telling me just now about Lise?</q> Ivan began
again. (He was becoming very talkative.) <q>I like Lise. I said
something nasty about her. It was a lie. I like her ... I am
afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more afraid of her than of anything.
On account of the future. She will cast me off to-morrow
<pb n='739'/><anchor id='Pg739'/>
and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining Mitya
from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it's not
so. To-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan't hang
myself. Do you know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it
because I am base? I am not a coward. Is it from love of life?
How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself? Yes, it was
<emph>he</emph> told me so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?</q>
asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him
away. You did drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived.
I love your face, Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face?
And <emph>he</emph> is myself, Alyosha. All that's base in me, all that's mean and
contemptible. Yes, I am a romantic. He guessed it ... though
it's a libel. He is frightfully stupid; but it's to his advantage. He
has cunning, animal cunning&mdash;he knew how to infuriate me. He
kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was how he made
me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great
deal that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned
it to myself. Do you know, Alyosha,</q> Ivan added in an intensely
earnest and confidential tone, <q>I should be awfully glad to think
that it was <emph>he</emph> and not I.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has worn you out,</q> said Alyosha, looking compassionately at
his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so
cleverly. <q>Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for
myself. Why am I tormented by it? From habit. From the
universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years. So let
us give it up, and we shall be gods.</q> It was he said that, it was he
said that!</q>
</p>
