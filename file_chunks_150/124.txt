
<p>
<q>What is it he cannot?</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>that he absolutely
cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come
in or not? Will you receive me as your guest?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are welcome with all my heart,</q> answered the Superior.
<q>Gentlemen!</q> he added, <q>I venture to beg you most earnestly to
lay aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family
harmony&mdash;with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, it is impossible!</q> cried Miüsov, beside himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible
for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep
with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain.
You stung him by what you said about family harmony,
Father Superior, he does not admit he is my relation. That's right,
isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you mean me?</q> muttered Maximov, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I mean you,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. <q>Who else?
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von
Sohn was? It was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house
of harlotry&mdash;I believe that is what such places are called among
you&mdash;he was killed and robbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he
<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>
was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the
luggage van, and while they were nailing him up, the harlots sang
songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that
very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is happening? What's this?</q> voices were heard in the
group of monks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go,</q> cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, excuse me,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another
step into the room. <q>Allow me to finish. There in the cell
you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of
eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miüsov, my relation, prefers
to have <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plus de noblesse que de sincérité</foreign>
in his words, but I prefer in mine <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plus de
sincérité que de noblesse</foreign>, and&mdash;damn the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>noblesse</foreign>!
That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though
I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor,
and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in
Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else.
I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,
Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare,
and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have
been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give
you the last act of the performance. You know how things are
with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so
it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again.
Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a great
sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but
there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can it be
right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to
confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and
so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one
that I did this and that ... well, you understand what&mdash;sometimes
it would not be proper to talk about it&mdash;so it is really a scandal!
No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants,
I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod,
and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.</q>
</p>

<p>
We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look
for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors
which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our
<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>
monastery, but in others where the institution of elders existed)
that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment
of the authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament
of confession and so on and so on&mdash;absurd charges which had died
away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had
caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the current
of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,
prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not
understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for
on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in
the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind.
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But
as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking
absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience,
and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense.
And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would
be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,
and plunged forward blindly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How disgraceful!</q> cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me!</q> said the Father Superior. <q>It was said of old,
<q>Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil
sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the
correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.</q>
And so we humbly thank you, honored guest!</q> and he made Fyodor
Pavlovitch a low bow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut&mdash;sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old
phrases and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We
know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart,
as in Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Robbers</hi>. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want
the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that
I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you
expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will
come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in
the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a
monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward
up aloft for it&mdash;you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too,
Father Superior. What have they got here?</q> He went up to the
table. <q>Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie,
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the
bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided
it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing
earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the
tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy fathers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is too disgraceful!</q> said Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
Father Païssy kept obstinately silent. Miüsov rushed from the
room, and Kalganov after him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not
coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't
come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep
your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my
revenge for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured.</q> He
thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling.
<q>This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost
me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,
against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories
about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of
Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand,
nor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get
out of me!</q>
</p>

<p>
It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any
great part in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.
But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was
for one moment almost believing it himself. He was so touched he
was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was
time to draw back.
</p>

<p>
The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again
spoke impressively:
</p>

<p>
<q>It is written again, <q>Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor
that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded
and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.</q> And so will we.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.
Bethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son,
Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan
Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to
follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see
me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst;
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We
will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've
cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.</q> He
went out, shouting and gesticulating.
</p>

<p>
It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey!</q> his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him.
<q>You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow
and mattress, and leave no trace behind.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.
Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan
was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to
say good-by to Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible
scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode.
Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran
up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw
him running. He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put
his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and
clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in. <q>I am going
with you!</q> he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a
look of reckless glee in his face. <q>Take me, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. <q>Did I not say he
was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why,
how did you tear yourself away? What did you <hi rend='italic'>vonsohn</hi> there?
And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a
brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you,
brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun.
He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von
Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the
box, von Sohn!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave
Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was
quite by chance he did not fall.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on!</q> Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you
do that?</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.
</p>

<p>
But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you are a fellow,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
</p>

<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>

<p>
After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, <q>Why,
it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you
approved of it. Why are you angry now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,</q> Ivan
snapped sullenly.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>A drop of brandy would be nice now,</q> he observed sententiously,
but Ivan made no response.
</p>

<p>
<q>You shall have some, too, when we get home.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan was still silent.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you
will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away
stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.

<head>Book III. The Sensualists</head>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter I. In The Servants' Quarters</head>

<p>
The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the
town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking
old house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was
roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all
sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases. There
were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike
them. <q>One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone in the
evening,</q> he used to say. It was his habit to send the servants
away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone. The
lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor Pavlovitch
used to have the cooking done there, although there was a kitchen
in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter and
summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The
house was built for a large family; there was room for five times
as many, with their servants. But at the time of our story there
was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son
Ivan. And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory,
and his old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov. Of
these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said
something already. He was firm and determined and went blindly
and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought by any
reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that it
was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife,
Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her
life, yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the
serfs. She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little
shop in Moscow with their small savings. But Grigory decided then,
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
once for all, that <q>the woman's talking nonsense, for every woman
is dishonest,</q> and that they ought not to leave their old master,
whatever he might be, for <q>that was now their duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you understand what duty is?</q> he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why
it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand,</q> Marfa answered
firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold
your tongue.</q>
</p>

<p>
And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch
promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory
knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his master.
It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an
obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong
enough <q>in some of the affairs of life,</q> as he expressed it, he found
himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other
emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them.
There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And
that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most
trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor
Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's
intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him a
good lecture. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch
was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle
and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained
the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted,
which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a
moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often
cruel in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was
sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious
terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form.
<q>My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times,</q> he used to
say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand,
in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and
unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his
secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that, not to
oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him with
anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need,
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
to defend him&mdash;from whom? From somebody unknown, but
terrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there
was <emph>another</emph> man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him
in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange
some quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old
servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry,
he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that
Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and
fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch
would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would
soon let him go again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he
had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and
sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had happened
to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha <q>pierced
his heart</q> by <q>living with him, seeing everything and blaming
nothing.</q> Moreover, Alyosha brought with him something his
father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt
for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected
devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was a
complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family
ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till
then loved nothing but <q>evil.</q> When Alyosha had left him, he
confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not
till then been willing to learn.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaïda
Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of
Dmitri, and that he had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna,
the poor <q>crazy woman,</q> against his master and any one who
chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy
wife had become something sacred to him, so that even now,
twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to her
from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,
Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his
words, without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight
whether he loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love
her, and she knew it.
</p>

<p>
Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,
cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>
in worldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything
without question or complaint ever since her marriage, and respected
him for his spiritual superiority. It was remarkable how little they
spoke to one another in the course of their lives, and only of the
most necessary daily affairs. The grave and dignified Grigory
thought over all his cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna
had long grown used to knowing that he did not need her
advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took
it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once,
and then only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's
marriage with Adelaïda Ivanovna, the village girls and
women&mdash;at that time serfs&mdash;were called together before the house
to sing and dance. They were beginning <q>In the Green Meadows,</q>
when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and
danced <q>the Russian Dance,</q> not in the village fashion, but as she
had danced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich
Miüsov family, in their private theater, where the actors were taught
to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his
wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave
her a lesson, pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating
was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
</p>

<p>
God had not blessed them with children. One child was born
but it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of
showing it. When Adelaïda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took
Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his hair and washed
him in a tub with his own hands, and looked after him for almost
a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for
which the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in the
face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his
own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth.
When it was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The
baby had six fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was
not only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the
garden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen
garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean-time
Grigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage
where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god-father, he suddenly
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
announced that the baby <q>ought not to be christened at all.</q>
He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing
with dull intentness at the priest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not?</q> asked the priest with good-humored surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because it's a dragon,</q> muttered Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>A dragon? What dragon?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory did not speak for some time. <q>It's a confusion of nature,</q>
he muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to
say more.
</p>

<p>
They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory
prayed earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child
remained unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long
as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to
notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when,
at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid
the child in its little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when
they were filling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and
bowed down to the earth. He did not for years afterwards mention
his child, nor did Marfa speak of the baby before him, and, even if
Grigory were not present, she never spoke of it above a whisper.
Marfa observed that, from the day of the burial, he devoted himself
to <q>religion,</q> and took to reading the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>,
for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and always putting on his
big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read aloud, only
perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow
got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of <q>the God-fearing
Father Isaac the Syrian,</q> which he read persistently for
years together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing
and loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to
the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood.
He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go
over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him
an expression of still greater gravity.
</p>

<p>
He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his
deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design,
been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which,
as he said later, had left a <q>stamp</q> upon his soul. It happened that,
on the very night after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
by the wail of a new-born baby. She was frightened and waked
her husband. He listened and said he thought it was more like
some one groaning, <q>it might be a woman.</q> He got up and dressed.
It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he
distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from
the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no
other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong,
high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern,
took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of
his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and
that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the
garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from
the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were
the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath-house, he
saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about
the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of
Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-house
and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the
baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to
speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter II. Lizaveta</head>

<p>
There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly,
and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This
Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, <q>not five foot within a wee bit,</q>
as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after
her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy
and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek
expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted,
wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost
black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap
on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits
of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the
ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman
with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead.
Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever
she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in
the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially
dear to God. Ilya's employers, and many others in the town,
especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better, and always
rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter.
But, although she allowed them to dress her up without resisting,
she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch, and
taking off all that had been given her&mdash;kerchief, sheepskin, skirt
or boots&mdash;she left them there and walked away barefoot in her
smock as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor
of the province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw
Lizaveta, and was wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And
though he was told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young
woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a
breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor
went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her
father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of
the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one
seemed to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of
our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She
would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every
one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were given a
copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms-jug of
the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market,
she would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would
stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the
lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything
but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,
where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept
watch on her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles
overlooked by them, she would not have touched a farthing. She
scarcely ever went to church. She slept either in the church porch
or climbed over a hurdle (there are many hurdles instead of fences
to this day in our town) into a kitchen garden. She used at least
once a week to turn up <q>at home,</q> that is at the house of her
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>
father's former employers, and in the winter went there every night,
and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People were amazed
that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to it, and,
although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some of
the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but
that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from
time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have
been proud?
</p>

<p>
It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September
(many years ago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from
the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions.
They passed through the <q>back-way,</q> which led between the back
gardens of the houses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads
out on to the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were
accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles and burdocks under
the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look
at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness.
It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry
whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a
woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance
that it was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was
among them, sprang forward and declared that it was by no means
impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it,
and so on.... It is true that at that time he was overdoing his
part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and entertain
the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality
he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time when
he had received the news of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and,
with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly
that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of
him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion;
and one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The
others repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with
the utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way. Later on,
Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them, and perhaps
it was so, no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew. But
five or six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and
sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find out
<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>
who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a
terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no
other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of
that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still
among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the
father of grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the
tale, even if there had been any foundation for it. But rumor
pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at
him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not
have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he
was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle
of the officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.
</p>

<p>
At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He
provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded
in bringing some people round to his side. <q>It's the wench's own
fault,</q> he asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict,
who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us,
as he had hidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible,
for it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just
at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people. But this
affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy
from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A
well-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take
her into her house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go
out until after the confinement. They kept a constant watch over
her, but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day,
and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her
condition, she managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained
a mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted
over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The
most likely explanation is that it happened naturally&mdash;that Lizaveta,
accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow
managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had
leapt down, injuring herself.
</p>

<p>
Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran
to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby,
but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home,
and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. <q>A child of God&mdash;an
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
orphan is akin to all,</q> he said, <q>and to us above others. Our
little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son
and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to
which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor).
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it
amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility.
The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later
on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him
Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.
</p>

<p>
So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant,
and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our
story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something
of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention
so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back
to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.

<head>Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;In Verse</head>

<p>
Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the
command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But
in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his
way. He went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father
had been doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way
he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten
to add that his father's shouts, commanding him to return home
<q>with his mattress and pillow</q> did not frighten him in the least.
He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely
<q>a flourish</q> to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in
our town who was celebrating his name-day with a party of friends,
getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own
crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife's clothes, and
finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of
course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers.
Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery
<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>
next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded
that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt
him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would
want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could
hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without
question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him,
and worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was
the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently
entreated him in the note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to
come and see her about something. This request and the necessity
of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart, and this
feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite
of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father Superior's. He was
not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak of and
what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a
woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life,
from early childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with
women. He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He
had been afraid of her from the first time he saw her. He had only
seen her two or three times, and had only chanced to say a few
words to her. He thought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious
girl. It was not her beauty which troubled him, but something
else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension
itself. The girl's aims were of the noblest, he knew that.
She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,
though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha
recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments,
a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her
house.
</p>

<p>
He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate
a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father.
Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had
a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with
her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri
before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he
could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and
he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute,
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed
gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the
direction of his terrible lady.
</p>

<p>
He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then
across the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our
town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And
meanwhile his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not yet
forgotten his command. He might be unreasonable, and so he had
to make haste to get there and back. So he decided to take a short
cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the ground. This
meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other
people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted
him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.
</p>

<p>
He had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging
to a little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of
this house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with
her daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals'
families in Petersburg. Now she had been at home a year, looking
after her sick mother. She always dressed up in fine clothes, though
her old mother and she had sunk into such poverty that they went
every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which
Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up for
soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even
had a long train&mdash;a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin,
who always knew everything that was going on in the town. He
had forgotten it as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the
garden, he remembered the dress with the train, raised his head,
which had been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite
unexpected.
</p>

<p>
Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something,
was leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously
afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha
ran up to the hurdle.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,</q>
Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper. <q>Climb in here quickly!
How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
the hurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help
him jump. Tucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle
with the agility of a bare-legged street urchin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done! Now come along,</q> said Mitya in an enthusiastic
whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where?</q> whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself
in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The
garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no one here. Why do you whisper?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!</q> cried Dmitri at the top of
his voice. <q rend='pre'>You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here
in secret, and on the watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's
a secret, I began whispering like a fool, when there's no need. Let
us go. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l>Glory to God in the world,</l>
<l>Glory to God in me ...</l>

<p>
<q rend='post'>I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.</q>
</p>

<p>
The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees
only along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees,
maples, limes and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an
empty grass space, from which several hundredweight of hay was
carried in the summer. The garden was let out for a few roubles
for the summer. There were also plantations of raspberries and currants
and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen garden
had been planted lately near the house.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden.
There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant,
elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green
summer-house, blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work,
but there was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows
when this summer-house was built. There was a tradition that it
had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called
von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It was all in decay,
the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled
musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed
in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which
it was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw
half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's brandy,</q> Mitya laughed. <q rend='pre'>I see your look: <q>He's drinking
again!</q> Distrust the apparition.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post'>I'm not drinking, I'm only <q>indulging,</q> as that pig, your Rakitin,
says. He'll be a civil councilor one day, but he'll always talk about
<q>indulging.</q> Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and
press you to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world&mdash;in
reality&mdash;in re-al-i-ty&mdash;(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!</q>
</p>

<p>
He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.
</p>

<p>
<q>No one but you and one <q>jade</q> I have fallen in love with, to
my ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in
love with a woman and yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk
about it gayly still. Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside
you and look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and
I'll go on talking, for the time has come. But on reflection, you
know, I'd better speak quietly, for here&mdash;here&mdash;you can never tell
what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, <q>the
story will be continued.</q> Why have I been longing for you? Why
have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's
five days since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I
can tell everything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow
I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending
and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling
down a precipice into a pit? That's just how I'm falling, but not in
a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At least, I
am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not enjoyment though, but ecstasy.
Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish
spirit&mdash;whatever it is! Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine,
how clear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it's still summer;
four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness! Where were you
going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's
first.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny
of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and
to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with
father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted
to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you really mean to send me?</q> cried Alyosha with a distressed
expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once.
But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's why
you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is her note.</q> Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya
looked through it quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for
sending him by the back-way, and he came to me like the golden
fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen,
brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some
one. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell an
angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and
judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that some one above
me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything
on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,
and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and
says, <q>Do this for me</q>&mdash;some favor never asked before that could
only be asked on one's deathbed&mdash;would that other refuse, if he were
a friend or a brother?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste! H'm!... Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you
hurry and worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the
world has taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't
understand ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you
didn't understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying?
<q>Be noble, O man!</q>&mdash;who says that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed,
his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were
silent.
</p>

<p>

But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I

the world is a riddle! And whenever I've happened to sink into the

that poem about Ceres and man. Has it reformed me? Never!
For I'm a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong

degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very
depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be
accursed. Let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the
veil in which my God is shrouded. Though I may be following
the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the
joy without which the world cannot stand.

<q rend='post'>I am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All we
Karamazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives
in you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests,
because sensual lust is a tempest&mdash;worse than a tempest! Beauty
is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been
fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but
riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side
by side. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I've thought a
lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many
riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as we can,
and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't endure
the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the
ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's
still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul
does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be
on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth
and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed. I'd have him
narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it! What to the
mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind
beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The
awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and
the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man.
But a man always talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to
facts.</q>

<head>Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;In Anecdote</head>

<p>
<q>I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I
spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That's
a swinish invention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if
there was, I didn't need money simply for <emph>that</emph>. With me money is
an accessory, the overflow of my heart, the framework. To-day she
would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out of the streets in her
place. I entertained them both. I threw away money by the handful
on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the ladies,
too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be
pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of
them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths,
little dark back-alleys behind the main road&mdash;there one finds adventures
and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking
figuratively, brother. In the town I was in, there were no such
back-alleys in the literal sense, but morally there were. If you were
like me, you'd know what that means. I loved vice, I loved the
ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a
noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole lot
of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and
I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her to kiss me. She
was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature.
She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She thought,
poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer
(I was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't say a word
to her for five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we
were always having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how
they glowed with fire&mdash;a fire of gentle indignation. This game
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul. Five months
later she married an official and left the town, still angry, and still,
perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily. Observe that
I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low desires,
and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable. You're blushing; your
eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this was
nothing much&mdash;wayside blossoms <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
la</foreign> Paul de Kock&mdash;though the
cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect
album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I
tried to break it off without quarreling. And I never gave them
away. I never bragged of one of them. But that's enough. You
can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense.
No, I'm going to tell you something more curious; and don't be surprised
that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You say that because I blushed,</q> Alyosha said suddenly. <q>I
wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I
blushed because I am the same as you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You? Come, that's going a little too far!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not too far,</q> said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea
was not a new one). <q>The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom
step, and you're above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's
how I see it. But it's all the same. Absolutely the same in kind.
Any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then one ought not to step on at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Any one who can help it had better not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you
touch me so. That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told
me once that she'd devour you one day. There, there, I won't!
From this field of corruption fouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy,
also befouled by flies, that is by every sort of vileness. Although
the old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was
something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and
then it did not come off. The old man who has reproached me
with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never
told any one about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course&mdash;Ivan
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But
Ivan's a tomb.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's a tomb?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened with great attention.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,
like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in
the little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be
rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other
ways as well. Although they shook their heads over me, they
liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike
to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends,
and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn't do me
much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with
proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was
really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two
wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left
a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of
four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father
and an aunt, her mother's sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate;
the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things about
people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than
Agafya&mdash;fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn't
bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full
figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had not
married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but
was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in <q>that</q> way,
it was pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women
quite innocently. I used to talk to her with shocking frankness,
and she only laughed. Many women like such freedom, and she
was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one
could never think of her as a young lady. She and her aunt lived
in her father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting
themselves on an equality with other people. She was a general
favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever dressmaker.
She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without asking
for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn't refuse.
The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained
the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I
arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the
expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty,
who had just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second
daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second
wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although, as
I learnt on good authority, she too brought the colonel no money.
She had connections, and that was all. There may have been expectations,
but they had come to nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit,
the whole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies&mdash;two <q>Excellencies</q>
and a colonel's wife&mdash;and all the rest following their
lead, at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honor.
She was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tableaux vivants</foreign>
in aid of distressed governesses. I took no notice, I went
on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at the time set all the
town talking. I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the
battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained
her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an evening
party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed her
lips scornfully. <q>Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,</q> thought I. I
behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I
was conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt
that <q>Katenka</q> was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a
person of character, proud and really high-principled; above all, she
had education and intellect, and I had neither. You think I meant
to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge myself,
because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to feel it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel
put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father
sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed
giving up all claims upon him&mdash;settling our accounts, so to speak,
and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more. I didn't understand
a word of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha, till
the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been able to
make head or tail of my money affairs with father. But never
mind that, we'll talk of it later.</q>
</p>

<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling
me something that interested me immensely. The authorities,
I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected
of irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise
for him. And then the commander of the division arrived,
and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was
ordered to retire. I won't tell you how it all happened. He had
enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the
town towards him and all his family. His friends all turned their
backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya Ivanovna,
with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, <q>Do you know
there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your
father's accounts?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general
was here not long ago, and everything was all right.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Then it was, but now it isn't.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She was terribly scared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Don't frighten me!</q> she said. <q>Who told you so?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Don't be uneasy,</q> I said, <q>I won't tell any one. You know
I'm as silent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of <q>possibilities,</q>
to add, that when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your
father, and he can't produce it, he'll be tried, and made to serve
as a common soldier in his old age, unless you like to send me
your young lady secretly. I've just had money paid me. I'll give
her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Ah, you scoundrel!</q>&mdash;that's what she said. <q>You wicked
scoundrel! How dare you!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her
once more that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple
creatures, Agafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved
like perfect angels all through this business. They genuinely adored
their <q>Katya,</q> thought her far above them, and waited on her, hand
and foot. But Agafya told her of our conversation. I found that
out afterwards. She didn't keep it back, and of course that was
all I wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion.
The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't
leave his room for two days, and didn't hand over the government
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
money. Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill. But I
knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the last
four years the money had never been in his hands except when the
Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend it to a
trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old
widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to
go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return
the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present from the
fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time (I heard all about
it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth
and one of the most vicious in the world)&mdash;this time, I say, Trifonov
brought nothing back from the fair. The lieutenant-colonel flew
to him. <q>I've never received any money from you, and couldn't
possibly have received any.</q> That was all the answer he got. So
now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel
round his head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it. All
at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order
to <q>hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.</q>
He signed the book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards),
stood up, saying he would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom,
loaded his double-barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot
off his right foot, fixed the gun against his chest, and began feeling
for the trigger with his foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had
told her, had her suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room
just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon him from behind,
threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling,
but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held
him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home,
it was getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had
dressed, brushed my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up
my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and facing me in the room
stood Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen
her in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged
with two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most
obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request
were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts. Of course I
grasped the position at once. She walked in and looked straight at
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>
me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her lips and round
her mouth I saw uncertainty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>My sister told me,</q> she began, <q>that you would give me 4,500
roubles if I came to you for it&mdash;myself. I have come ... give me
the money!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her
voice failed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it
quivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,</q> said Alyosha in
agitation.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened
I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a&mdash;Karamazov one. Once
I was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with
fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then&mdash;a
noxious insect, you understand? I looked her up and down.
You've seen her? She's a beauty. But she was beautiful in another
way then. At that moment she was beautiful because she was
noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her generosity
and sacrifice for her father, and I&mdash;a bug! And, scoundrel
as I was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She
was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous
thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense.
It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I
should act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of
pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I should have gone
next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end honorably, so
to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though I'm a
man of base desires, I'm honest. And at that very second some voice
seemed to whisper in my ear, <q>But when you come to-morrow to
make your proposal, that girl won't even see you; she'll order her
coachman to kick you out of the yard. <q>Publish it through all
the town,</q> she would say, <q>I'm not afraid of you.</q></q> I looked at
the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That is how it
would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from her face now that I
should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. I longed
to play her the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at her with a
sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with
a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.</q>
</p>

<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You've
been counting your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred,
if you like, with all my heart. But four thousand is not a sum to
throw away on such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no
purpose.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I should have lost the game, of course. She'd have run away.
But it would have been an infernal revenge. It would have been
worth it all. I'd have howled with regret all the rest of my life,
only to have played that trick. Would you believe it, it has never
happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her at
such a moment with hatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for
three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred&mdash;that hate which
is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane,
and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep
her long, don't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table,
opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles
(it was lying in a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in
silence, folded it, handed it to her, opened the door into the passage,
and, stepping back, made her a deep bow, a most respectful, a most
impressive bow, believe me! She shuddered all over, gazed at me
for a second, turned horribly pale&mdash;white as a sheet, in fact&mdash;and
all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently, bowed down to my
feet&mdash;not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow, with her
forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing
my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot;
why, I don't know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of
course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that
one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn't stab myself. I
only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard&mdash;which there
was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in
telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to
glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into
the human heart! Well, so much for that <q>adventure</q> with Katerina
Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you&mdash;no one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out
his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha
had to turn quite round to face him.

<head>Chapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;"Heels Up"</head>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> said Alyosha, <q>I understand the first half.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You understand the first half. That half is a drama,
and it was played out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is
being acted here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I understand nothing of that second half so far,</q> said
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I? Do you suppose I understand it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, Dmitri. There's one important question. Tell me, you
were betrothed, you are betrothed still?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We weren't betrothed at once, not for three months after that
adventure. The next day I told myself that the incident was closed,
concluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish
to make her an offer. On her side she gave no sign of life for the
six weeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one
action. The day after her visit the maid-servant slipped round
with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the
change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles
was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on
changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I
don't remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation.
I searched the packet for a pencil mark&mdash;n-nothing! Well, I spent
the rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was
obliged to reprimand me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to
the astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the
money untouched. He'd no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to
his bed, and, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he
died five days afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for
he had not had time to receive his discharge. Ten days after his
funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with her aunt and sister, went to Moscow.
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
And, behold, on the very day they went away (I hadn't seen
them, didn't see them off or take leave) I received a tiny note, a
sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line in pencil: <q>I will
write to you. Wait. K.</q> And that was all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes
changed with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness
of an Arabian fairy-tale. That general's widow, their nearest
relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and
next-of-kin&mdash;both died in the same week of small-pox. The old
lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her
one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in Katya's favor. But
that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for present use,
eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she liked
with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in
Moscow, later.</q>

<q>Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred
roubles. I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three
days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now. You
must read it. She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. <q>I
love you madly,</q> she says, <q>even if you don't love me, never mind.
Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way.
I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet. I want
to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.</q> Alyosha,
I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in
my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure
myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't
mind&mdash;that I don't mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it
was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears.
One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her being
rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar! I
mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it
slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him
all I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her.
Why do you look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes,
Ivan fell in love with her; he's in love with her still. I know that.
I did a stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one
stupid thing may be the saving of us all now. Oo! Don't you see
what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she respects him? When she
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>
compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like me, especially
after all that has happened here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not
a man like him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She loves her own <emph>virtue</emph>, not me.</q> The words broke involuntarily,
and almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a
minute later his eyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the
table violently with his fist.
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear, Alyosha,</q> he cried, with intense and genuine anger at
himself; <q>you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ
is God, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just
now, I know that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and
that these lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly
angel's. That's the tragedy of it&mdash;that I know that for certain.
What if any one does show off a bit? Don't I do it myself? And
yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how
he must be cursing nature now&mdash;with his intellect, too! To see the
preference given&mdash;to whom, to what? To a monster who, though
he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his debaucheries&mdash;and
before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man
like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a
girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's
ridiculous! I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of
course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny
will be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while
the undeserving one will vanish into his back-alley for ever&mdash;his
filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is at home and
where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with
enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I use
them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the
back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, Dmitri,</q> Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety.
<q>There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed
all the same, aren't you? How can you break off the
engagement if she, your betrothed, doesn't want to?</q>
</p>
