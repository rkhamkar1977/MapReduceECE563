cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation. Ivan
and the two monks took the leading share in it. Miüsov, too, was
trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the conversation.
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was evidently in the
background, and his remarks were treated with neglect, which increased
his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with
Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan
showed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is
progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores
us,</q> he thought.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be
quiet, had actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his
neighbor Miüsov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying
his discomfiture. He had been waiting for some time to pay off
old scores, and now he could not let the opportunity slip. Bending
over his shoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didn't you go away just now, after the <q>courteously kissing</q>?
Why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company?
It was because you felt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained
to vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence. Now you
won't go till you've displayed your intellect to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You again?... On the contrary, I'm just going.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be the last, the last of all to go!</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered
him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father
Zossima's return.
</p>

<p>
The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating
himself in his former place, looked at them all as though cordially
inviting them to go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his
face, saw that he was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort.
Of late he had been liable to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face
had the pallor that was common before such attacks, and his lips
were white. But he evidently did not want to break up the party.
He seemed to have some special object of his own in keeping them.
What object? Alyosha watched him intently.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,</q> said
Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan.
<q>He brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument
cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an
ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court,
and the scope of its jurisdiction.</q>
</p>

<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry I have not read your article, but I've heard of it,</q>
said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>He takes up a most interesting position,</q> continued the Father
Librarian. <q>As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently
quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's interesting. But in what sense?</q> Father Zossima asked
Ivan.
</p>

<p>
The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha
had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill
and apparently without the slightest
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>arrière-pensée</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
<q>I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is,
of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on
for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle,
and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent
or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation
of it. Compromise between the Church and State in such
questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible
in any real sense. My clerical opponent maintains that the
Church holds a precise and defined position in the State. I maintain,
on the contrary, that the Church ought to include the whole
State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and, if this is, for
some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in reality, to be
set up as the direct and chief aim of the future development of
Christian society!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perfectly true,</q> Father Païssy, the silent and learned monk,
assented with fervor and decision.
</p>

<p>
<q>The purest Ultramontanism!</q> cried Miüsov impatiently, crossing
and recrossing his legs.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, well, we have no mountains,</q> cried Father Iosif, and turning
to the elder he continued: <q>Observe the answer he makes to the
following <q>fundamental and essential</q> propositions of his opponent,
who is, you must note, an ecclesiastic. First, that <q>no social organization
can or ought to arrogate to itself power to dispose of the
civic and political rights of its members.</q> Secondly, that <q>criminal
and civil jurisdiction ought not to belong to the Church, and is
inconsistent with its nature, both as a divine institution and as an
organization of men for religious objects,</q> and, finally, in the third
place, <q>the Church is a kingdom not of this world.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>

<p>
<q>A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!</q> Father
Païssy could not refrain from breaking in again. <q>I have read the
book which you have answered,</q> he added, addressing Ivan, <q>and
was astounded at the words <q>the Church is a kingdom not of this
world.</q> If it is not of this world, then it cannot exist on earth at
all. In the Gospel, the words <q>not of this world</q> are not used in that
sense. To play with such words is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus
Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. The Kingdom of
Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is
only entered through the Church which has been founded and
established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in
such a connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in
truth, a kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly
become the kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that
we have the divine promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After
listening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the
elder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:
</p>

<p>
<q>The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the
first three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church
and was nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire
desired to become Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming
Christian, it included the Church but remained a pagan State
in very many of its departments. In reality this was bound to
happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of the pagan
civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects and
fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering
into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental
principles&mdash;the rock on which it stands&mdash;and could pursue
no other aims than those which have been ordained and revealed
by God Himself, and among them that of drawing the whole world,
and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the Church. In
that way (that is, with a view to the future) it is not the Church
that should seek a definite position in the State, like <q>every social
organization,</q> or as <q>an organization of men for religious purposes</q>
(as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the contrary, every
earthly State should be, in the end, completely transformed into the
Church and should become nothing else but a Church, rejecting
<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>
every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this
will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory
as a great State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it
from a false, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful
path, which alone leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author
of the book <hi rend='italic'>On the Foundations of Church Jurisdiction</hi> would have
judged correctly if, in seeking and laying down those foundations,
he had looked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in
our sinful and imperfect days. But as soon as the author ventures
to declare that the foundations which he predicates now, part of
which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the permanent, essential,
and eternal foundations, he is going directly against the Church
and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist of my article.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is, in brief,</q> Father Païssy began again, laying stress on each
word, <q>according to certain theories only too clearly formulated
in the nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into
the State, as though this would be an advance from a lower to a
higher form, so as to disappear into it, making way for science, for
the spirit of the age, and civilization. And if the Church resists
and is unwilling, some corner will be set apart for her in the State,
and even that under control&mdash;and this will be so everywhere in all
modern European countries. But Russian hopes and conceptions
demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower into a
higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State should
end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else.
So be it! So be it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I confess you've reassured me somewhat,</q> Miüsov said
smiling, again crossing his legs. <q>So far as I understand, then, the
realization of such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming
of Christ. That's as you please. It's a beautiful Utopian dream
of the abolition of war, diplomacy, banks, and so on&mdash;something
after the fashion of socialism, indeed. But I imagined that it was
all meant seriously, and that the Church might be <emph>now</emph> going to try
criminals, and sentence them to beating, prison, and even death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church
would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death.
Crime and the way of regarding it would inevitably change, not all
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
at once of course, but fairly soon,</q> Ivan replied calmly, without
flinching.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you serious?</q> Miüsov glanced keenly at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all
the criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,</q>
Ivan went on. <q>I ask you, what would become of the excluded?
He would be cut off then not only from men, as now, but from
Christ. By his crime he would have transgressed not only against
men but against the Church of Christ. This is so even now, of
course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly enunciated, and very,
very often the criminal of to-day compromises with his conscience:
<q>I steal,</q> he says, <q>but I don't go against the Church. I'm not an
enemy of Christ.</q> That's what the criminal of to-day is continually
saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the State
it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over the
world, to say: <q>All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are
the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian
Church.</q> It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it
requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on
the other side, take the Church's own view of crime: is it not bound
to renounce the present almost pagan attitude, and to change from
a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation
of society, as at present, into completely and honestly adopting the
idea of the regeneration of the man, of his reformation and salvation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? I fail to understand again,</q> Miüsov interrupted.
<q>Some sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even
incomprehensible. What is excommunication? What sort of exclusion?
I suspect you are simply amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,</q> said the elder suddenly,
and all turned to him at once. <q>If it were not for the
Church of Christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal
from evil-doing, no real chastisement for it afterwards; none, that
is, but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now, which in the
majority of cases only embitters the heart; and not the real punishment,
the only effectual one, the only deterrent and softening one,
which lies in the recognition of sin by conscience.</q>
</p>

<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>

<p>
<q>How is that, may one inquire?</q> asked Miüsov, with lively
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why,</q> began the elder, <q>all these sentences to exile with hard
labor, and formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what's
more, deter hardly a single criminal, and the number of crimes
does not diminish but is continually on the increase. You must
admit that. Consequently the security of society is not preserved,
for, although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and
sent far away out of sight, another criminal always comes to take
his place at once, and often two of them. If anything does preserve
society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform
the criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience.
It is only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christian
society&mdash;that is, of the Church&mdash;that he recognizes his sin against
society&mdash;that is, against the Church. So that it is only against
the Church, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day
can recognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,
then it would know when to bring back from exclusion
and to reunite to itself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction,
but only the power of moral condemnation, withdraws of her
own accord from punishing the criminal actively. She does not
excommunicate him but simply persists in motherly exhortation of
him. What is more, the Church even tries to preserve all Christian
communion with the criminal. She admits him to church services,
to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats him more as a
captive than as a convict. And what would become of the criminal,
O Lord, if even the Christian society&mdash;that is, the Church&mdash;were to
reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off?
What would become of him if the Church punished him with her
excommunication as the direct consequence of the secular law?
There could be no more terrible despair, at least for a Russian
criminal, for Russian criminals still have faith. Though, who
knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen, perhaps the
despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what
would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving
mother, holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner
is too severely punished already by the civil law, and there must
be at least some one to have pity on him. The Church holds aloof,
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
above all, because its judgment is the only one that contains the
truth, and therefore cannot practically and morally be united to any
other judgment even as a temporary compromise. She can enter
into no compact about that. The foreign criminal, they say, rarely
repents, for the very doctrines of to-day confirm him in the idea
that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly
oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a force that
triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of themselves
in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness,
and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate
of the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without the
compassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there
are no churches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid
church buildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago
striven to pass from Church into State and to disappear in it completely.
So it seems at least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome,
it was proclaimed a State instead of a Church a thousand years ago.
And so the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member of
the Church and sinks into despair. If he returns to society, often
it is with such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him off.
You can judge for yourself how it must end. In many cases it
would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is that besides
the established law courts we have the Church too, which always
keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son.
And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought, the
judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice
is still living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively
recognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said
here just now is true too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the
Church were introduced in practice in its full force, that is, if the
whole of the society were changed into the Church, not only the
judgment of the Church would have influence on the reformation
of the criminal such as it never has now, but possibly also the crimes
themselves would be incredibly diminished. And there can be no
doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the crime
of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed
in restoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in
regenerating the fallen. It is true,</q> said Father Zossima, with a
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
smile, <q>the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting
on some seven righteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will
continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation
from a society almost heathen in character into a single universal
and all-powerful Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at
the end of the ages, for it is ordained to come to pass! And there
is no need to be troubled about times and seasons, for the secret
of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of God, in His foresight,
and His love. And what in human reckoning seems still afar off,
may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve of its
appearance. And so be it, so be it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So be it, so be it!</q> Father Païssy repeated austerely and reverently.
</p>

<p>
<q>Strange, extremely strange!</q> Miüsov pronounced, not so much
with heat as with latent indignation.
</p>

<p>
<q>What strikes you as so strange?</q> Father Iosif inquired cautiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's beyond anything!</q> cried Miüsov, suddenly breaking
out; <q>the State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position
of the State. It's not simply Ultramontanism, it's arch-Ultramontanism!
It's beyond the dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are completely misunderstanding it,</q> said Father Païssy
sternly. <q>Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the
State. That is Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation
of the devil. On the contrary, the State is transformed into the
Church, will ascend and become a Church over the whole world&mdash;which
is the complete opposite of Ultramontanism and Rome, and
your interpretation, and is only the glorious destiny ordained for the
Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the east!</q>
</p>

<p>
Miüsov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinary
personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending
smile played on his lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing
heart. The whole conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced
casually at Rakitin, who was standing immovable in his place by
the door listening and watching intently though with downcast
eyes. But from the color in his cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin
was probably no less excited, and he knew what caused his excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,</q> Miüsov
said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. <q>Some years ago,
<pb n='068'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>
soon after the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>coup d'état</foreign>
of December, I happened to be calling
in Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government,
and I met a very interesting man in his house. This individual
was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a
whole regiment of political detectives&mdash;a rather powerful position
in its own way. I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity
of conversation with him. And as he had not come as a
visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report, and as
he saw the reception given me by his chief, he deigned to speak
with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course. He was
rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,
especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The
subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted.
I will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this
person. <q>We are not particularly afraid,</q> said he, <q>of all these socialists,
anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them
and know all their goings on. But there are a few peculiar men
among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at the same
time are socialists. These are the people we are most afraid of.
They are dreadful people! The socialist who is a Christian is more
to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.</q> The words struck
me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to me here,
gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?</q> Father
Païssy asked directly, without beating about the bush.
</p>

<p>
But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer,
the door opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
came in. They had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his
sudden appearance caused some surprise for a moment.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?</head>

<p>
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty,
of medium height and agreeable countenance, looked older
than his years. He was muscular, and showed signs of considerable
<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>
physical strength. Yet there was something not healthy in his face.
It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy
sallowness in their color. His rather large, prominent, dark
eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet there was a
vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking
irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed
something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing.
<q>It's hard to tell what he's thinking,</q> those who talked to him
sometimes declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen
in his eyes were startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness
to mirthful and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his
eyes were so gloomy. A certain strained look in his face was easy
to understand at this moment. Every one knew, or had heard of,
the extremely restless and dissipated life which he had been leading
of late, as well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused
in his quarrels with his father. There were several stories current
in the town about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature, <q>of
an unstable and unbalanced mind,</q> as our justice of the peace,
Katchalnikov, happily described him.
</p>

<p>
He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned
frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat.
Having only lately left the army, he still had mustaches and no
beard. His dark brown hair was cropped short, and combed forward
on his temples. He had the long, determined stride of a
military man. He stood still for a moment on the threshold, and
glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder, guessing
him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked his blessing.
Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed
his hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so
long, but Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to
my inquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one.
Now I suddenly learn&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't disturb yourself,</q> interposed the elder. <q>No matter. You
are a little late. It's of no consequence....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your
goodness.</q>
</p>

<pb n='070'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>

<p>
Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly
towards his father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful
bow. He had evidently considered it beforehand, and made this
bow in all seriousness, thinking it his duty to show his respect and
good intentions.
</p>

<p>
Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal
to the occasion. In response to Dmitri's bow he jumped up from his
chair and made his son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly
solemn and impressive, which gave him a positively malignant
look. Dmitri bowed generally to all present, and without a word
walked to the window with his long, resolute stride, sat down on the
only empty chair, near Father Païssy, and, bending forward, prepared
to listen to the conversation he had interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri's entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the
conversation was resumed. But this time Miüsov thought it unnecessary
to reply to Father Païssy's persistent and almost irritable
question.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,</q> he observed with
a certain well-bred nonchalance. <q>It's a subtle question, too. Here
Ivan Fyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting
to say about that also. Ask him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing special, except one little remark,</q> Ivan replied at once.
<q>European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often
mix up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity.
This wild notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it's not
only Liberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity,
but, in many cases, it appears, the police&mdash;the foreign police, of
course&mdash;do the same. Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,</q> Miüsov
repeated. <q>I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting
and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself.
Only five days ago, in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he
solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole
world to make men love their neighbors. That there was no law
of nature that man should love mankind, and that, if there had
been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing to a natural law,
but simply because men have believed in immortality. Ivan Fyodorovitch
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that
faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality,
not only love but every living force maintaining the
life of the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing
then would be immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism.
That's not all. He ended by asserting that for every individual,
like ourselves, who does not believe in God or immortality,
the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact
contrary of the former religious law, and that egoism, even to crime,
must become not only lawful but even recognized as the inevitable,
the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position. From
this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric
and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch's theories.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me,</q> Dmitri cried suddenly; <q>if I've heard aright, crime
must not only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable
and the most rational outcome of his position for every infidel!
Is that so or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so,</q> said Father Païssy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll remember it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly
as he had begun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the
disappearance of the faith in immortality?</q> the elder asked Ivan
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is
no immortality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why unhappy?</q> Ivan asked smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because, in all probability you don't believe yourself in the immortality
of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in
your article on Church jurisdiction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn't altogether joking,</q>
Ivan suddenly and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You were not altogether joking. That's true. The question
is still fretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes
sometimes to divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it
by despair itself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself
with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
don't believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock
at them inwardly.... That question you have not answered, and
it is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?</q>
Ivan went on asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the
same inexplicable smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>If it can't be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided
in the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your
heart, and all its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who
has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking
and seeking higher things, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God
grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth, and may God
bless your path.</q>
</p>

<p>
The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the
cross over Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his
seat, went up to him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand
went back to his place in silence. His face looked firm and earnest.
This action and all the preceding conversation, which was so surprising
from Ivan, impressed every one by its strangeness and a certain
solemnity, so that all were silent for a moment, and there was a
look almost of apprehension in Alyosha's face. But Miüsov suddenly
shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment Fyodor
Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most pious and holy elder,</q> he cried, pointing to Ivan, <q>that is
my son, flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most
dutiful Karl Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in,
Dmitri, against whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful
Franz Moor&mdash;they are both out of Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Robbers</hi>, and so
I am the reigning Count von Moor! Judge and save us! We need not
only your prayers but your prophecies!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak without buffoonery, and don't begin by insulting the
members of your family,</q> answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted
voice. He was obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his
strength was failing.
</p>

<p>
<q>An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!</q> cried
Dmitri indignantly. He too leapt up. <q>Forgive it, reverend
Father,</q> he added, addressing the elder. <q>I am not a cultivated
man, and I don't even know how to address you properly, but you
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
have been deceived and you have been too good-natured in letting
us meet here. All my father wants is a scandal. Why he wants it
only he can tell. He always has some motive. But I believe I
know why&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They all blame me, all of them!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his
turn. <q>Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been
blaming me, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you have!</q> he turned suddenly
to Miüsov, although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting
him. <q>They all accuse me of having hidden the children's money
in my boots, and cheated them, but isn't there a court of law?
There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, from
your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money
you had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left.
Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri
is not a stranger to him. Because they are all against me, while
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to me, and not a little, but some
thousands of which I have documentary proof. The whole town is
echoing with his debaucheries. And where he was stationed before,
he several times spent a thousand or two for the seduction of some
respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in its
most secret details. I'll prove it.... Would you believe it, holy
Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorable of young
ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,
formerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and
had the Anna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by
his promise of marriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed
to him, yet before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on
a certain enchantress. And although this enchantress has lived in,
so to speak, civil marriage with a respectable man, yet she is of an
independent character, an unapproachable fortress for everybody,
just like a legal wife&mdash;for she is virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is
virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to open this fortress with a
golden key, and that's why he is insolent to me now, trying to get
money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress
already. He's continually borrowing money for the purpose. From
whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be silent!</q> cried Dmitri, <q>wait till I'm gone. Don't dare in my
presence to asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you
<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
should utter a word about her is an outrage, and I won't permit it!</q>
</p>

<p>
He was breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya! Mitya!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing
out a tear. <q>And is your father's blessing nothing to you? If
I curse you, what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shameless hypocrite!</q> exclaimed Dmitri furiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with
others? Gentlemen, only fancy; there's a poor but honorable man
living here, burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got
into trouble and was discharged from the army, but not publicly,
not by court-martial, with no slur on his honor. And three weeks
ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in a tavern, dragged him out
into the street and beat him publicly, and all because he is an agent
in a little business of mine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all a lie! Outwardly it's the truth, but inwardly a lie!</q>
Dmitri was trembling with rage. <q>Father, I don't justify my action.
Yes, I confess it publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and
I regret it now, and I'm disgusted with myself for my brutal rage.
But this captain, this agent of yours, went to that lady whom you
call an enchantress, and suggested to her from you, that she should
take I.O.U.'s of mine which were in your possession, and should sue
me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of them, if
I persisted in claiming an account from you of my property. Now
you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you
yourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face....
She told me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to
put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her, because
you'd begun to force your attentions upon her; and I know all
about that, too; she laughed at you for that as well&mdash;you hear&mdash;she
laughed at you as she described it. So here you have this man, this
father who reproaches his profligate son! Gentlemen, forgive my
anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you
together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if he held
out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has just
this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady,
for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in
vain, I have made up my mind to show up his game, though he is
my father....</q>
</p>

<pb n='075'/><anchor id='Pg075'/>

<p>
He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed
with difficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except
Father Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked
austere but waited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale,
not from excitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring
smile lighted up his face; from time to time he raised his
hand, as though to check the storm, and, of course, a gesture from
him would have been enough to end the scene; but he seemed to be
waiting for something and watched them intently as though trying
to make out something which was not perfectly clear to him. At
last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,</q> he said hotly.
<q>But I did not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom
I had to deal. This must be stopped at once! Believe me, your
reverence, I had no precise knowledge of the details that have just
come to light, I was unwilling to believe them, and I learn for the
first time.... A father is jealous of his son's relations with a
woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the creature to get his
son into prison! This is the company in which I have been forced
to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was as
much deceived as any one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in
an unnatural voice, <q>if you were not my son I would challenge you
this instant to a duel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a
handkerchief,</q> he ended, stamping with both feet.
</p>

<p>
With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments
when they enter so completely into their part that they
tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest, although at that very
moment, or a second later, they are able to whisper to themselves,
<q>You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner! You're acting
now, in spite of your <q>holy</q> wrath.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt
at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought ... I thought,</q> he said, in a soft and, as it were,
controlled voice, <q>that I was coming to my native place with the
angel of my heart, my betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find
nothing but a depraved profligate, a despicable clown!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A duel!</q> yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering
<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>
at each syllable. <q>And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, let me
tell you that there has never been in all your family a loftier, and
more honest&mdash;you hear&mdash;more honest woman than this <q>creature,</q>
as you have dared to call her! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have
abandoned your betrothed for that <q>creature,</q> so you must yourself
have thought that your betrothed couldn't hold a candle to her.
That's the woman called a <q>creature</q>!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shameful!</q> broke from Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shameful and disgraceful!</q> Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in
a boyish voice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till
that moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is such a man alive?</q> Dmitri, beside himself with rage,
growled in a hollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked
almost deformed. <q>Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling
the earth?</q> He looked round at every one and pointed at the old
man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
rushing up to Father Iosif. <q>That's the answer to your <q>shameful!</q>
What is shameful? That <q>creature,</q> that <q>woman of loose behavior</q>
is perhaps holier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking
salvation! She fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment.
But she loved much, and Christ himself forgave the woman
<q>who loved much.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not for such love Christ forgave her,</q> broke impatiently
from the gentle Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here,
eating cabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon
a day, and you think you bribe God with gudgeon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is unendurable!</q> was heard on all sides in the cell.
</p>

<p>
But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way.
Father Zossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with
anxiety for the elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however,
in supporting him by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards
Dmitri and reaching him sank on his knees before him. Alyosha
thought that he had fallen from weakness, but this was not so. The
elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's feet till
his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so astounded that he
<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>
failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a faint smile
on his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!</q> he said, bowing on all sides
to his guests.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down
to him&mdash;what did it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, <q>Oh, God!</q>
hid his face in his hands, and rushed out of the room. All the
guests flocked out after him, in their confusion not saying good-by,
or bowing to their host. Only the monks went up to him again
for a blessing.
</p>

<p>
<q>What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic
or what?</q> said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to
reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular.
They were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage
at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen,</q> Miüsov answered
at once ill-humoredly, <q>but I will spare myself your company,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where's that
monk?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That monk,</q> that is, the monk who had invited them to dine
with the Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as
soon as they came down the steps from the elder's cell, as though
he had been waiting for them all the time.
</p>

<p>
<q>Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest
respect to the Father Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miüsov,
to his reverence, telling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen
circumstances I am unable to have the honor of being
present at his table, greatly as I should desire to do so,</q> Miüsov
said irritably to the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,</q> Fyodor
Pavlovitch cut in immediately. <q>Do you hear, Father; this gentleman
doesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at
once. And you shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the
Father Superior and good appetite to you. I will decline, and not
you. Home, home, I'll eat at home, I don't feel equal to it here,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable relative.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible
man!</q>
</p>

<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>

<p>
<q>I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim
the relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your
shuffling. I'll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan,
stay if you like. I'll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires
you to go to the Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to
apologize for the disturbance we've been making....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it true that you are going home? Aren't you lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what's happened!
Forgive me, gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset
besides! And, indeed, I am ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has
the heart of Alexander of Macedon and another the heart of the
little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dog Fido. I am ashamed!
After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, to gobble up the
monastery's sauces? I am ashamed, I can't. You must excuse
me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?</q> thought Miüsov,
still hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful
eyes. The latter turned round, and noticing that Miüsov was
watching him, waved him a kiss.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, are you coming to the Superior?</q> Miüsov asked Ivan
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded
dinner,</q> said Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the
fact that the monk was listening. <q>We ought, at least, to apologize
for the disturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What
do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father
won't be there,</q> observed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!</q>
</p>

<p>
They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On
the road through the copse he made one observation however&mdash;that
the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they
were more than half an hour late. He received no answer. Miüsov
looked with hatred at Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,</q>
he thought. <q>A brazen face, and the conscience of a
Karamazov!</q>

<head>Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career</head>

<p>
Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated
him on his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare
necessities. There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt
for a mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk
with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted
on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked
intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste,
you are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me stay here,</q> Alyosha entreated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will
wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And
remember, my son</q>&mdash;the elder liked to call him that&mdash;<q>this is not the
place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call me, leave
the monastery. Go away for good.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha started.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you
for great service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage.
And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear <emph>all</emph>
before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don't
doubt of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you. Do not
abandon Him and He will not abandon you. You will see great
sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is my last
message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.
Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not
only my days but my hours are numbered.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his
mouth quivered.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it again?</q> Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. <q>The
worldly may follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the
father who is departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me,
I must pray. Go, and make haste. Be near your brothers. And
not near one only, but near both.</q>
</p>

<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>

<p>
Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make
no protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed,
moreover, to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question
was on the tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He
knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had
thought fit. But evidently it was not his will. That action had
made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed blindly in its
mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.
</p>

<p>
As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the
monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt a
sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear
again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his approaching end. What
he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha
believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him?
How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should
he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery.
Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish.
He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the
hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed
at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go&mdash;about
five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but
at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin. He was waiting
for some one.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you waiting for me?</q> asked Alyosha, overtaking him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> grinned Rakitin. <q>You are hurrying to the Father Superior,
I know; he has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet
since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you
remember? I shan't be there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell
me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That's what I
want to ask you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What vision?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he tap the
ground with his forehead, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak of Father Zossima?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of Father Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tapped the ground?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what
does that vision mean?</q>
</p>

<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>

<p>
<q>I don't know what it means, Misha.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I knew he wouldn't explain it to you! There's nothing wonderful
about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there
was an object in the performance. All the pious people in the town
will talk about it and spread the story through the province, wondering
what it meant. To my thinking the old man really has a
keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your house stinks of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What crime?</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.
</p>

<p>
<q>It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and
your rich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready
for what may turn up. If something happens later on, it'll be:
<q>Ah, the holy man foresaw it, prophesied it!</q> though it's a poor sort
of prophecy, flopping like that. <q>Ah, but it was symbolic,</q> they'll
say, <q>an allegory,</q> and the devil knows what all! It'll be remembered
to his glory: <q>He predicted the crime and marked the criminal!</q>
That's always the way with these crazy fanatics; they cross
themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like
your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a
murderer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've
thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen,
Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between
two stools. Have you thought of it or not? Answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was
taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? Have you really?</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... I've not exactly thought it,</q> muttered Alyosha, <q>but
directly you began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought
of it myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your
father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime.
Then I'm not mistaken?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But wait, wait a minute,</q> Alyosha broke in uneasily. <q>What
has led you to see all this? Why does it interest you? That's the
first question.</q>
</p>

<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>

<p>
<q>Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them
separately. What led me to see it? I shouldn't have seen it, if I
hadn't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the
very heart of him all at once. I caught the whole man from one
trait. These very honest but passionate people have a line which
mustn't be crossed. If it were, he'd run at your father with a
knife. But your father's a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who
can never draw the line&mdash;if they both let themselves go, they'll
both come to grief.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't
come to that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest,
our Mitya (he is stupid, but honest), but he's&mdash;a sensualist. That's
the very definition and inner essence of him. It's your father has
handed him on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder
at you, Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a
Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to
a disease. But now, these three sensualists are watching one another,
with their knives in their belts. The three of them are
knocking their heads together, and you may be the fourth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri&mdash;despises her,</q>
said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has
openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her.
There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand
yet. A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's
body, or even with a part of a woman's body (a sensualist can understand
that), and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his
father and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he's honest,
he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive.
Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in his verse.
Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at their feet
without a thrill&mdash;and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no help
here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he
can't tear himself away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand that,</q> Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it
out at the first word,</q> said Rakitin, malignantly. <q>That escaped
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a
familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about sensuality,
I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're
a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you've thought
about, and what you know already! You are pure, but you've been
down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long time.
You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov&mdash;no
doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a
sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why
do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has
been begging me to bring you along. <q>I'll pull off his cassock,</q> she
says. You can't think how she keeps begging me to bring you. I
wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know,
she's an extraordinary woman, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank her and say I'm not coming,</q> said Alyosha, with a
strained smile. <q>Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you
my idea after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune,
brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you
Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your
brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown
motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits it's
a fraud himself&mdash;that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get
Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And
what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender
his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka.
And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness.
Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on
with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing
in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka.
His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her account
he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Miüsov
called her an <q>abandoned creature.</q> He's worse than a tom-cat in
love. At first she was only employed by him in connection with
his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly
realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And
they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path!
But Grushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them,
and teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of.
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't
marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his
purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes in; he has no money,
but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to marry her! to abandon
his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and
the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been
the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated,
provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well
come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is
waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry
off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her
dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a
man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't
be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know
as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy
girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of
his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man
who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between
the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so
that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying
himself at your expense.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?</q>
Alyosha asked sharply, frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows
that you know I'm speaking the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only
the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for
thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps
it's suffering he is seeking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What wild dream now? Oh, you&mdash;aristocrats!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage.
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who
don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's phrases.
Ah, Ivan has set you a problem!</q> cried Rakitin, with undisguised
malice. His face changed, and his lips twitched. <q>And the problem's
a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains&mdash;you'll
understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous. And did
you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of
the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful. (And
by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out:
<q>I will remember!</q>) An attractive theory for scoundrels!&mdash;(I'm
being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>poseurs</foreign>, <q>haunted by profound,
unsolved doubts.</q> He's showing off,
and what it all comes to is, <q>on the one hand we cannot but admit</q>
and <q>on the other it must be confessed!</q> His whole theory is a
fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue
even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love for
freedom, for equality, for fraternity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
though remembering something, he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that's enough,</q> he said, with a still more crooked smile.
<q>Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are
clever but ... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your
getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you
are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that
for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan.
Are you jealous of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother
Ivan with you. Don't you understand that one might very well
dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil
should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why
haven't I a right to abuse him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad.
He doesn't speak of you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna's
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
he was abusing me for all he was worth&mdash;you see what an interest
he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous one
after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express the
opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an archimandrite in
the immediate future and don't become a monk, I shall be sure to
go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer,
that I shall write for the next ten years, and in the end become the
owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic
side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping
a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in with both sides
and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's account,
the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the proceeds
and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the end
of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing
offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the
Neva, which they say is to be built in Petersburg.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of
it,</q> cried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different
in my mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You
can't have been at Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking
about you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him
tell it with my own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me, but
I overheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in
Grushenka's bedroom and I couldn't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch
was in the next room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!</q> cried Rakitin,
turning crimson. <q>Are you mad? You're out of your mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being
an ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about
playing the buffoon at other men's tables, and was only admitted to
the kitchen as a favor. I may be only a priest's son, and dirt in
the eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I
couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you
to understand that!</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin was intensely irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ...
how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?</q>
Alyosha flushed suddenly. <q>I tell you again, I heard that she was a
relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself
you're not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people
had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your
business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father,
is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are.
You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it?
Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the
Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have.
Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've
broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's
shouting out something after them from the steps. And your
father's shouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing.
Bah, and there goes Miüsov driving away in his carriage. You see,
he's going. And there's old Maximov running!&mdash;there must have
been a row. There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not
been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been
beaten? It would serve them right!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a
scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse
of a moment.
</p>

<head>Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene</head>

<p>
Miüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but
feel some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's
with Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt
that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's
cell, and so to have forgotten himself. <q>The monks were not to
blame, in any case,</q> he reflected, on the steps. <q>And if they're
decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't
argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
them that I've nothing to do with that Æsop,
that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this
affair, just as they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and
relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once.
He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become
much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the
wood and river in question were.
</p>

<p>
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the
Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not
a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether;
they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than
Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing
of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered
with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not
even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there
were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous
thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully
decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were
three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent
mead, and a large glass jug of kvas&mdash;both the latter made in
the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no
vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup
made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish
served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote,
and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these
good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where
he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got
information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious
temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and
nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would
play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable,
and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the
contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table
he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any
one else could have influenced him in that.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be
invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and one
other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They
were already waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The
Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his
guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black
hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed
to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive
his blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and
Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted
and complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.
</p>

<p>
<q>We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,</q> began Miüsov,
simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.
<q>Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor
of your hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father
Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with
his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ...
in fact, quite unseemly ... as</q>&mdash;he glanced at the monks&mdash;<q>your
reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognizing
that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and
begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
place.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miüsov completely recovered
his self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation
disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
</p>

<p>
The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a
slight bend of the head, replied:
</p>

<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>

<p>
<q>I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might
have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud.
All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before
him, with peculiar fervor.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last
prank. It must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and
really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father
Superior as though nothing had happened, after his disgraceful behavior
in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed
of himself&mdash;quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would
be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly
been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it,
when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own words
at the elder's: <q>I always feel when I meet people that I am lower
than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play
the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than
I.</q> He longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness.
He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been
asked, <q>Why do you hate so and so, so much?</q> And he had answered
them, with his shameless impudence, <q>I'll tell you. He has
done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since
I have hated him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating
for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively
quivered. <q>Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,</q> he
decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed
in the following words, <q>Well, there is no rehabilitating
myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will
show them I don't care what they think&mdash;that's all!</q>
</p>

<p>
He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned
to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no
clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control
himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of
obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for
which he could be legally punished. In the last resort, he could
always restrain himself, and had marveled indeed at himself, on that
score, sometimes. He appeared in the Father Superior's dining-room,
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving
to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company,
and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
them all boldly in the face. <q>They thought I had gone, and here
I am again,</q> he cried to the whole room.
</p>

<p>
For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at
once every one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively
scandalous, was about to happen. Miüsov passed immediately from
the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the
feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No! this I cannot endure!</q> he cried. <q>I absolutely cannot! and ...
I certainly cannot!</q>
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he
was beyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.
</p>
