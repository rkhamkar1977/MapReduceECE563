<p>
<q>You&mdash;can see spirits?</q> the monk inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming
out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the
door, and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick
long gray tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door
and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He
squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over
him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed spider.
He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking, but they
don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have been there.
I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,</q> said
the monk, growing bolder and bolder, <q>is it true, as they noise
abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual
communication with the Holy Ghost?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He does fly down at times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he fly down? In what form?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As a bird.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's the Holy Ghost and there's the Holy Spirit. The Holy
Spirit can appear as other birds&mdash;sometimes as a swallow, sometimes
a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue-tit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know him from an ordinary tit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he speak, in what language?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Human language.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what does he tell you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would
ask me unseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.</q>
</p>

<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>

<p>
<q>Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,</q> the
monk shook his head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened
little eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you see this tree?</q> asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do, blessed Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What sort of shape?</q> inquired the monk, after a pause of vain
expectation.
</p>

<p>
<q>It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night
it is Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those
arms, I see it clearly and tremble. It's terrible, terrible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, He'll snatch me up and carry me away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alive?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard? He will
take me in His arms and bear me away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one
of the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished
at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father
Zossima. He was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not
strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should
<q>see marvels.</q> His words seemed certainly queer, but God only
could tell what was hidden in those words, and were not worse
words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their
intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the devil's tail
he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the figurative
sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong
prejudice against the institution of <q>elders,</q> which he only knew
of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before
he had been long at the monastery, he had detected the
secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the
institution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who
poked his nose into everything. This was why the news of the
fresh <q>miracle</q> performed by Father Zossima reduced him to
extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their
inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting
to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions
among the monks that were crowding within and without the
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
elder's cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at the time,
and only recollected it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima,
feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of
Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran
at once. There was no one else in the cell but Father Païssy, Father
Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The elder, opening his weary eyes
and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Are your people expecting you, my son?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise some one yesterday
to see them to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did promise&mdash;to my father&mdash;my brothers&mdash;others too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die
without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say
that word, my son, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear
son, because you love me. But now go to keep your promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the
promise that he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be
the last gift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his
soul. He made haste that he might finish what he had to do in
the town and return quickly. Father Païssy, too, uttered some
words of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly. He
spoke as they left the cell together.
</p>

<p>
<q>Remember, young man, unceasingly,</q> Father Païssy began,
without preface, <q>that the science of this world, which has become
a great power, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything
divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel
analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was
sacred of old. But they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked
the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole
still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it
not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the
masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the souls
of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who
have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being
still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal
of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When
it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque. Remember
this especially, young man, since you are being sent into the
world by your departing elder. Maybe, remembering this great
day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the heart for your
guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the world
are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my
orphan.</q>
</p>

<p>
With these words Father Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the
monastery and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he
had met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in
this austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as
though Father Zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and
<q>perhaps that's just what had passed between them,</q> Alyosha
thought suddenly. The philosophic reflections he had just heard
so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Païssy's heart.
He was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation
and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest
defense he could imagine.

<head>Chapter II. At His Father's</head>

<p>
First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered
that his father had insisted the day before that he
should come without his brother Ivan seeing him. <q>Why so?</q> Alyosha
wondered suddenly. <q>Even if my father has something to say
to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his excitement
yesterday he meant to say something different,</q> he decided.
Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden
gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),
told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone
out two hours ago.
</p>

<p>
<q>And my father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is up, taking his coffee,</q> Marfa answered somewhat dryly.
</p>

<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>

<p>
Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table
wearing slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself
by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however.
He was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out
marketing. Though he had got up early and was trying to put a
bold face on it, he looked tired and weak. His forehead, upon which
huge purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged
with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen terribly in the
night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his
whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old man
was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he
came in.
</p>

<p>
<q>The coffee is cold,</q> he cried harshly; <q>I won't offer you any.
I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't
invite any one to share it. Why have you come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To find out how you are,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence.
You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking
in directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he
got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the
fortieth time that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his
red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,</q> he observed
sententiously. <q>Well, how are things over there? How is
your elder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is very bad; he may die to-day,</q> answered Alyosha. But
his father had not listened, and had forgotten his own question
at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's gone out,</q> he said suddenly. <q>He is doing his utmost
to carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,</q>
he added maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely he did not tell you so?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three
weeks ago? You don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you?
He must have had some object in coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? Why do you say such things?</q> said Alyosha,
troubled.
</p>

<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>

<p>
<q>He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a farthing
from me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well
know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing,
and the longer I live, the more I shall need it,</q> he continued, pacing
from one corner of the room to the other, keeping his hands in the
pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material.
<q>I can still pass for a man at five and fifty, but I want to pass for
one for another twenty years. As I get older, you know, I shan't be
a pretty object. The wenches won't come to me of their own accord,
so I shall want my money. So I am saving up more and more,
simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may as
well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell
you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others
do it on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall
upon me for being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it's not the
proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I
believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all.
You can pray for my soul if you like. And if you don't want to,
don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan talked well here
yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a conceited coxcomb,
but he has no particular learning ... nor education either. He
sits silent and smiles at one without speaking&mdash;that's what pulls him
through.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened to him in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself
airs. Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a
minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
you have only to want a thing and you can have it. That's what
Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to prevent me getting married
and that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself.
He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I should
leave him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries
Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what
he's reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better
lie down,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>There! you say that,</q> the old man observed suddenly, as though
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
it had struck him for the first time, <q>and I am not angry with you.
But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you
I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not ill-natured, but distorted,</q> said Alyosha with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked
up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course
in these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a
prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your
old father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own
house, and brag of murdering him outright&mdash;all in the presence of
witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked
up at once for what he did yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you don't mean to take proceedings?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's
another thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to see
him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old
man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to
me.... For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know
her through and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy?
Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy
into it, it's delicious, my boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may,</q> said
Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket
of his cassock. <q>And you'd better not have brandy, either,</q> he
suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing
them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.</q>
</p>

<p>
He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then
locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough. One glass won't kill me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see you are in a better humor now,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels
I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya&mdash;why is that?
He wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
are all scoundrels! But I don't recognize Ivan, I don't know him
at all. Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As
though I'd leave him anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may
as well know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles
at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on
them. And your Mitya will squelch too. <emph>Your</emph> Mitya, for you love
him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him.
But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving
him. But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like
Ivan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust.
When the wind blows, the dust will be gone.... I had a silly idea
in my head when I told you to come to-day; I wanted to find out
from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a thousand or
maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself
off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without
Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I&mdash;I'll ask him,</q> muttered Alyosha. <q>If you would give him
three thousand, perhaps he&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've
changed my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give
him anything, not a penny, I want my money myself,</q> cried the old
man, waving his hand. <q>I'll crush him like a beetle without it.
Don't say anything to him or else he will begin hoping. There's
nothing for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is that betrothed of
his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully hidden from
me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see her
yesterday, I believe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing will induce her to abandon him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and
a scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young
ladies, very different from&mdash;Ah, if I had his youth and the looks
I had then (for I was better-looking than he at eight and twenty)
I'd have been a conquering hero just as he is. He is a low cad!
But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he shan't! I'll crush him!</q>
</p>

<p>
His anger had returned with the last words.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,</q> he
snapped harshly.
</p>

<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>

<p>
Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that for?</q> The old man was a little surprised. <q>We
shall see each other again, or do you think we shan't?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all, I didn't mean anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nor did I, I did not mean anything,</q> said the old man, looking
at him. <q>Listen, listen,</q> he shouted after him, <q>make haste and
come again and I'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like
to-day. Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!</q>
</p>

<p>
And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the
cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have more!</q> he muttered, clearing his throat, and again
he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he
went into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one
minute he was asleep.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys</head>

<p>
<q>Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,</q>
thought Alyosha, as he left his father's house and turned
towards Madame Hohlakov's, <q>or I might have to tell him of my
meeting with Grushenka yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had
renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again.
<q>Father is spiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick
to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday,
he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made
some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to-day, whatever
happens.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on
the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a
great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and
turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is
divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between
the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home
from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with
leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in
little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round
the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear.
The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently
holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been
able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although
he was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he liked
schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious as he was to-day,
he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He looked into
their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had
stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,
there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a
satchel at his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking
and with sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and
anxious watch on the other six, obviously his schoolfellows with
whom he had just come out of school, but with whom he had evidently
had a feud.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy
in a black jacket, observed:
</p>

<p>
<q>When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry
it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got
yours on your right side. So it will be awkward for you to get
at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical
remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get
at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more with a
group of children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way
so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it
by instinct.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he is left-handed,</q> another, a fine healthy-looking boy of
eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>He even throws stones with his left hand,</q> observed a third.
</p>

<p>
At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed
the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by
the boy standing the other side of the ditch.
</p>

<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>

<p>
<q>Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,</q> they all shouted. But
Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged
himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the
ground. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose
coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the
group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully
on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov,
Karamazov!</q> the boys shouted, laughing. <q>Come, all throw at him
at once!</q> and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the
head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously
returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many
of the group had their pockets full too.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one!
Why, you'll kill him,</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary
boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>He began first!</q> cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish
voice. <q>He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day
with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he
must be thrashed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what for? I suppose you tease him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,</q> cried
the children. <q>It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all
of you, at him again, don't miss, Smurov!</q> and again a fire of stones,
and a very vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch
was hit in the chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill
towards Mihailovsky Street. They all shouted: <q>Aha, he is funking,
he is running away. Wisp of tow!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too
good for him,</q> said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He
seemed to be the eldest.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's wrong with him?</q> asked Alyosha, <q>is he a tell-tale or
what?</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?</q> the same boy went
on. <q>Catch him up.... You see he's stopped again, he is waiting
and looking at you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>

<p>
<q>He is looking at you,</q> the other boys chimed in.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you
hear, ask him that!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them,
and they at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't go near him, he'll hurt you,</q> cried Smurov in a warning
voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease
him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why
you hate him so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Find out then, find out,</q> cried the boys, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence,
straight towards the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better look out,</q> the boys called after him; <q>he won't
be afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did
Krassotkin.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him,
Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an
undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes
that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby
old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms
stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right
knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a
big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the
pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha
stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The
boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him,
became less defiant, and addressed him first.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone!</q>
he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,</q> observed
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I hit Smurov on the head!</q> cried the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone
at me on purpose,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
The boy looked darkly at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know you. Do you know me?</q> Alyosha continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me alone!</q> the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive
light in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, I am going,</q> said Alyosha; <q>only I don't know you
and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I
don't want to tease you. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Monk in silk trousers!</q> cried the boy, following Alyosha with
the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself
into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would
fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked
away. He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the
boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then,
when they say that you attack on the sly,</q> said Alyosha, turning
round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into
Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the
stone struck him on the elbow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would
attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like
a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha
had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with
both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and
it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain
and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at
last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's finger had been
badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha
took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured
hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting
all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well,</q> he said, <q>you see how badly you've bitten me.
That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
The boy stared in amazement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,</q>
Alyosha went on with the same serenity, <q>yet I must have done
something to you&mdash;you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.
So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky
Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the distance
as fast as ever, not turning his head, and no doubt still keeping up
his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as soon as
he had time, and to solve this mystery. Just now he had not the
time.

<head>Chapter IV. At The Hohlakovs'</head>

<p>
Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome
stone house of two stories, one of the finest in our town.
Though Madame Hohlakov spent most of her time in another province
where she had an estate, or in Moscow, where she had a house
of her own, yet she had a house in our town too, inherited from her
forefathers. The estate in our district was the largest of her three
estates, yet she had been very little in our province before this
time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you get my letter about the new miracle?</q> She spoke rapidly
and nervously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his
mother!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is dying to-day,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or
some one, about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am
I can't see him! The whole town is in excitement, they are all
suspense. But now&mdash;do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that's lucky,</q> cried Alyosha. <q>Then I shall see her here.
She told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, I know all. I've heard exactly what happened yesterday&mdash;and
the atrocious behavior of that&mdash;creature.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est tragique</foreign>,
and if I'd been in her place I don't know what I should have done.
And your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?&mdash;my
goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am forgetting, only fancy;
your brother is in there with her, not that dreadful brother who
was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he is
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
sitting with her talking; they are having a serious conversation. If
you could only imagine what's passing between them now&mdash;it's
awful, I tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale of
horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.
They both recognize it and revel in it. I've been watching for you!
I've been thirsting for you! It's too much for me, that's the worst
of it. I'll tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of
something else, the most important thing&mdash;I had quite forgotten
what's most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in hysterics?
As soon as she heard you were here, she began to be hysterical!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Maman</foreign>, it's you who are
hysterical now, not I,</q> Lise's voice
caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice
sounded as though she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost
to control it. Alyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise
was peeping through it, but that he could not see.
</p>

<p>
<q>And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make
me hysterical too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has
been so ill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for
the morning and for Herzenstube to come. He says that he can
make nothing of it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes
and says that he can make nothing of it. As soon as you approached
the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and insisted on being
wheeled back into this room here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, I didn't know he had come. It wasn't on his account
I wanted to be wheeled into this room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch
was coming. She was on the look-out for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My darling mamma, it's not at all clever of you. But if you
want to make up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma,
you'd better tell our honored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he
has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened
yesterday and although every one is laughing at him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who
laughs at him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can't do
without him. Oh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's the matter with you, mamma, darling?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>
night of fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting,
everlasting, that's the worst of it! Everything, in fact, everything....
Even that miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how
it has shattered me, that miracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And
that tragedy in the drawing-room, it's more than I can bear, I warn
you. I can't bear it. A comedy, perhaps, not a tragedy. Tell me,
will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he? Oh, my God!
What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes and see
that it's all nonsense, all nonsense.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should be very grateful,</q> Alyosha interrupted suddenly, <q>if
you could give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have
hurt it, and it's very painful.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked
with blood. Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!</q>
</p>

<p>
But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha's finger through the crack, she
flung the door wide open.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, come here,</q> she cried, imperiously. <q>No nonsense now!
Good heavens, why did you stand there saying nothing about it all
this time? He might have bled to death, mamma! How did you
do it? Water, water! You must wash it first of all, simply hold it
in cold water to stop the pain, and keep it there, keep it there....
Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin. But do make
haste,</q> she finished nervously. She was quite frightened at the sight
of Alyosha's wound.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't we send for Herzenstube?</q> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, you'll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will
come and say that he can make nothing of it! Water, water!
Mamma, for goodness' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such
a slowcoach and never can come quickly! Make haste, mamma, or
I shall die.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's nothing much,</q> cried Alyosha, frightened at this
alarm.
</p>

<p>
Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some lint, mamma, for mercy's sake, bring some lint and that
muddy caustic lotion for wounds, what's it called? We've got
some. You know where the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
in the right-hand cupboard, there's a big bottle of it there with the
lint.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don't scream and
don't fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it.
Where did you get such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting
for.
</p>

<p>
<q>First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like
this?</q> she asked Alyosha, quickly. <q>And then I'll talk to you about
something quite different. Well?</q>
</p>

<p>
Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother's absence was
precious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic
meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise
clasped her hands at his story.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?</q>
she cried angrily, as though she had a right to control him. <q>You
are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy!
But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me
all about it, for there's some mystery in it. Now for the second
thing, but first a question: does the pain prevent you talking about
utterly unimportant things, but talking sensibly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course not, and I don't feel much pain now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's because your finger is in the water. It must be changed
directly, for it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice
from the cellar and another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can
speak; will you give me the letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey
Fyodorovitch&mdash;be quick, for mamma will be back in a minute and
I don't want&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't got the letter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You've
got it in that pocket. I've been regretting that joke all night.
Give me back the letter at once, give it me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've left it at home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you can't consider me as a child, a little girl, after that silly
joke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me
the letter, if you really haven't got it&mdash;bring it to-day, you must,
you must.</q>
</p>

<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>

<p>
<q>To-day I can't possibly, for I am going back to the monastery
and I shan't come and see you for the next two days&mdash;three or four
perhaps&mdash;for Father Zossima&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very
much?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I didn't laugh at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because I believed all you said.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are insulting me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would
come to pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the
monastery. Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when
you reach the legal age we will be married. I shall love you. Though
I haven't had time to think about it, I believe I couldn't find a
better wife than you, and Father Zossima tells me I must marry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,</q> laughed Lise,
flushing crimson.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll wheel you about myself, but I'm sure you'll get well by
then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are mad,</q> said Lise, nervously, <q>to make all this nonsense
out of a joke! Here's mamma, very <foreign rend='italic'>à propos</foreign>, perhaps.
Mamma, how slow you always are, how can you be so long! And
here's Yulia with the ice!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, Lise, don't scream, above all things don't scream. That
scream drives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in
another place? I've been hunting and hunting&mdash;I do believe you
did it on purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I couldn't tell that he would come with a bad finger, or
else perhaps I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma,
you begin to say really witty things.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling
for Alexey Fyodorovitch's sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey
Fyodorovitch, what's killing me is no one thing in particular, not
Herzenstube, but everything together, that's what is too much
for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,</q> Lise
laughed gayly. <q>Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma.
That's simply Goulard's water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>
the name now, but it's a splendid lotion. Would you believe it,
mamma, on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street,
and it was a boy bit his finger, isn't he a child, a child himself? Is
he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he wants to be
married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn't it be funny,
wouldn't it be awful?</q>
</p>

<p>
And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly
at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing?
It's quite out of place&mdash;and perhaps the boy was rabid.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your
boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad
and bite any one near him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey
Fyodorovitch! I couldn't have done it. Do you still feel the pain?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's nothing much now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't feel afraid of water?</q> asked Lise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, that's enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick
talking of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once
Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here, Alexey
Fyodorovitch, she simply rushed at me, she's dying to see you,
dying!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can't go just now, he is
in too much pain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all, I can go quite well,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>What! You are going away? Is that what you say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, when I've seen them, I'll come back here and we can talk
as much as you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at
once, for I am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as
I can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don't
trouble to come and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your
monastery and a good riddance. I want to sleep, I didn't sleep all
night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would
sleep!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know what I've done.... I'll stay another three minutes,
five if you like,</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>

<p>
<q>Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a
monster.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too
capricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one
has with nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep
after seeing you. How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how
fortunate it is!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it,
mamma.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> Madame
Hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid
whisper. <q>I don't want to suggest anything, I don't want to lift
the veil, you will see for yourself what's going on. It's appalling.
It's the most fantastic farce. She loves your brother, Ivan, and she
is doing her utmost to persuade herself she loves your brother,
Dmitri. It's appalling! I'll go in with you, and if they don't turn
me out, I'll stay to the end.</q>

<head>Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room</head>

<p>
But in the drawing-room the conversation was already over.
Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute.
At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan
Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale,
and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve
a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha.
During the preceding month it had been several times suggested
to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina
Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant <q>to carry her off</q>
from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous,
though it worried him extremely. He loved both his
brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri
had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan
was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In
what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha
had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna
had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed
it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was
incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri,
and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such
a passion.
</p>

<p>
But during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had
struck him. The word <q>lacerating,</q> which Madame Hohlakov had
just uttered, almost made him start, because half waking up towards
daybreak that night he had cried out <q>Laceration, laceration,</q>
probably applying it to his dream. He had been dreaming all night
of the previous day's scene at Katerina Ivanovna's. Now Alyosha
was impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and persistent assertion
that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and only deceived
herself through some sort of pose, from <q>self-laceration,</q> and tortured
herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied
duty of gratitude. <q>Yes,</q> he thought, <q>perhaps the whole truth
lies in those words.</q> But in that case what was Ivan's position?
Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna's
must dominate, and she could only dominate some one like Dmitri,
and never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri might at last submit to her
domination <q>to his own happiness</q> (which was what Alyosha would
have desired), but Ivan&mdash;no, Ivan could not submit to her, and
such submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha could not
help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and reflections
flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room. Another
idea, too, forced itself upon him: <q>What if she loved neither
of them&mdash;neither Ivan nor Dmitri?</q>
</p>

<p>
It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his
own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him
during the last month. <q>What do I know about love and women
and how can I decide such questions?</q> he thought reproachfully,
after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was impossible not to
think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense
importance in his brothers' lives and that a great deal
depended upon it.
</p>

<p>
<q>One reptile will devour the other,</q> Ivan had pronounced the
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>
day before, speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan
looked upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was
it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had,
of course, escaped Ivan unawares yesterday, but that only made it
more important. If he felt like that, what chance was there of
peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new grounds for hatred
and hostility in their family? And with which of them was Alyosha
to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them?
He loved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst
of these conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this
maze, and Alyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty, because
his love was always of an active character. He was incapable of
passive love. If he loved any one, he set to work at once to help
him. And to do so he must know what he was aiming at; he must
know for certain what was best for each, and having ascertained
this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of a definite
aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all
sides. <q>It was lacerating,</q> as was said just now. But what could he
understand even in this <q>laceration</q>? He did not understand the
first word in this perplexing maze.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to
Ivan, who had already got up to go, <q>A minute! Stay another
minute! I want to hear the opinion of this person here whom I
trust absolutely. Don't go away,</q> she added, addressing Madame
Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down beside her, and Madame
Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear
friends,</q> she began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine
tears of suffering, and Alyosha's heart warmed to her at once.
<q>You, Alexey Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable
scene, and saw what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch,
he did. What he thought of me yesterday I don't know. I
only know one thing, that if it were repeated to-day, this minute, I
should express the same feelings again as yesterday&mdash;the same feelings,
the same words, the same actions. You remember my actions,
Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them</q> ... (as
she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). <q>I must tell you that
I can't get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don't even
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
know whether I still love <emph>him</emph>. I feel <emph>pity</emph> for him, and that
is a poor sign of love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I
shouldn't be sorry for him now, but should hate him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha
shuddered inwardly. <q>That girl is truthful and sincere,</q> he
thought, <q>and she does not love Dmitri any more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true, that's true,</q> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait, dear. I haven't told you the chief, the final decision I
came to during the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a
terrible one&mdash;for me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to
change it&mdash;nothing. It will be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful
and generous adviser, the one friend I have in the world,
Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep insight into the heart, approves
and commends my decision. He knows it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I approve of it,</q> Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive
my calling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch,
too, to tell me before my two friends whether I am right.
I feel instinctively that you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are
a dear brother to me),</q> she said again ecstatically, taking his cold
hand in her hot one, <q>I foresee that your decision, your approval, will
bring me peace, in spite of all my sufferings, for, after your words,
I shall be calm and submit&mdash;I feel that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know what you are asking me,</q> said Alyosha, flushing.
<q>I only know that I love you and at this moment wish for your
happiness more than my own!... But I know nothing about
such affairs,</q> something impelled him to add hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
<q>In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief
thing is honor and duty and something higher&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;but
higher perhaps even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible
feeling in my heart, and it compels me irresistibly. But it
may all be put in two words. I've already decided, even if he marries
that&mdash;creature,</q> she began solemnly, <q>whom I never, never can
forgive, <emph>even then I will not abandon him</emph>. Henceforward I will
never, never abandon him!</q> she cried, breaking into a sort of pale,
hysterical ecstasy. <q>Not that I would run after him continually,
get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away to another
town&mdash;where you like&mdash;but I will watch over him all my life&mdash;I
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
will watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy
with that woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let
him come to me and he will find a friend, a sister.... Only a
sister, of course, and so for ever; but he will learn at least that that
sister is really his sister, who loves him and has sacrificed all her life
to him. I will gain my point. I will insist on his knowing me and
confiding entirely in me, without reserve,</q> she cried, in a sort of
frenzy. <q>I will be a god to whom he can pray&mdash;and that, at least,
he owes me for his treachery and for what I suffered yesterday
through him. And let him see that all my life I will be true to him
and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue and betraying
me. I will&mdash;I will become nothing but a means for his happiness,
or&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;an instrument, a machine for his happiness,
and that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may
see that all his life! That's my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully
approves me.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea
with more dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried
and crude. It was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed
that she was still smarting from yesterday's insult, and that her pride
craved satisfaction. She felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened,
an unpleasant look came into her eyes. Alyosha at once saw
it and felt a pang of sympathy. His brother Ivan made it worse
by adding:
</p>

<p>
<q>I've only expressed my own view,</q> he said. <q>From any one
else, this would have been affected and overstrained, but from you&mdash;no.
Any other woman would have been wrong, but you are
right. I don't know how to explain it, but I see that you are absolutely
genuine and, therefore, you are right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But that's only for the moment. And what does this moment
stand for? Nothing but yesterday's insult.</q> Madame Hohlakov obviously
had not intended to interfere, but she could not refrain
from this very just comment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, quite so,</q> cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously
annoyed at being interrupted, <q>in any one else this moment
would be only due to yesterday's impression and would be only a
moment. But with Katerina Ivanovna's character, that moment
will last all her life. What for any one else would be only a
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
promise is for her an everlasting burdensome, grim perhaps, but
unflagging duty. And she will be sustained by the feeling of this
duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna, will henceforth
be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your own
heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will
be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment
of a bold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate
in any case, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of
it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make
you resigned to everything else.</q>
</p>

<p>
This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with
intention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke
ironically and with intention.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!</q> Madame Hohlakov cried
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know
what you will say!</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears.
Alyosha got up from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's nothing, nothing!</q> she went on through her tears. <q>I'm upset,
I didn't sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends
as you and your brother I still feel strong&mdash;for I know&mdash;you two
will never desert me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow&mdash;perhaps to-morrow&mdash;and
to leave you for a long time&mdash;And, unluckily, it's unavoidable,</q>
Ivan said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>To-morrow&mdash;to Moscow!</q> her face was suddenly contorted;
<q>but&mdash;but, dear me, how fortunate!</q> she cried in a voice suddenly
changed. In one instant there was no trace left of her tears. She
underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha.
Instead of a poor, insulted girl, weeping in a sort of <q>laceration,</q>
he saw a woman completely self-possessed and even exceedingly
pleased, as though something agreeable had just happened.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,</q> she
corrected herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. <q>Such a
friend as you are could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy
at losing you.</q> She rushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his
hands, pressed them warmly. <q>But what is fortunate is that you
will be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
all the horror of my present position. You can speak with complete
openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will know
how to do that. You can't think how wretched I was yesterday
and this morning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful
letter&mdash;for one can never tell such things in a letter.... Now it
will be easy for me to write, for you will see them and explain
everything. Oh, how glad I am! But I am only glad of that,
believe me. Of course, no one can take your place.... I will run
at once to write the letter,</q> she finished suddenly, and took a step
as though to go out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so
desperately anxious to hear?</q> cried Madame Hohlakov. There was
a sarcastic, angry note in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I had not forgotten that,</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to
a sudden standstill, <q>and why are you so antagonistic at such a
moment?</q> she added, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. <q>What
I said, I repeat. I must have his opinion. More than that, I must
have his decision! As he says, so it shall be. You see how anxious
I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch.... But what's the
matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!</q> Alyosha
cried suddenly in distress.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You
said that on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not
glad of that but sorry to be&mdash;losing a friend. But that was acting,
too&mdash;you were playing a part&mdash;as in a theater!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a theater? What? What do you mean?</q> exclaimed Katerina
Ivanovna, profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him,
you persist in telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is going,</q>
said Alyosha breathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not
sit down.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you talking about? I don't understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ...
I know I am not saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same,</q>
Alyosha went on in the same shaking and broken voice. <q>What I
see is that perhaps you don't love Dmitri at all ... and never
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>
have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri, too, has never loved
you ... and only esteems you.... I really don't know how I
dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody
here will tell the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What truth?</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical
ring in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll tell you,</q> Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though
he were jumping from the top of a house. <q>Call Dmitri; I will fetch
him&mdash;and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan's
and join your hands. For you're torturing Ivan, simply because you
love him&mdash;and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through
<q>self-laceration</q>&mdash;with an unreal love&mdash;because you've persuaded
yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha broke off and was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot&mdash;that's what
you are!</q> Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her
lips were moving with anger.
</p>

<p>
Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,</q> he said, with an expression
Alyosha had never seen in his face before&mdash;an expression of
youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling. <q>Katerina
Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the time that
I cared for her&mdash;though I never said a word of my love to her&mdash;she
knew, but she didn't care for me. I have never been her friend
either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my friendship.
She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revenged
with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually
receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that
first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult&mdash;that's what her
heart is like! She has talked to me of nothing but her love for
him. I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina Ivanovna, you
really love him. And the more he insults you, the more you love
him&mdash;that's your <q>laceration.</q> You love him just as he is; you love
him for insulting you. If he reformed, you'd give him up at once
and cease to love him. But you need him so as to contemplate continually
your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity. And
it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a great deal of humiliation
and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride....
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>
I am too young and I've loved you too much. I know that I ought
not to say this, that it would be more dignified on my part simply
to leave you, and it would be less offensive for you. But I am going
far away, and shall never come back.... It is for ever. I don't
want to sit beside a <q>laceration.</q>... But I don't know how to
speak now. I've said everything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna;
you can't be angry with me, for I am a hundred times more
severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never see
you again. Good-by! I don't want your hand. You have tortured
me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this moment.
I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand. <q>Den
Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,</q></q> he added, with a forced smile,
showing, however, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he
knew him by heart&mdash;which Alyosha would never have believed.
He went out of the room without saying good-by even to his hostess,
Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha clasped his hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan!</q> he cried desperately after him. <q>Come back, Ivan! No,
nothing will induce him to come back now!</q> he cried again, regretfully
realizing it; <q>but it's my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan
spoke angrily, wrongly. Unjustly and angrily. He must come back
here, come back,</q> Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an
angel,</q> Madame Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to
Alyosha. <q>I will do my utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from
going.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha,
but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble
notes in her hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she
began, addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice,
as though nothing had happened. <q>A week&mdash;yes, I think it was a
week ago&mdash;Dmitri Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust
action&mdash;a very ugly action. There is a low tavern here, and in it he
met that discharged officer, that captain, whom your father used
to employ in some business. Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his
temper with this captain, seized him by the beard and dragged him
out into the street and for some distance along it, in that insulting
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>
fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a child, who is at
the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for
his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while every one
laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot
think without indignation of that disgraceful action of <emph>his</emph> ...
one of those actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be
capable in his anger ... and in his passions! I can't describe it
even.... I can't find my words. I've made inquiries about his
victim, and find he is quite a poor man. His name is Snegiryov. He
