did something wrong in the army and was discharged. I can't tell
you what. And now he has sunk into terrible destitution, with
his family&mdash;an unhappy family of sick children, and, I believe, an
insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to
work as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought
if you ... that is I thought ... I don't know. I am so confused.
You see, I wanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,
to go to him, to find some excuse to go to them&mdash;I mean to that
captain&mdash;oh, goodness, how badly I explain it!&mdash;and delicately,
carefully, as only you know how to</q> (Alyosha blushed), <q>manage
to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles. He will be
sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,
rather, what do I mean? You see it's not by way of compensation
to prevent him from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to),
but simply a token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch's betrothed, not from himself.... But you
know.... I would go myself, but you'll know how to do it ever
so much better. He lives in Lake Street, in the house of a woman
called Kalmikov.... For God's sake, Alexey Fyodorovitch, do it
for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
She turned and disappeared behind the porti√®re so quickly that
Alyosha had not time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak.
He longed to beg her pardon, to blame himself, to say something,
for his heart was full and he could not bear to go out of the room
without it. But Madame Hohlakov took him by the hand and drew
him along with her. In the hall she stopped him again as before.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,
generous,</q> she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. <q>Oh, how I love
her, especially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything!
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, you didn't know, but I must tell you,
that we all, all&mdash;both her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even&mdash;have
been hoping and praying for nothing for the last month but that
she may give up your favorite Dmitri, who takes no notice of her
and does not care for her, and may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch&mdash;such
an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her more than
anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring it about,
and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But she has been crying&mdash;she has been wounded again,</q> cried
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Never trust a woman's tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never
for the women in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, you are spoiling him,</q> Lise's little voice cried from behind
the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,</q> Alyosha
repeated unconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse
for his indiscretion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel.
I am ready to say so a thousand times over.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel?</q> Lise's voice was
heard again.
</p>

<p>
<q>I somehow fancied all at once,</q> Alyosha went on as though he
had not heard Lise, <q>that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid
thing.... What will happen now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To whom, to whom?</q> cried Lise. <q>Mamma, you really want
to be the death of me. I ask you and you don't answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the moment the maid ran in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ...
hysterics.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the matter?</q> cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety.
<q>Mamma, I shall be having hysterics, and not she!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream, don't persecute me. At
your age one can't know everything that grown-up people know.
I'll come and tell you everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy
on us! I am coming, I am coming.... Hysterics is a good sign,
Alexey Fyodorovitch; it's an excellent thing that she is hysterical.
That's just as it ought to be. In such cases I am always against
the woman, against all these feminine tears and hysterics. Run and
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>
say, Yulia, that I'll fly to her. As for Ivan Fyodorovitch's going
away like that, it's her own fault. But he won't go away. Lise, for
mercy's sake, don't scream! Oh, yes; you are not screaming. It's I
am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted, delighted,
delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how
young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he
said all that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>savant</foreign>, and all of a sudden he behaved so
warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine,
like you.... And the way he repeated that German verse, it was
just like you! But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch,
make haste to carry out her commission, and then make haste back.
Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy's sake, don't keep
Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would
have opened the door to see Lise.
</p>

<p>
<q>On no account,</q> cried Lise. <q>On no account now. Speak
through the door. How have you come to be an angel? That's
the only thing I want to know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't dare to go away like that!</q> Lise was beginning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, I have a real sorrow! I'll be back directly, but I have a
great, great sorrow!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he ran out of the room.

<head>Chapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage</head>

<p>
He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been
before. He had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what?
In a love-affair. <q>But what do I know about it? What can I tell
about such things?</q> he repeated to himself for the hundredth time,
flushing crimson. <q>Oh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame
is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly
have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me
to reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>
together?</q> Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join
their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. <q>Though I acted
quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,</q> he concluded
suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna's commission took him to Lake Street, and his
brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street.
Alyosha decided to go to him in any case before going to the captain,
though he had a presentiment that he would not find his
brother. He suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his
way now, but he must find him anyhow. Time was passing: the
thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute
from the time he set off from the monastery.
</p>

<p>
There was one point which interested him particularly about
Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the captain's
son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying,
the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy
who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had
done to hurt him. Now Alyosha felt practically certain of this,
though he could not have said why. Thinking of another subject
was a relief, and he resolved to think no more about the <q>mischief</q>
he had done, and not to torture himself with remorse, but to do what
he had to do, let come what would. At that thought he was completely
comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he
felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought
from his father's, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker,
his son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at
Alyosha. <q>He hasn't slept here for the last three nights. Maybe
he has gone away,</q> the old man said in answer to Alyosha's persistent
inquiries. Alyosha saw that he was answering in accordance
with instructions. When he asked whether he were not at Grushenka's
or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke so freely on purpose),
all three looked at him in alarm. <q>They are fond of him,
they are doing their best for him,</q> thought Alyosha. <q>That's good.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little
house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street,
and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary
cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening into the
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the
house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer
to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood
that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door
across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to be a simple
cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open the
door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew
from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family. <q>Either
they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are
waiting for me to open the door. I'd better knock first,</q> and he
knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval of
perhaps ten seconds.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who's there?</q> shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.
</p>

<p>
Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He
found himself in a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it
was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there
were several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove.
From the stove to the window on the left was a string running
across the room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was a
bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with
knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print-covered
pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other
there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was
screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this
curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The
rough square table of plain wood had been moved into the middle
window. The three windows, which consisted each of four tiny
greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and were close shut, so
that the room was not very light and rather stuffy. On the table
was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs, a half-eaten
piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.
</p>

<p>
A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was
sitting on a chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and
yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she
was ill. But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in the
poor woman's eyes&mdash;a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty
pride. And while he was talking to her husband, her big brown
eyes moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
and questioning expression. Beside her at the window stood a young
girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but very neatly
dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in. Beside
the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad
sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled
<q>with withered legs,</q> as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches
stood in the corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle
eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man
of forty-five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried eggs. He
was spare, small and weakly built. He had reddish hair and a
scanty light-colored beard, very much like a wisp of tow (this
comparison and the phrase <q>a wisp of tow</q> flashed at once into
Alyosha's mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).
It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there
was no other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he
leapt up from the bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping
his mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to
come to!</q> the girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man
spun round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited
and breaking voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,</q> he turned
again to Alyosha, <q>what has brought you to&mdash;our retreat?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had
seen him. There was something angular, flurried and irritable
about him. Though he had obviously just been drinking, he was not
drunk. There was extraordinary impudence in his expression, and
yet, strange to say, at the same time there was fear. He looked like
a man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to
it, and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself.
Or, better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is
horribly afraid you will hit him. In his words and in the intonation
of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor, at times
spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting from one
tone to another. The question about <q>our retreat</q> he had asked as
it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close
to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed
in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>
checked trousers of an extremely light color, long out of fashion,
and of very thin material. They were so crumpled and so short
that he looked as though he had grown out of them like a boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Alexey Karamazov,</q> Alyosha began in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>I quite understand that, sir,</q> the gentleman snapped out at
once to assure him that he knew who he was already. <q>I am Captain
Snegiryov, sir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led
you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with
you&mdash;if only you allow me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That's what
they used to say in the old comedies, <q>kindly be seated,</q></q> and with
a rapid gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden
chair, not upholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of
the room; then, taking another similar chair for himself, he sat down
facing Alyosha, so close to him that their knees almost touched.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian
infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though
I might not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my
life I've learnt to say <q>sir.</q> It's a word you use when you've come
down in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very true,</q> smiled Alyosha. <q>But is it used involuntarily
or on purpose?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I didn't
use the word <q>sir</q> all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water
I began to say <q>sir.</q> It's the work of a higher power. I see you are
interested in contemporary questions, but how can I have excited
your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise
of hospitality?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've come&mdash;about that business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>About what business?</q> the captain interrupted impatiently.
</p>

<p>
<q>About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About
my <q>wisp of tow,</q> then?</q> He moved closer so that his knees positively
knocked against Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed
like a thread.
</p>

<p>
<q>What wisp of tow?</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>

<p>
<q>He is come to complain of me, father!</q> cried a voice familiar
to Alyosha&mdash;the voice of the schoolboy&mdash;from behind the curtain.
<q>I bit his finger just now.</q> The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha
saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and
the chair in the corner under the ikons. The boy lay covered by
his coat and an old wadded quilt. He was evidently unwell, and,
judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a fever. He looked at
Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home and could
not be touched.
</p>

<p>
<q>What! Did he bite your finger?</q> The captain jumped up
from his chair. <q>Was it your finger he bit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There
were six of them against him alone. I went up to him, and he
threw a stone at me and then another at my head. I asked him
what I had done to him. And then he rushed at me and bit my
finger badly, I don't know why.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll thrash him, sir, at once&mdash;this minute!</q> The captain jumped
up from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ...
I don't want him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you suppose I'd thrash him? That I'd take my Ilusha
and thrash him before you for your satisfaction? Would you
like it done at once, sir?</q> said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha,
as though he were going to attack him. <q>I am sorry about your
finger, sir; but instead of thrashing Ilusha, would you like me to
chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to
satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers would be
enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won't ask for the
fifth one too?</q> He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every
feature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely
defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think I understand it all now,</q> said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,
still keeping his seat. <q>So your boy is a good boy, he loves
his father, and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant....
Now I understand it,</q> he repeated thoughtfully. <q>But my brother
Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action, I know that, and if only
it is possible for him to come to you, or better still, to meet you in
<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>
that same place, he will ask your forgiveness before every one&mdash;if
you wish it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness?
And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn't he?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in
any way you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before
me in that very tavern&mdash;<q>The Metropolis</q> it's called&mdash;or in the
market-place, he would do it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he would even go down on his knees.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears
and pierced me to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother's
generosity. Allow me to introduce my family, my two daughters
and my son&mdash;my litter. If I die, who will care for them, and while
I live who but they will care for a wretch like me? That's a great
thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort, sir. For
there must be some one able to love even a man like me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that's perfectly true!</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and
you put us to shame!</q> cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning
to her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a little, Varvara!</q> cried her father, speaking peremptorily
but looking at her quite approvingly. <q>That's her character,</q> he
said, addressing Alyosha again.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>And in all nature there was naught</q></l>
<l>That could find favor in his eyes&mdash;</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>or rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But
now let me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled,
she is forty-three; she can move, but very little. She is of
humble origin. Arina Petrovna, compose your countenance. This
is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
He took him by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him
up. <q>You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It's not the
Karamazov, mamma, who ... h'm ... etcetera, but his brother,
radiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna, come,
mamma, first your hand to be kissed.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he kissed his wife's hand respectfully and even tenderly. The
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>
girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an
expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring
face of the woman.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,</q>
he whispered again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of
Tchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He
calls me crippled, but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels,
and I am shriveled up myself. Once I used to be so fat, but
now it's as though I had swallowed a needle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We are of humble origin,</q> the captain muttered again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, father, father!</q> the hunchback girl, who had till then been
silent on her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
<q>Buffoon!</q> blurted out the girl at the window.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you heard our news?</q> said the mother, pointing at her
daughters. <q>It's like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we
have music again. When we were with the army, we used to have
many such guests. I don't mean to make any comparisons; every
one to their taste. The deacon's wife used to come then and say,
<q>Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart, but Nastasya
Petrovna,</q> she would say, <q>is of the brood of hell.</q> <q>Well,</q> I
said, <q>that's a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.</q> <q>And you
want keeping in your place,</q> says she. <q>You black sword,</q> said I,
<q>who asked you to teach me?</q> <q>But my breath,</q> says she, <q>is clean,
and yours is unclean.</q> <q>You ask all the officers whether my breath
is unclean.</q> And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long
ago I was sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general
come in who came here for Easter, and I asked him: <q>Your Excellency,</q>
said I, <q>can a lady's breath be unpleasant?</q> <q>Yes,</q> he
answered; <q>you ought to open a window-pane or open the door, for
the air is not fresh here.</q> And they all go on like that! And what
is my breath to them? The dead smell worse still! <q>I won't spoil
the air,</q> said I, <q>I'll order some slippers and go away.</q> My darlings,
don't blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I can't
please you? There's only Ilusha who comes home from school and
loves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>
mother&mdash;forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become
unpleasant to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed
down her cheeks. The captain rushed up to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely.
Every one loves you, every one adores you.</q> He began kissing both
her hands again and tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin,
he began wiping away her tears. Alyosha fancied that he
too had tears in his eyes. <q>There, you see, you hear?</q> he turned
with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the poor imbecile.
</p>

<p>
<q>I see and hear,</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, father, how can you&mdash;with him! Let him alone!</q> cried
the boy, sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing
eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never
lead to anything!</q> shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make haste
to satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and
I'll put on mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in
earnest, but not within these walls. This girl sitting here is my
daughter Nina; I forgot to introduce her to you. She is a heavenly
angel incarnate ... who has flown down to us mortals,... if
you can understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!</q>
Varvara went on indignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool
just now, she is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good
reason to call me so. Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must
make an end.</q>
</p>

<p>
And, snatching Alyosha's hand, he drew him out of the room into
the street.

<head>Chapter VII. And In The Open Air</head>

<p>
<q>The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense
of the word. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your
kind interest.</q>
</p>

<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>

<p>
<q>I too have something important to say to you,</q> observed Alyosha,
<q>only I don't know how to begin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure you must have business with me. You would never
have looked in upon me without some object. Unless you come
simply to complain of the boy, and that's hardly likely. And, by
the way, about the boy: I could not explain to you in there, but
here I will describe that scene to you. My tow was thicker a week
ago&mdash;I mean my beard. That's the nickname they give to my
beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri
Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I'd done nothing, he
was in a towering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged
me out of the tavern into the market-place; at that moment the
boys were coming out of school, and with them Ilusha. As soon
as he saw me in such a state he rushed up to me. <q>Father,</q> he cried,
<q>father!</q> He caught hold of me, hugged me, tried to pull me away,
crying to my assailant, <q>Let go, let go, it's my father, forgive him!</q>&mdash;yes,
he actually cried <q>forgive him.</q> He clutched at that hand,
that very hand, in his little hands and kissed it.... I remember
his little face at that moment, I haven't forgotten it and I never
shall!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear,</q> cried Alyosha, <q>that my brother will express his most
deep and sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in
that same market-place.... I'll make him or he is no brother
of mine!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aha, then it's only a suggestion! And it does not come from
him but simply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You
should have said so. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your
brother's highly chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give
expression to it at the time. He left off dragging me by my beard
and released me: <q>You are an officer,</q> he said, <q>and I am an officer, if
you can find a decent man to be your second send me your challenge.
I will give satisfaction, though you are a scoundrel.</q> That's
what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I retired with Ilusha, and
that scene is a family record imprinted for ever on Ilusha's soul.
No, it's not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen. Judge for
yourself. You've just been in our mansion, what did you see there?
Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and
hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>
student, dying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation
of the Russian woman on the banks of the Neva. I won't
speak of Ilusha, he is only nine. I am alone in the world, and if I
die, what will become of all of them? I simply ask you that. And
if I challenge him and he kills me on the spot, what then? What
will become of them? And worse still, if he doesn't kill me but
only cripples me: I couldn't work, but I should still be a mouth to
feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I
take Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That's
what it means for me to challenge him to a duel. It's silly talk and
nothing else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in
the middle of the market-place,</q> cried Alyosha again, with glowing
eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I did think of prosecuting him,</q> the captain went on, <q>but look
in our code, could I get much compensation for a personal injury?
And then Agrafena Alexandrovna<note place='foot'>Grushenka.</note>
sent for me and shouted at me:
<q>Don't dare to dream of it! If you proceed against him, I'll publish
it to all the world that he beat you for your dishonesty, and then
you will be prosecuted.</q> I call God to witness whose was the dishonesty
and by whose commands I acted, wasn't it by her own and
Fyodor Pavlovitch's? <q>And what's more,</q> she went on, <q>I'll dismiss
you for good and you'll never earn another penny from me. I'll
speak to my merchant too</q> (that's what she calls her old man)
<q>and he will dismiss you!</q> And if he dismisses me, what can I earn
then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for your
Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another
reason, but he means to make use of papers I've signed to go
to law against me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our
retreat. But now let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much?
I didn't like to go into it in our mansion before him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging
you on me as a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen
how he was throwing stones at his school-fellows! It's very dangerous.
They might kill him. They are children and stupid. A
stone may be thrown and break somebody's head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>
to-day. Not on the head but on the chest, just above the heart.
He came home crying and groaning and now he is ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them
on your account. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with
a pen-knife not long ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've heard about that too, it's dangerous. Krassotkin is an
official here, we may hear more about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would advise you,</q> Alyosha went on warmly, <q>not to send
him to school at all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger
is passed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Anger!</q> the captain repeated, <q>that's just what it is. He is a
little creature, but it's a mighty anger. You don't know all, sir.
Let me tell you more. Since that incident all the boys have been
teasing him about the <q>wisp of tow.</q> Schoolboys are a merciless
race, individually they are angels, but together, especially in schools,
they are often merciless. Their teasing has stirred up a gallant
spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy, a weak son, would have submitted,
have felt ashamed of his father, sir, but he stood up for his
father against them all. For his father and for truth and justice.
For what he suffered when he kissed your brother's hand and cried
to him <q>Forgive father, forgive him,</q>&mdash;that only God knows&mdash;and
I, his father. For our children&mdash;not your children, but ours&mdash;the
children of the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one&mdash;know
what justice means, sir, even at nine years old. How should
the rich know? They don't explore such depths once in their lives.
But at that moment in the square when he kissed his hand, at that
moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice means. That truth
entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,</q> the captain said
hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right fist against
his left palm as though he wanted to show how <q>the truth</q> crushed
Ilusha. <q>That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was delirious
all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I noticed
he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to the
window and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see
his mind was not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget
my troubles, sinful man as I am, and I don't remember much.
Mamma began crying, too&mdash;I am very fond of mamma&mdash;well, I
spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don't despise me for
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>
that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best men
amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don't remember
about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering
at him at school. <q>Wisp of tow,</q> they shouted, <q>your father was
pulled out of the tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged
forgiveness.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he
looked pale and wretched. <q>What is it?</q> I asked. He wouldn't
answer. Well, there's no talking in our mansion without mamma
and the girls taking part in it. What's more, the girls had heard
about it the very first day. Varvara had begun snarling. <q>You
fools and buffoons, can you ever do anything rational?</q> <q>Quite
so,</q> I said, <q>can we ever do anything rational?</q> For the time I
turned it off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for a
walk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always
the same way, along which we are going now&mdash;from our gate to
that great stone which lies alone in the road under the hurdle,
which marks the beginning of the town pasture. A beautiful and
lonely spot, sir. Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual.
He has a little hand, his fingers are thin and cold&mdash;he suffers with
his chest, you know. <q>Father,</q> said he, <q>father!</q> <q>Well?</q> said I. I
saw his eyes flashing. <q>Father, how he treated you then!</q> <q>It can't
be helped, Ilusha,</q> I said. <q>Don't forgive him, father, don't forgive
him! At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for it.</q>
<q>No, Ilusha,</q> said I, <q>I would not take money from him for anything.</q>
Then he began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and
kissed it again. <q>Father,</q> he said, <q>father, challenge him to a duel,
at school they say you are a coward and won't challenge him, and
that you'll accept ten roubles from him.</q> <q>I can't challenge him to
a duel, Ilusha,</q> I answered. And I told briefly what I've just told
you. He listened. <q>Father,</q> he said, <q>anyway don't forgive it.
When I grow up I'll call him out myself and kill him.</q> His eyes
shone and glowed. And of course I am his father, and I had to put
in a word: <q>It's a sin to kill,</q> I said, <q>even in a duel.</q> <q>Father,</q> he
said, <q>when I grow up, I'll knock him down, knock the sword out
of his hand, I'll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say: <q>I
could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!</q></q> You see what the
workings of his little mind have been during these two days; he
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>
must have been planning that vengeance all day, and raving about
it at night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found
out about it the day before yesterday, and you are right, I won't
send him to that school any more. I heard that he was standing up
against all the class alone and defying them all, that his heart was
full of resentment, of bitterness&mdash;I was alarmed about him. We
went for another walk. <q>Father,</q> he asked, <q>are the rich people
stronger than any one else on earth?</q> <q>Yes, Ilusha,</q> I said, <q>there
are no people on earth stronger than the rich.</q> <q>Father,</q> he said,
<q>I will get rich, I will become an officer and conquer everybody.
The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no one
will dare&mdash;</q> Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling.
<q>Father,</q> he said, <q>what a horrid town this is.</q> <q>Yes, Ilusha,</q> I said,
<q>it isn't a very nice town.</q> <q>Father, let us move into another town,
a nice one,</q> he said, <q>where people don't know about us.</q> <q>We will
move, we will, Ilusha,</q> said I, <q>only I must save up for it.</q> I was
glad to be able to turn his mind from painful thoughts, and we
began to dream of how we would move to another town, how we
would buy a horse and cart. <q>We will put mamma and your sisters
inside, we will cover them up and we'll walk, you shall have a lift
now and then, and I'll walk beside, for we must take care of our
horse, we can't all ride. That's how we'll go.</q> He was enchanted
at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse and driving
him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. We chattered
a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind
and comforted him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last
night everything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning,
he came back depressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I
took him by the hand and we went for a walk; he would not talk.
There was a wind blowing and no sun, and a feeling of autumn;
twilight was coming on. We walked along, both of us depressed.
<q>Well, my boy,</q> said I, <q>how about our setting off on our travels?</q>
I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the day before.
He didn't answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand.
Ah, I thought, it's a bad job; there's something fresh. We had
reached the stone where we are now. I sat down on the stone. And
<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>
in the air there were lots of kites flapping and whirling. There were
as many as thirty in sight. Of course, it's just the season for the
kites. <q>Look, Ilusha,</q> said I, <q>it's time we got out our last year's
kite again. I'll mend it, where have you put it away?</q> My boy
made no answer. He looked away and turned sideways to me. And
then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell on me,
threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. You
know, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back
their tears when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down,
their tears fall in streams. With those warm streams of tears, he
suddenly wetted my face. He sobbed and shook as though he were
in convulsions, and squeezed up against me as I sat on the stone.
<q>Father,</q> he kept crying, <q>dear father, how he insulted you!</q> And
I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other's arms. <q>Ilusha,</q> I said
to him, <q>Ilusha darling.</q> No one saw us then. God alone saw us,
I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your
brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won't thrash my boy for
your satisfaction.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery.
Alyosha felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been
some one else in his, Alyosha's place, the man would not have spoken
so openly and would not have told what he had just told. This
encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the verge of
tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!</q> he cried.
<q>If you could arrange it&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, sir,</q> muttered the captain.
</p>

<p>
<q>But now listen to something quite different!</q> Alyosha went on.
<q>I have a message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri,
has insulted his betrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you
have probably heard. I have a right to tell you of her wrong; I
ought to do so, in fact, for hearing of the insult done to you and
learning all about your unfortunate position, she commissioned me
at once&mdash;just now&mdash;to bring you this help from her&mdash;but only
from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor from
me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from
her! She entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been
insulted by the same man. She thought of you only when she had
<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>
just received a similar insult from him&mdash;similar in its cruelty, I
mean. She comes like a sister to help a brother in misfortune....
She told me to persuade you to take these two hundred roubles from
her, as from a sister, knowing that you are in such need. No one
will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander. There are the
two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take them unless&mdash;unless
all men are to be enemies on earth! But there are brothers even on
earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that,
you must,</q> and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble
notes.
</p>

<p>
They were both standing at the time by the great stone close to
the fence, and there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce
a tremendous impression on the captain. He started, but at first
only from astonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation
was the last thing he expected. Nothing could have been farther
from his dreams than help from any one&mdash;and such a sum!
</p>

<p>
He took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to
answer, quite a new expression came into his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>That for me? So much money&mdash;two hundred roubles! Good
heavens! Why, I haven't seen so much money for the last four
years! Mercy on us! And she says she is a sister.... And is that
the truth?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear that all I told you is the truth,</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
The captain flushed red.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan't be behaving like
a scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan't be a
scoundrel? No, Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,</q> he hurried,
touching Alyosha with both his hands. <q>You are persuading me to
take it, saying that it's a sister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart
won't you feel contempt for me if I take it, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan't! And no one will
ever know but me&mdash;I, you and she, and one other lady, her great
friend.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment
like this you must listen, for you can't understand what these
two hundred roubles mean to me now.</q> The poor fellow went on
rising gradually into a sort of incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm.
<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>
He was thrown off his balance and talked extremely fast, as though
afraid he would not be allowed to say all he had to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>Besides its being honestly acquired from a <q>sister,</q> so highly
respected and revered, do you know that now I can look after
mamma and Nina, my hunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube
came to me in the kindness of his heart and was examining
them both for a whole hour. <q>I can make nothing of it,</q> said he,
but he prescribed a mineral water which is kept at a chemist's here.
He said it would be sure to do her good, and he ordered baths, too,
with some medicine in them. The mineral water costs thirty
copecks, and she'd need to drink forty bottles perhaps; so I took the
prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there it
lies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved
in them, morning and evening. But how can we carry out such a
cure in our mansion, without servants, without help, without a bath,
and without water? Nina is rheumatic all over, I don't think I told
you that. All her right side aches at night, she is in agony, and,
would you believe it, the angel bears it without groaning for fear
of waking us. We eat what we can get, and she'll only take the
leavings, what you'd scarcely give to a dog. <q>I am not worth it, I
am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,</q> that's what her angel
eyes try to express. We wait on her, but she doesn't like it. <q>I am
a useless cripple, no good to any one.</q> As though she were not
worth it, when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness.
Without her, without her gentle word it would be hell among
us! She softens even Varvara. And don't judge Varvara harshly
either, she is an angel too, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came
to us for the summer, and she brought sixteen roubles she had
earned by lessons and saved up, to go back with to Petersburg in
September, that is now. But we took her money and lived on it, so
now she has nothing to go back with. Though indeed she couldn't
go back, for she has to work for us like a slave. She is like an overdriven
horse with all of us on her back. She waits on us all, mends
and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And mamma is
capricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant
with this money, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get
medicines for the dear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg,
<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>
I can buy beef, I can feed them properly. Good Lord, but
it's a dream!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness
and that the poor fellow had consented to be made happy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,</q> the captain began to talk
with frenzied rapidity, carried away by a new day-dream. <q>Do
you know that Ilusha and I will perhaps really carry out our dream.
We will buy a horse and cart, a black horse, he insists on its being
black, and we will set off as we pretended the other day. I have an
old friend, a lawyer in K. province, and I heard through a trustworthy
man that if I were to go he'd give me a place as clerk in his
office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So I'd just put mamma
and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and I'd walk, I'd
walk.... Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid that's
owing me, I should have perhaps enough for that too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There would be enough!</q> cried Alyosha. <q>Katerina Ivanovna
will send you as much more as you need, and you know, I have
money too, take what you want, as you would from a brother, from
a friend, you can give it back later.... (You'll get rich, you'll
get rich!) And you know you couldn't have a better idea than to
move to another province! It would be the saving of you, especially
of your boy&mdash;and you ought to go quickly, before the winter, before
the cold. You must write to us when you are there, and we
will always be brothers.... No, it's not a dream!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing
at him he stopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched
and his lips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face.
His lips were moving as though trying to articulate something; no
sound came, but still his lips moved. It was uncanny.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q> asked Alyosha, startled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,</q> muttered the captain,
faltering, looking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air
of desperate resolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin
on his lips. <q>I ... you, sir ... wouldn't you like me to show
you a little trick I know?</q> he murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid
whisper, his voice no longer faltering.
</p>

<p>
<q>What trick?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A pretty trick,</q> whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>
on the left side, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the matter? What trick?</q> Alyosha cried, now thoroughly
alarmed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, look,</q> squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him
the two notes which he had been holding by one corner between
his thumb and forefinger during the conversation, he crumpled them
up savagely and squeezed them tight in his right hand. <q>Do you
see, do you see?</q> he shrieked, pale and infuriated. And suddenly
flinging up his hand, he threw the crumpled notes on the sand. <q>Do
you see?</q> he shrieked again, pointing to them. <q>Look there!</q>
</p>

<p>
And with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel,
gasping and exclaiming as he did so:
</p>

<p>
<q>So much for your money! So much for your money! So much
for your money! So much for your money!</q>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and
his whole figure expressed unutterable pride.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his
honor,</q> he cried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly
and began to run; but he had not run five steps before he turned
completely round and kissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another
five paces and then turned round for the last time. This time his
face was not contorted with laughter, but quivering all over with
tears. In a tearful, faltering, sobbing voice he cried:
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for
our shame?</q>
</p>

<p>
And then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him,
inexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the
man had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes.
He did not turn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not
follow him and call him back, he knew why. When he was out of
sight, Alyosha picked up the two notes. They were very much
crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into the sand, but
were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha unfolded
them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out,
he folded them up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina
Ivanovna to report on the success of her commission.

<head>Chapter I. The Engagement</head>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha.
She was flustered; something important had happened.
Katerina Ivanovna's hysterics had ended in a fainting fit, and then
<q>a terrible, awful weakness had followed, she lay with her eyes
turned up and was delirious. Now she was in a fever. They
had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts. The aunts
were already here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were
all sitting in her room, waiting. She was unconscious now, and
what if it turned to brain fever!</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. <q>This is serious,
serious,</q> she added at every word, as though nothing that had
happened to her before had been serious. Alyosha listened with
distress, and was beginning to describe his adventures, but she interrupted
him at the first words. She had not time to listen. She
begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her there.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise,</q> she whispered almost in his ear, <q>Lise has greatly surprised
me just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and
so my heart forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you
had gone, she began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at
you to-day and yesterday, though she was not laughing at you, but
only joking. But she was seriously sorry for it, almost ready to
cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never been really sorry
for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And you know
she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was in earnest.
She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and
don't take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am
never hard upon her, for she's such a clever little thing. Would you
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
believe it? She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood,
<q>the greatest friend of her childhood</q>&mdash;just think of that&mdash;<q>greatest
friend</q>&mdash;and what about me? She has very strong feelings
and memories, and, what's more, she uses these phrases, most unexpected
words, which come out all of a sudden when you least expect
them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, for instance: there used
to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early childhood.
Very likely it's standing there still; so there's no need to speak in
the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
they don't change quickly. <q>Mamma,</q> she said, <q>I remember this
pine-tree as in a dream,</q> only she said something so original about
it that I can't repeat it. Besides, I've forgotten it. Well, good-by!
I am so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey
Fyodorovitch, I've been out of my mind twice in my life. Go to
Lise, cheer her up, as you always can so charmingly. Lise,</q> she cried,
going to her door, <q>here I've brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch,
whom you insulted so. He is not at all angry, I assure you; on
the contrary, he is surprised that you could suppose so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Merci, maman.</foreign> Come in, Alexey
Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once
flushed crimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as
people always do in such cases, she began immediately talking of
other things, as though they were of absorbing interest to her at
the moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles,
Alexey Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ...
and she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ...
and you know, although mamma muddles things ...
she always rushes from one thing to another ... I cried when I
heard. Well, did you give him the money and how is that poor
man getting on?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The fact is I didn't give it to him, and it's a long story,</q> answered
Alyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his
regret at having failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too,
looked away, and that he, too, was trying to talk of other things.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but
at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole
of Lise's attention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under
<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>
the influence of the strong impression he had just received, and he
succeeded in telling his story well and circumstantially. In old
days in Moscow he had been fond of coming to Lise and describing
to her what had just happened to him, what he had read, or what
he remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they had made day-dreams
and woven whole romances together&mdash;generally cheerful and
amusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old
days in Moscow, two years before. Lise was extremely touched by
his story. Alyosha described Ilusha with warm feeling. When he
finished describing how the luckless man trampled on the money,
Lise could not help clasping her hands and crying out:
</p>

<p>
<q>So you didn't give him the money! So you let him run away!
Oh, dear, you ought to have run after him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Lise; it's better I didn't run after him,</q> said Alyosha, getting
up from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and
their case is hopeless?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to
them. He'll take the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be
sure to take it,</q> said Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering.
<q>You see, Lise,</q> he went on, stopping suddenly before her, <q>I made
one blunder, but that, even that, is all for the best.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What blunder, and why is it for the best?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he
has suffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering
why he took offense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last
minute, he did not know that he was going to trample on the notes.
And I think now that there was a great deal to offend him ...
and it could not have been otherwise in his position.... To begin
with, he was sore at having been so glad of the money in my presence
and not having concealed it from me. If he had been pleased,
but not so much; if he had not shown it; if he had begun affecting
scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they take money,
he might still endure to take it. But he was too genuinely delighted,
and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthful man&mdash;that's
the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked, his
voice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he kept
laughing such a laugh, or perhaps he was crying&mdash;yes, I am sure
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
he was crying, he was so delighted&mdash;and he talked about his daughters&mdash;and
about the situation he could get in another town....
And when he had poured out his heart, he felt ashamed at having
shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to hate me at once.
He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What had made
him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted
me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and
tried to intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had
begun embracing me; he kept touching me with his hands. This
must have been how he came to feel it all so humiliating, and then
I made that blunder, a very important one. I suddenly said to him
that if he had not money enough to move to another town, we
would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give him as much
as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him all at once.
Why, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him? You
know, Lise, it's awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when
other people look at him as though they were his benefactors....
I've heard that; Father Zossima told me so. I don't know how to
put it, but I have often seen it myself. And I feel like that myself,
too. And the worst of it was that though he did not know, up to
the very last minute, that he would trample on the notes, he had a
kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that. That's just what
made him so ecstatic, that he had that presentiment.... And
though it's so dreadful, it's all for the best. In fact, I believe nothing
better could have happened.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, why could nothing better have happened?</q> cried Lise,
looking with great surprise at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting
home, he would be crying with mortification, that's just what would
have happened. And most likely he would have come to me early
to-morrow, and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled
upon them as he did just now. But now he has gone home awfully
proud and triumphant, though he knows he has <q>ruined himself.</q>
So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept the two
hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he has already vindicated his
honor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot....
He couldn't know when he did it that I should bring it to him
again to-morrow, and yet he is in terrible need of that money.
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>
Though he is proud of himself now, yet even to-day he'll be thinking
what a help he has lost. He will think of it more than ever
at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morning he may be
ready to run to me to ask forgiveness. It's just then that I'll appear.
<q>Here, you are a proud man,</q> I shall say: <q>you have shown it;
but now take the money and forgive us!</q> And then he will take it!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words,
<q>And then he will take it!</q> Lise clapped her hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that's true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha,
how do you know all this? So young and yet he knows what's in
the heart.... I should never have worked it out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal
footing with us, in spite of his taking money from us,</q> Alyosha
went on in his excitement, <q>and not only on an equal, but even on
a higher footing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>On a higher footing</q> is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go
on, go on!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean there isn't such an expression as <q>on a higher footing</q>;
but that doesn't matter because&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, of course it doesn't matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You
know, I scarcely respected you till now&mdash;that is I respected
you but on an equal footing; but now I shall begin to respect
you on a higher footing. Don't be angry, dear, at my joking,</q> she
put in at once, with strong feeling. <q>I am absurd and small, but
you, you! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Isn't there in all our
analysis&mdash;I mean your analysis ... no, better call it ours&mdash;aren't
we showing contempt for him, for that poor man&mdash;in analyzing
his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh? In deciding so certainly
that he will take the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Lise, it's not contempt,</q> Alyosha answered, as though he
had prepared himself for the question. <q>I was thinking of that on
the way here. How can it be contempt when we are all like him,
when we are all just the same as he is? For you know we are just
the same, no better. If we are better, we should have been just the
same in his place.... I don't know about you, Lise, but I consider
that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul is not
sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I have
no contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
to care for most people exactly as one would for children, and for
some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we
would for the sick!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in
myself. I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I don't
see things. It's different with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, I don't believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so glad you say so, Lise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are
sometimes sort of formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal
really. Go to the door, open it gently, and see whether mamma is
listening,</q> said Lise, in a nervous, hurried whisper.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was
listening.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> Lise went on, flushing redder
and redder. <q>Give me your hand&mdash;that's right. I have to make a
great confession, I didn't write to you yesterday in joke, but in
earnest,</q> and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that
she was greatly ashamed of the confession.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three
times.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Lise, what a good thing!</q> cried Alyosha joyfully. <q>You
know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Sure? Upon my word!</q> She put aside his hand, but did not
leave go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh.
<q>I kiss his hand and he says, <q>What a good thing!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don't know how
to do it,</q> he muttered, blushing too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has
chosen me as his wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I
was in earnest. What a thing to say! Why, that's impertinence&mdash;that's
what it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?</q> Alyosha asked, laughing
suddenly.
</p>

<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>

<p>
<q>Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,</q> cried
Lise, looking tenderly and happily at him.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped
down and kissed her on her lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, what are you doing?</q> cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly
abashed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, forgive me if I shouldn't.... Perhaps I'm awfully stupid....
You said I was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was
stupid.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. <q>And in that dress!</q>
she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased
laughing and became serious, almost stern.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that
yet, and we shall have a long time to wait,</q> she ended suddenly.
<q>Tell me rather why you who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant,
choose a little idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am
awfully happy, for I don't deserve you a bit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in
a few days. If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that.
<emph>He</emph> told me to marry, too. Whom could I marry better than you&mdash;and
who would have me except you? I have been thinking it
over. In the first place, you've known me from a child and you've
a great many qualities I haven't. You are more light-hearted than
I am; above all, you are more innocent than I am. I have been
brought into contact with many, many things already.... Ah,
you don't know, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter
if you do laugh and make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing.
I am so glad you do. You laugh like a little child, but you think
like a martyr.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Like a martyr? How?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren't showing
contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul&mdash;that was the
question of a sufferer.... You see, I don't know how to express
it, but any one who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering.
Sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many
things already.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?</q>
murmured Lise in a failing voice, weak with happiness. <q>Listen,
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>
Alyosha. What will you wear when you come out of the monastery?
What sort of suit? Don't laugh, don't be angry, it's very, very important
to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't thought about the suit, Lise; but I'll wear whatever
you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white piqu√©
waistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe
that I didn't care for you when I said I didn't mean what I wrote?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, I knew that you&mdash;seemed to care for me, but I pretended
to believe that you didn't care for me to make it&mdash;easier
for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I
am awfully fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried
my fortune. I decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you
brought it out calmly and gave it to me (as might have been expected
from you) it would mean that you did not love me at all,
that you felt nothing, and were simply a stupid boy, good for nothing,
and that I am ruined. But you left the letter at home and
that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as not to give it
back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it, wasn't
it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it
was this morning, in this pocket. Here it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a
distance.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I told a lie if you like,</q> Alyosha laughed, too. <q>I told a lie so
as not to give you back the letter. It's very precious to me,</q> he
added suddenly, with strong feeling, and again he flushed. <q>It always
will be, and I won't give it up to any one!</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise looked at him joyfully. <q>Alyosha,</q> she murmured again,
<q>look at the door. Isn't mamma listening?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, Lise, I'll look; but wouldn't it be better not to look?
Why suspect your mother of such meanness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it's her
<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>
right, it's not meanness!</q> cried Lise, firing up. <q>You may be sure,
Alexey Fyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter
like myself I shall certainly spy on her!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really, Lise? That's not right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she
were listening to some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be
meanness, but when her own daughter is shut up with a young
man.... Listen, Alyosha, do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as
we are married, and let me tell you I shall open all your letters and
read them, so you may as well be prepared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course, if so&mdash;</q> muttered Alyosha, <q>only it's not right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won't quarrel the
very first day. I'd better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it's
very wrong to spy on people, and, of course, I am not right and
you are, only I shall spy on you all the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do, then; you won't find out anything,</q> laughed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>And, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that
too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the most
important things. Even if you don't agree with me, I shall do my
duty in the most important things.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you
not only in the most important matters, but in everything. And I
am ready to vow to do so now&mdash;in everything, and for all my life!</q>
cried Lise fervently, <q>and I'll do it gladly, gladly! What's more,
I'll swear never to spy on you, never once, never to read one of
your letters. For you are right and I am not. And though I shall
be awfully tempted to spy, I know that I won't do it since you
consider it dishonorable. You are my conscience now.... Listen,
Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately&mdash;both yesterday
and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble,
but I see you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,</q> answered Alyosha mournfully.
<q>I see you love me, since you guessed that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What grief? What about? Can you tell me?</q> asked Lise with
timid entreaty.
</p>

<pb n='241'/><anchor id='Pg241'/>

<p>
<q>I'll tell you later, Lise&mdash;afterwards,</q> said Alyosha, confused.
<q>Now you wouldn't understand it perhaps&mdash;and perhaps I couldn't
explain it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my brothers too,</q> murmured Alyosha, pondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,</q> said Lise suddenly.
</p>

<p>
He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.
</p>

<p>
<q>My brothers are destroying themselves,</q> he went on, <q>my father,
too. And they are destroying others with them. It's <q>the primitive
force of the Karamazovs,</q> as Father Pa√Øssy said the other day, a
crude, unbridled, earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above
that force? Even that I don't know. I only know that I, too, am
a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk! Am I a monk, Lise?
You said just now that I was.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I did.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And perhaps I don't even believe in God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't believe? What is the matter?</q> said Lise quietly and
gently. But Alyosha did not answer. There was something too
mysterious, too subjective in these last words of his, perhaps obscure
to himself, but yet torturing him.
</p>

<p>
<q>And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the
world, is going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound
up in soul I am with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I
shall come to you, Lise.... For the future we will be together.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together,
all our lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.</q>
