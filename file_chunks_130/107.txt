that moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is such a man alive?</q> Dmitri, beside himself with rage,
growled in a hollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked
almost deformed. <q>Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling
the earth?</q> He looked round at every one and pointed at the old
man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
rushing up to Father Iosif. <q>That's the answer to your <q>shameful!</q>
What is shameful? That <q>creature,</q> that <q>woman of loose behavior</q>
is perhaps holier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking
salvation! She fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment.
But she loved much, and Christ himself forgave the woman
<q>who loved much.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not for such love Christ forgave her,</q> broke impatiently
from the gentle Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here,
eating cabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon
a day, and you think you bribe God with gudgeon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is unendurable!</q> was heard on all sides in the cell.
</p>

<p>
But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way.
Father Zossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with
anxiety for the elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however,
in supporting him by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards
Dmitri and reaching him sank on his knees before him. Alyosha
thought that he had fallen from weakness, but this was not so. The
elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's feet till
his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so astounded that he
<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>
failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a faint smile
on his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!</q> he said, bowing on all sides
to his guests.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down
to him&mdash;what did it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, <q>Oh, God!</q>
hid his face in his hands, and rushed out of the room. All the
guests flocked out after him, in their confusion not saying good-by,
or bowing to their host. Only the monks went up to him again
for a blessing.
</p>

<p>
<q>What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic
or what?</q> said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to
reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular.
They were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage
at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen,</q> Miüsov answered
at once ill-humoredly, <q>but I will spare myself your company,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where's that
monk?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That monk,</q> that is, the monk who had invited them to dine
with the Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as
soon as they came down the steps from the elder's cell, as though
he had been waiting for them all the time.
</p>

<p>
<q>Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest
respect to the Father Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miüsov,
to his reverence, telling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen
circumstances I am unable to have the honor of being
present at his table, greatly as I should desire to do so,</q> Miüsov
said irritably to the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,</q> Fyodor
Pavlovitch cut in immediately. <q>Do you hear, Father; this gentleman
doesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at
once. And you shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the
Father Superior and good appetite to you. I will decline, and not
you. Home, home, I'll eat at home, I don't feel equal to it here,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable relative.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible
man!</q>
</p>

<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>

<p>
<q>I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim
the relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your
shuffling. I'll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan,
stay if you like. I'll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires
you to go to the Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to
apologize for the disturbance we've been making....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it true that you are going home? Aren't you lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what's happened!
Forgive me, gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset
besides! And, indeed, I am ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has
the heart of Alexander of Macedon and another the heart of the
little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dog Fido. I am ashamed!
After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, to gobble up the
monastery's sauces? I am ashamed, I can't. You must excuse
me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?</q> thought Miüsov,
still hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful
eyes. The latter turned round, and noticing that Miüsov was
watching him, waved him a kiss.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, are you coming to the Superior?</q> Miüsov asked Ivan
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded
dinner,</q> said Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the
fact that the monk was listening. <q>We ought, at least, to apologize
for the disturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What
do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father
won't be there,</q> observed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!</q>
</p>

<p>
They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On
the road through the copse he made one observation however&mdash;that
the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they
were more than half an hour late. He received no answer. Miüsov
looked with hatred at Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,</q>
he thought. <q>A brazen face, and the conscience of a
Karamazov!</q>

<head>Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career</head>

<p>
Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated
him on his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare
necessities. There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt
for a mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk
with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted
on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked
intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste,
you are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me stay here,</q> Alyosha entreated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will
wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And
remember, my son</q>&mdash;the elder liked to call him that&mdash;<q>this is not the
place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call me, leave
the monastery. Go away for good.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha started.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you
for great service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage.
And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear <emph>all</emph>
before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don't
doubt of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you. Do not
abandon Him and He will not abandon you. You will see great
sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is my last
message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.
Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not
only my days but my hours are numbered.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his
mouth quivered.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it again?</q> Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. <q>The
worldly may follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the
father who is departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me,
I must pray. Go, and make haste. Be near your brothers. And
not near one only, but near both.</q>
</p>

<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>

<p>
Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make
no protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed,
moreover, to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question
was on the tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He
knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had
thought fit. But evidently it was not his will. That action had
made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed blindly in its
mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.
</p>

<p>
As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the
monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt a
sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear
again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his approaching end. What
he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha
believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him?
How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should
he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery.
Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish.
He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the
hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed
at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go&mdash;about
five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but
at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin. He was waiting
for some one.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you waiting for me?</q> asked Alyosha, overtaking him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> grinned Rakitin. <q>You are hurrying to the Father Superior,
I know; he has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet
since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you
remember? I shan't be there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell
me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That's what I
want to ask you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What vision?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he tap the
ground with his forehead, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak of Father Zossima?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of Father Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tapped the ground?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what
does that vision mean?</q>
</p>

<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>

<p>
<q>I don't know what it means, Misha.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I knew he wouldn't explain it to you! There's nothing wonderful
about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there
was an object in the performance. All the pious people in the town
will talk about it and spread the story through the province, wondering
what it meant. To my thinking the old man really has a
keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your house stinks of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What crime?</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.
</p>

<p>
<q>It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and
your rich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready
for what may turn up. If something happens later on, it'll be:
<q>Ah, the holy man foresaw it, prophesied it!</q> though it's a poor sort
of prophecy, flopping like that. <q>Ah, but it was symbolic,</q> they'll
say, <q>an allegory,</q> and the devil knows what all! It'll be remembered
to his glory: <q>He predicted the crime and marked the criminal!</q>
That's always the way with these crazy fanatics; they cross
themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like
your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a
murderer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've
thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen,
Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between
two stools. Have you thought of it or not? Answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was
taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? Have you really?</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... I've not exactly thought it,</q> muttered Alyosha, <q>but
directly you began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought
of it myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your
father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime.
Then I'm not mistaken?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But wait, wait a minute,</q> Alyosha broke in uneasily. <q>What
has led you to see all this? Why does it interest you? That's the
first question.</q>
</p>

<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>

<p>
<q>Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them
separately. What led me to see it? I shouldn't have seen it, if I
hadn't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the
very heart of him all at once. I caught the whole man from one
trait. These very honest but passionate people have a line which
mustn't be crossed. If it were, he'd run at your father with a
knife. But your father's a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who
can never draw the line&mdash;if they both let themselves go, they'll
both come to grief.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't
come to that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest,
our Mitya (he is stupid, but honest), but he's&mdash;a sensualist. That's
the very definition and inner essence of him. It's your father has
handed him on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder
at you, Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a
Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to
a disease. But now, these three sensualists are watching one another,
with their knives in their belts. The three of them are
knocking their heads together, and you may be the fourth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri&mdash;despises her,</q>
said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has
openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her.
There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand
yet. A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's
body, or even with a part of a woman's body (a sensualist can understand
that), and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his
father and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he's honest,
he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive.
Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in his verse.
Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at their feet
without a thrill&mdash;and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no help
here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he
can't tear himself away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand that,</q> Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it
out at the first word,</q> said Rakitin, malignantly. <q>That escaped
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a
familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about sensuality,
I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're
a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you've thought
about, and what you know already! You are pure, but you've been
down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long time.
You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov&mdash;no
doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a
sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why
do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has
been begging me to bring you along. <q>I'll pull off his cassock,</q> she
says. You can't think how she keeps begging me to bring you. I
wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know,
she's an extraordinary woman, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank her and say I'm not coming,</q> said Alyosha, with a
strained smile. <q>Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you
my idea after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune,
brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you
Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your
brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown
motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits it's
a fraud himself&mdash;that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get
Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And
what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender
his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka.
And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness.
Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on
with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing
in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka.
His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her account
he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Miüsov
called her an <q>abandoned creature.</q> He's worse than a tom-cat in
love. At first she was only employed by him in connection with
his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly
realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And
they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path!
But Grushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them,
and teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of.
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't
marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his
purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes in; he has no money,
but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to marry her! to abandon
his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and
the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been
the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated,
provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well
come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is
waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry
off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her
dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a
man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't
be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know
as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy
girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of
his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man
who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between
the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so
that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying
himself at your expense.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?</q>
Alyosha asked sharply, frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows
that you know I'm speaking the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only
the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for
thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps
it's suffering he is seeking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What wild dream now? Oh, you&mdash;aristocrats!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage.
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who
don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's phrases.
Ah, Ivan has set you a problem!</q> cried Rakitin, with undisguised
malice. His face changed, and his lips twitched. <q>And the problem's
a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains&mdash;you'll
understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous. And did
you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of
the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful. (And
by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out:
<q>I will remember!</q>) An attractive theory for scoundrels!&mdash;(I'm
being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>poseurs</foreign>, <q>haunted by profound,
unsolved doubts.</q> He's showing off,
and what it all comes to is, <q>on the one hand we cannot but admit</q>
and <q>on the other it must be confessed!</q> His whole theory is a
fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue
even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love for
freedom, for equality, for fraternity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
though remembering something, he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that's enough,</q> he said, with a still more crooked smile.
<q>Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are
clever but ... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your
getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you
are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that
for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan.
Are you jealous of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother
Ivan with you. Don't you understand that one might very well
dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil
should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why
haven't I a right to abuse him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad.
He doesn't speak of you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna's
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
he was abusing me for all he was worth&mdash;you see what an interest
he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous one
after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express the
opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an archimandrite in
the immediate future and don't become a monk, I shall be sure to
go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer,
that I shall write for the next ten years, and in the end become the
owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic
side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping
a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in with both sides
and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's account,
the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the proceeds
and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the end
of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing
offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the
Neva, which they say is to be built in Petersburg.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of
it,</q> cried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different
in my mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You
can't have been at Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking
about you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him
tell it with my own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me, but
I overheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in
Grushenka's bedroom and I couldn't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch
was in the next room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!</q> cried Rakitin,
turning crimson. <q>Are you mad? You're out of your mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being
an ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about
playing the buffoon at other men's tables, and was only admitted to
the kitchen as a favor. I may be only a priest's son, and dirt in
the eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I
couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you
to understand that!</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin was intensely irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ...
how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?</q>
Alyosha flushed suddenly. <q>I tell you again, I heard that she was a
relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself
you're not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people
had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your
business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father,
is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are.
You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it?
Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the
Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have.
Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've
broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's
shouting out something after them from the steps. And your
father's shouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing.
Bah, and there goes Miüsov driving away in his carriage. You see,
he's going. And there's old Maximov running!&mdash;there must have
been a row. There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not
been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been
beaten? It would serve them right!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a
scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse
of a moment.
</p>

<head>Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene</head>

<p>
Miüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but
feel some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's
with Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt
that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's
cell, and so to have forgotten himself. <q>The monks were not to
blame, in any case,</q> he reflected, on the steps. <q>And if they're
decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't
argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
them that I've nothing to do with that Æsop,
that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this
affair, just as they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and
relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once.
He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become
much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the
wood and river in question were.
</p>

<p>
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the
Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not
a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether;
they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than
Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing
of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered
with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not
even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there
were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous
thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully
decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were
three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent
mead, and a large glass jug of kvas&mdash;both the latter made in
the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no
vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup
made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish
served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote,
and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these
good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where
he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got
information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious
temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and
nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would
play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable,
and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the
contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table
he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any
one else could have influenced him in that.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be
invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and one
other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They
were already waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The
Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his
guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black
hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed
to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive
his blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and
Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted
and complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.
</p>

<p>
<q>We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,</q> began Miüsov,
simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.
<q>Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor
of your hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father
Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with
his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ...
in fact, quite unseemly ... as</q>&mdash;he glanced at the monks&mdash;<q>your
reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognizing
that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and
begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
place.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miüsov completely recovered
his self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation
disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
</p>

<p>
The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a
slight bend of the head, replied:
</p>

<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>

<p>
<q>I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might
have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud.
All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before
him, with peculiar fervor.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last
prank. It must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and
really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father
Superior as though nothing had happened, after his disgraceful behavior
in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed
of himself&mdash;quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would
be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly
been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it,
when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own words
at the elder's: <q>I always feel when I meet people that I am lower
than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play
the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than
I.</q> He longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness.
He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been
asked, <q>Why do you hate so and so, so much?</q> And he had answered
them, with his shameless impudence, <q>I'll tell you. He has
done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since
I have hated him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating
for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively
quivered. <q>Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,</q> he
decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed
in the following words, <q>Well, there is no rehabilitating
myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will
show them I don't care what they think&mdash;that's all!</q>
</p>

<p>
He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned
to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no
clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control
himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of
obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for
which he could be legally punished. In the last resort, he could
always restrain himself, and had marveled indeed at himself, on that
score, sometimes. He appeared in the Father Superior's dining-room,
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving
to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company,
and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
them all boldly in the face. <q>They thought I had gone, and here
I am again,</q> he cried to the whole room.
</p>

<p>
For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at
once every one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively
scandalous, was about to happen. Miüsov passed immediately from
the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the
feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No! this I cannot endure!</q> he cried. <q>I absolutely cannot! and ...
I certainly cannot!</q>
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he
was beyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it he cannot?</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>that he absolutely
cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come
in or not? Will you receive me as your guest?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are welcome with all my heart,</q> answered the Superior.
<q>Gentlemen!</q> he added, <q>I venture to beg you most earnestly to
lay aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family
harmony&mdash;with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, it is impossible!</q> cried Miüsov, beside himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible
for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep
with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain.
You stung him by what you said about family harmony,
Father Superior, he does not admit he is my relation. That's right,
isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you mean me?</q> muttered Maximov, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I mean you,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. <q>Who else?
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von
Sohn was? It was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house
of harlotry&mdash;I believe that is what such places are called among
you&mdash;he was killed and robbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he
<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>
was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the
luggage van, and while they were nailing him up, the harlots sang
songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that
very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is happening? What's this?</q> voices were heard in the
group of monks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go,</q> cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, excuse me,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another
step into the room. <q>Allow me to finish. There in the cell
you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of
eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miüsov, my relation, prefers
to have <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plus de noblesse que de sincérité</foreign>
in his words, but I prefer in mine <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plus de
sincérité que de noblesse</foreign>, and&mdash;damn the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>noblesse</foreign>!
That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though
I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor,
and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in
Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else.
I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,
Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare,
and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have
been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give
you the last act of the performance. You know how things are
with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so
it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again.
Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a great
sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but
there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can it be
right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to
confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and
so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one
that I did this and that ... well, you understand what&mdash;sometimes
it would not be proper to talk about it&mdash;so it is really a scandal!
No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants,
I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod,
and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.</q>
</p>

<p>
We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look
for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors
which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our
<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>
monastery, but in others where the institution of elders existed)
that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment
of the authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament
of confession and so on and so on&mdash;absurd charges which had died
away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had
caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the current
of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,
prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not
understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for
on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in
the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind.
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But
as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking
absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience,
and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense.
And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would
be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,
and plunged forward blindly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How disgraceful!</q> cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me!</q> said the Father Superior. <q>It was said of old,
<q>Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil
sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the
correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.</q>
And so we humbly thank you, honored guest!</q> and he made Fyodor
Pavlovitch a low bow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut&mdash;sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old
phrases and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We
know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart,
as in Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Robbers</hi>. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want
the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that
I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you
expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will
come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in
the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a
monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward
up aloft for it&mdash;you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too,
Father Superior. What have they got here?</q> He went up to the
table. <q>Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie,
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the
bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided
it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing
earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the
tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy fathers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is too disgraceful!</q> said Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
Father Païssy kept obstinately silent. Miüsov rushed from the
room, and Kalganov after him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not
coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't
come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep
your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my
revenge for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured.</q> He
thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling.
<q>This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost
me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,
against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories
about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of
Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand,
nor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get
out of me!</q>
</p>

<p>
It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any
great part in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.
But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was
for one moment almost believing it himself. He was so touched he
was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was
time to draw back.
</p>

<p>
The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again
spoke impressively:
</p>

<p>
<q>It is written again, <q>Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor
that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded
and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.</q> And so will we.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.
Bethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son,
Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan
Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to
follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see
me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst;
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We
will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've
cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.</q> He
went out, shouting and gesticulating.
</p>

<p>
It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey!</q> his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him.
<q>You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow
and mattress, and leave no trace behind.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.
Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan
was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to
say good-by to Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible
scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode.
Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran
up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw
him running. He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put
his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and
clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in. <q>I am going
with you!</q> he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a
look of reckless glee in his face. <q>Take me, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. <q>Did I not say he
was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why,
how did you tear yourself away? What did you <hi rend='italic'>vonsohn</hi> there?
And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a
brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you,
brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun.
He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von
Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the
box, von Sohn!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave
Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was
quite by chance he did not fall.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on!</q> Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you
do that?</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.
</p>

<p>
But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you are a fellow,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
</p>

<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>

<p>
After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, <q>Why,
it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you
approved of it. Why are you angry now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,</q> Ivan
snapped sullenly.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>A drop of brandy would be nice now,</q> he observed sententiously,
but Ivan made no response.
</p>

<p>
<q>You shall have some, too, when we get home.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan was still silent.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you
will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away
stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.

<head>Chapter I. In The Servants' Quarters</head>

<p>
The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the
town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking
old house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was
roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all
sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases. There
were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike
them. <q>One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone in the
evening,</q> he used to say. It was his habit to send the servants
away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone. The
lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor Pavlovitch
used to have the cooking done there, although there was a kitchen
in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter and
summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The
house was built for a large family; there was room for five times
as many, with their servants. But at the time of our story there
was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son
Ivan. And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory,
and his old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov. Of
these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said
something already. He was firm and determined and went blindly
and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought by any
reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that it
was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife,
Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her
life, yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the
serfs. She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little
shop in Moscow with their small savings. But Grigory decided then,
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
once for all, that <q>the woman's talking nonsense, for every woman
is dishonest,</q> and that they ought not to leave their old master,
whatever he might be, for <q>that was now their duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you understand what duty is?</q> he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why
it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand,</q> Marfa answered
firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold
your tongue.</q>
</p>

<p>
And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch
promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory
knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his master.
It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an
obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong
enough <q>in some of the affairs of life,</q> as he expressed it, he found
himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other
emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them.
There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And
that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most
trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor
Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's
intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him a
good lecture. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch
was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle
and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained
the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted,
which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a
moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often
cruel in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was
sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious
terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form.
<q>My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times,</q> he used to
say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand,
in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and
unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his
secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that, not to
oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him with
anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need,
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
to defend him&mdash;from whom? From somebody unknown, but
terrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there
was <emph>another</emph> man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him
in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange
some quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old
servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry,
he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that
Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and
fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch
would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would
soon let him go again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he
had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and
sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had happened
to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha <q>pierced
his heart</q> by <q>living with him, seeing everything and blaming
nothing.</q> Moreover, Alyosha brought with him something his
father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt
for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected
devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was a
complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family
ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till
then loved nothing but <q>evil.</q> When Alyosha had left him, he
confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not
till then been willing to learn.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaïda
Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of
Dmitri, and that he had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna,
the poor <q>crazy woman,</q> against his master and any one who
chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy
wife had become something sacred to him, so that even now,
twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to her
from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,
Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his
words, without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight
whether he loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love
her, and she knew it.
</p>

<p>
Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,
cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>
in worldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything
without question or complaint ever since her marriage, and respected
him for his spiritual superiority. It was remarkable how little they
spoke to one another in the course of their lives, and only of the
most necessary daily affairs. The grave and dignified Grigory
thought over all his cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna
had long grown used to knowing that he did not need her
advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took
it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once,
and then only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's
marriage with Adelaïda Ivanovna, the village girls and
women&mdash;at that time serfs&mdash;were called together before the house
to sing and dance. They were beginning <q>In the Green Meadows,</q>
when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and
danced <q>the Russian Dance,</q> not in the village fashion, but as she
had danced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich
Miüsov family, in their private theater, where the actors were taught
to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his
wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave
her a lesson, pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating
was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
</p>

<p>
God had not blessed them with children. One child was born
but it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of
showing it. When Adelaïda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took
Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his hair and washed
him in a tub with his own hands, and looked after him for almost
a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for
which the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in the
face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his
own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth.
When it was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The
baby had six fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was
not only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the
garden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen
garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean-time
Grigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage
where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god-father, he suddenly
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
announced that the baby <q>ought not to be christened at all.</q>
He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing
with dull intentness at the priest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not?</q> asked the priest with good-humored surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because it's a dragon,</q> muttered Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>A dragon? What dragon?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory did not speak for some time. <q>It's a confusion of nature,</q>
he muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to
say more.
</p>

<p>
They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory
prayed earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child
remained unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long
as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to
notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when,
at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid
the child in its little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when
they were filling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and
bowed down to the earth. He did not for years afterwards mention
his child, nor did Marfa speak of the baby before him, and, even if
Grigory were not present, she never spoke of it above a whisper.
Marfa observed that, from the day of the burial, he devoted himself
to <q>religion,</q> and took to reading the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>,
for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and always putting on his
big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read aloud, only
perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow
got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of <q>the God-fearing
Father Isaac the Syrian,</q> which he read persistently for
years together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing
and loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to
the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood.
He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go
over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him
an expression of still greater gravity.
</p>

<p>
He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his
deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design,
been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which,
as he said later, had left a <q>stamp</q> upon his soul. It happened that,
on the very night after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
by the wail of a new-born baby. She was frightened and waked
her husband. He listened and said he thought it was more like
some one groaning, <q>it might be a woman.</q> He got up and dressed.
It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he
distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from
the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no
other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong,
high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern,
took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of
his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and
that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the
garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from
the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were
the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath-house, he
saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about
the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of
Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-house
and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the
baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to
speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter II. Lizaveta</head>

<p>
There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly,
and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This
Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, <q>not five foot within a wee bit,</q>
as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after
her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy
and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek
expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted,
wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost
black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap
on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits
of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the
ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman
with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead.
Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever
she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in
the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially
dear to God. Ilya's employers, and many others in the town,
especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better, and always
rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter.
But, although she allowed them to dress her up without resisting,
she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch, and
taking off all that had been given her&mdash;kerchief, sheepskin, skirt
or boots&mdash;she left them there and walked away barefoot in her
smock as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor
of the province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw
Lizaveta, and was wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And
though he was told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young
woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a
breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor
went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her
father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of
the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one
seemed to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of
our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She
would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every
one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were given a
copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms-jug of
the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market,
she would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would
stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the
lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything
but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,
where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept
watch on her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles
overlooked by them, she would not have touched a farthing. She
scarcely ever went to church. She slept either in the church porch
or climbed over a hurdle (there are many hurdles instead of fences
to this day in our town) into a kitchen garden. She used at least
once a week to turn up <q>at home,</q> that is at the house of her
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>
father's former employers, and in the winter went there every night,
and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People were amazed
that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to it, and,
although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some of
the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but
that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from
time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have
been proud?
</p>

<p>
It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September
(many years ago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from
the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions.
They passed through the <q>back-way,</q> which led between the back
gardens of the houses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads
out on to the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were
accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles and burdocks under
the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look
at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness.
It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry
whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a
woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance
that it was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was
among them, sprang forward and declared that it was by no means
impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it,
and so on.... It is true that at that time he was overdoing his
part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and entertain
the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality
he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time when
he had received the news of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and,
with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly
that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of
him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion;
and one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The
others repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with
the utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way. Later on,
Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them, and perhaps
it was so, no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew. But
five or six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and
sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find out
<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>
who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a
terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no
other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of
that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still
among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the
father of grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the
tale, even if there had been any foundation for it. But rumor
pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at
him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not
have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he
was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle
of the officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.
</p>

<p>
At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He
provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded
in bringing some people round to his side. <q>It's the wench's own
fault,</q> he asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict,
who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us,
as he had hidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible,
for it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just
at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people. But this
affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy
from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A
well-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take
her into her house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go
out until after the confinement. They kept a constant watch over
her, but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day,
and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her
condition, she managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained
a mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted
over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The
most likely explanation is that it happened naturally&mdash;that Lizaveta,
accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow
managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had
leapt down, injuring herself.
</p>

<p>
Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran
to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby,
but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home,
and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. <q>A child of God&mdash;an
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
orphan is akin to all,</q> he said, <q>and to us above others. Our
little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son
and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to
which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor).
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it
amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility.
The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later
on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him
Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.
</p>

<p>
So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant,
and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our
story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something
of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention
so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back
to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;In Verse</head>

<p>
Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the
command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But
in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his
way. He went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father
had been doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way
he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten
to add that his father's shouts, commanding him to return home
<q>with his mattress and pillow</q> did not frighten him in the least.
He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely
<q>a flourish</q> to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in
our town who was celebrating his name-day with a party of friends,
getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own
crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife's clothes, and
finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of
course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers.
Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery
<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>
next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded
that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt
him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would
want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could
hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without
question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him,
and worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was
the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently
entreated him in the note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to
come and see her about something. This request and the necessity
of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart, and this
feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite
of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father Superior's. He was
not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak of and
what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a
woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life,
from early childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with
women. He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He
had been afraid of her from the first time he saw her. He had only
seen her two or three times, and had only chanced to say a few
words to her. He thought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious
girl. It was not her beauty which troubled him, but something
else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension
itself. The girl's aims were of the noblest, he knew that.
She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,
though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha
recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments,
a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her
house.
</p>

<p>
He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate
a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father.
Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had
a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with
her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri
before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he
could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and
he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute,
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed
gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the
direction of his terrible lady.
</p>

<p>
He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then
across the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our
town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And
meanwhile his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not yet
forgotten his command. He might be unreasonable, and so he had
to make haste to get there and back. So he decided to take a short
cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the ground. This
meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other
people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted
him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.
</p>

<p>
He had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging
to a little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of
this house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with
her daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals'
families in Petersburg. Now she had been at home a year, looking
after her sick mother. She always dressed up in fine clothes, though
her old mother and she had sunk into such poverty that they went
every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which
Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up for
soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even
had a long train&mdash;a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin,
who always knew everything that was going on in the town. He
had forgotten it as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the
garden, he remembered the dress with the train, raised his head,
which had been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite
unexpected.
</p>

<p>
Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something,
was leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously
afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha
ran up to the hurdle.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,</q>
Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper. <q>Climb in here quickly!
How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
the hurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help
him jump. Tucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle
with the agility of a bare-legged street urchin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done! Now come along,</q> said Mitya in an enthusiastic
whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where?</q> whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself
in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The
garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no one here. Why do you whisper?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!</q> cried Dmitri at the top of
his voice. <q rend='pre'>You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here
in secret, and on the watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's
a secret, I began whispering like a fool, when there's no need. Let
us go. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you.</q>

The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees
only along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees,
maples, limes and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an
empty grass space, from which several hundredweight of hay was
carried in the summer. The garden was let out for a few roubles
for the summer. There were also plantations of raspberries and currants
and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen garden
had been planted lately near the house.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden.
There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant,
elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green
summer-house, blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work,
but there was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows
when this summer-house was built. There was a tradition that it
had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called
von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It was all in decay,
the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled
musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed
in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which
it was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw
half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's brandy,</q> Mitya laughed. <q rend='pre'>I see your look: <q>He's drinking
again!</q> Distrust the apparition.</q>

<p>
<q rend='post'>I'm not drinking, I'm only <q>indulging,</q> as that pig, your Rakitin,
says. He'll be a civil councilor one day, but he'll always talk about
<q>indulging.</q> Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and
press you to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world&mdash;in
reality&mdash;in re-al-i-ty&mdash;(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!</q>
</p>

<p>
He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.
</p>

<p>
<q>No one but you and one <q>jade</q> I have fallen in love with, to
my ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in
love with a woman and yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk
about it gayly still. Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside
you and look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and
I'll go on talking, for the time has come. But on reflection, you
know, I'd better speak quietly, for here&mdash;here&mdash;you can never tell
what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, <q>the
story will be continued.</q> Why have I been longing for you? Why
have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's
five days since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I
can tell everything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow
I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending
and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling
down a precipice into a pit? That's just how I'm falling, but not in
a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At least, I
am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not enjoyment though, but ecstasy.
Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish
spirit&mdash;whatever it is! Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine,
how clear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it's still summer;
four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness! Where were you
going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's
first.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny
of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and
to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with
father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted
to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you really mean to send me?</q> cried Alyosha with a distressed
expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once.
But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's why
you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is her note.</q> Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya
looked through it quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for
sending him by the back-way, and he came to me like the golden
fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen,
brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some
one. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell an
angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and
judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that some one above
me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything
on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,
and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and
says, <q>Do this for me</q>&mdash;some favor never asked before that could
only be asked on one's deathbed&mdash;would that other refuse, if he were
a friend or a brother?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste! H'm!... Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you
hurry and worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the
world has taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't
understand ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you
didn't understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying?
<q>Be noble, O man!</q>&mdash;who says that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed,
his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were
silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> said Mitya, <q rend='pre'>you're the only one who won't laugh.
I should like to begin&mdash;my confession&mdash;with Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Hymn
to Joy</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>An die Freude</hi>! I don't know German, I only know it's
called that. Don't think I'm talking nonsense because I'm drunk. I'm
not a bit drunk. Brandy's all very well, but I need two bottles
to make me drunk:</q>

for I've made a decision once for
all. Forgive me the pun; you'll have to forgive me a lot more than
puns to-day. Don't be uneasy. I'm not spinning it out. I'm talking
sense, and I'll come to the point in a minute. I won't keep you
in suspense. Stay, how does it go?</q>
</p>

He raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:

There's a terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible

wallowing in dirt and drink. I hardly think of anything but
of that degraded man&mdash;if only I'm not lying. I pray God I'm
