
<p>
<q>Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?</q>
she said thickly. <q>I'm drunk now, that's what it is.... And
aren't you drunk? And why isn't Mitya drinking? Why don't you
drink, Mitya? I'm drunk, and you don't drink....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am drunk! I'm drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and
now I'll be drunk with wine, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
He drank off another glass, and&mdash;he thought it strange himself&mdash;that
glass made him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although
till that moment he had been quite sober, he remembered
that. From that moment everything whirled about him, as though
he were delirious. He walked, laughed, talked to everybody, without
knowing what he was doing. Only one persistent burning sensation
made itself felt continually, <q>like a red-hot coal in his heart,</q> he
said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her, gazed at her,
listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept calling every
one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When
the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross
over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly
amused by the <q>little old man,</q> as she called Maximov. He ran up
every minute to kiss her hands, <q>each little finger,</q> and finally he
danced another dance to an old song, which he sang himself. He
danced with special vigor to the refrain:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The little pig says&mdash;umph! umph! umph!</l>
<l>The little calf says&mdash;moo, moo, moo,</l>
<l>The little duck says&mdash;quack, quack, quack,</l>
<l>The little goose says&mdash;ga, ga, ga.</l>
<l>The hen goes strutting through the porch;</l>
<l>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say,</l>
<l>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q>Give him something, Mitya,</q> said Grushenka. <q>Give him a
present, he's poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do
you know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one
day, Alyosha said something to me to-day that I shall remember
all my life.... Yes.... But to-day let us dance. To-morrow
<pb n='495'/><anchor id='Pg495'/>
to the nunnery, but to-day we'll dance. I want to play to-day, good
people, and what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God, I'd
forgive every one: <q>My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive
you.</q> I'm going to beg forgiveness: <q>Forgive me, good people, a silly
wench.</q> I'm a beast, that's what I am. But I want to pray. I gave
a little onion. Wicked as I've been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them
dance, don't stop them. Every one in the world is good. Every one&mdash;even
the worst of them. The world's a nice place. Though we're
bad the world's all right. We're good and bad, good and bad....
Come, tell me, I've something to ask you: come here every one, and
I'll ask you: Why am I so good? You know I am good. I'm very
good.... Come, why am I so good?</q>
</p>

<p>
So Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At
last she announced that she was going to dance, too. She got up
from her chair, staggering. <q>Mitya, don't give me any more wine&mdash;if
I ask you, don't give it to me. Wine doesn't give peace. Everything's
going round, the stove, and everything. I want to dance.
Let every one see how I dance ... let them see how beautifully I
dance....</q>
</p>

<p>
She really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out
of her pocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave
it in the dance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got
ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov,
hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and
ran skipping about in front of her, humming:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>With legs so slim and sides so trim</l>
<l>And its little tail curled tight.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him
away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Sh-h! Mitya, why don't they come? Let every one come ...
to look on. Call them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did
you lock them in? Tell them I'm going to dance. Let them look
on, too....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and
began knocking to the Poles with his fist.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she's going to dance. She
calls you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='496'/><anchor id='Pg496'/>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Lajdak!</foreign></q> one of the Poles shouted in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a <foreign rend='italic'>lajdak</foreign>
yourself! You're a little scoundrel, that's what
you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave off laughing at Poland,</q> said Kalganov sententiously. He
too was drunk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn't mean that
I called all Poland so. One <foreign rend='italic'>lajdak</foreign>
doesn't make a Poland. Be quiet,
my pretty boy, eat a sweetmeat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why won't
they make friends?</q> said Grushenka, and went forward to dance.
The chorus broke into <q>Ah, my porch, my new porch!</q> Grushenka
flung back her head, half opened her lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief,
and suddenly, with a violent lurch, stood still in the middle
of the room, looking bewildered.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm weak....</q> she said in an exhausted voice. <q>Forgive me....
I'm weak, I can't.... I'm sorry.</q>
</p>

<p>
She bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry.... Forgive me....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The lady's been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,</q>
voices were heard saying.
</p>

<p>
<q>The lady's drunk too much,</q> Maximov explained to the girls,
giggling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, lead me away ... take me,</q> said Grushenka helplessly.
Mitya pounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the
precious burden through the curtains.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now I'll go,</q> thought Kalganov, and walking out of the
blue room, he closed the two halves of the door after him. But the
orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya
laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't touch me....</q> she faltered, in an imploring voice.
<q>Don't touch me, till I'm yours.... I've told you I'm yours, but
don't touch me ... spare me.... With them here, with them
close, you mustn't. He's here. It's nasty here....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll obey you! I won't think of it ... I worship you!</q> muttered
Mitya. <q>Yes, it's nasty here, it's abominable.</q>
</p>

<p>
And still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, though you're a brute, you're generous,</q> Grushenka
<pb n='497'/><anchor id='Pg497'/>
articulated with difficulty. <q>It must be honorable ... it shall be
honorable for the future ... and let us be honest, let us be good,
not brutes, but good ... take me away, take me far away, do you
hear? I don't want it to be here, but far, far away....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, yes, it must be!</q> said Mitya, pressing her in his arms.
<q>I'll take you and we'll fly away.... Oh, I'd give my whole life
for one year only to know about that blood!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What blood?</q> asked Grushenka, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing,</q> muttered Mitya, through his teeth. <q>Grusha, you
wanted to be honest, but I'm a thief. But I've stolen money from
Katya.... Disgrace, a disgrace!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn't steal it.
Give it her back, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now
everything of mine is yours. What does money matter? We shall
waste it anyway.... Folks like us are bound to waste money.
But we'd better go and work the land. I want to dig the earth with
my own hands. We must work, do you hear? Alyosha said so. I
won't be your mistress, I'll be faithful to you, I'll be your slave,
I'll work for you. We'll go to the young lady and bow down to
her together, so that she may forgive us, and then we'll go away.
And if she won't forgive us, we'll go, anyway. Take her her money
and love me.... Don't love her.... Don't love her any more.
If you love her, I shall strangle her.... I'll put out both her eyes
with a needle....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I love you. I love only you. I'll love you in Siberia....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don't care ...
we'll work ... there's snow in Siberia.... I love driving
in the snow ... and must have bells.... Do you hear, there's a
bell ringing? Where is that bell ringing? There are people coming....
Now it's stopped.</q>
</p>

<p>
She closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an
instant. There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance,
but the ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast.
He did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice
that the songs had ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken
clamor there was absolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... I've
<pb n='498'/><anchor id='Pg498'/>
been asleep and dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and
I dozed. I was with some one I loved, with you. And far, far away.
I was holding you and kissing you, nestling close to you. I was
cold, and the snow glistened.... You know how the snow glistens
at night when the moon shines. It was as though I was not on
earth. I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. How sweet that
is!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Close to you,</q> murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom,
her hands. And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him
that she was looking straight before her, not at him, not into his
face, but over his head, with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An
expression of wonder, almost of alarm, came suddenly into her face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, who is that looking at us?</q> she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Mitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains
and seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone,
it seemed.
</p>

<p>
He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here, come to us, come here,</q> said a voice, speaking not loudly,
but firmly and peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still.
The room was filled with people, but not those who had been there
before. An instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered.
He recognized all those people instantly. That tall, stout
old man in the overcoat and forage-cap with a cockade&mdash;was the
police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And that <q>consumptive-looking</q>
trim dandy, <q>who always has such polished boots</q>&mdash;that was
the deputy prosecutor. <q>He has a chronometer worth four hundred
roubles; he showed it to me.</q> And that small young man in spectacles....
Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had
seen him: he was the <q>investigating lawyer,</q> from the <q>school of
jurisprudence,</q> who had only lately come to the town. And this
man&mdash;the inspector of police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he
knew well. And those fellows with the brass plates on, why are they
here? And those other two ... peasants.... And there at the
door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen! What's this for, gentlemen?</q> began Mitya, but
suddenly, as though beside himself, not knowing what he was doing,
he cried aloud, at the top of his voice:
</p>

<pb n='499'/><anchor id='Pg499'/>

<p>
<q>I un&mdash;der&mdash;stand!</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping
up to Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:
</p>

<p>
<q>We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this
way to the sofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should
give an explanation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The old man!</q> cried Mitya frantically. <q>The old man and his
blood!... I understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had
been mown down by a scythe.
</p>

<p>
<q>You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide!
Your father's blood cries out against you!</q> the old captain of police
roared suddenly, stepping up to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
He was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is impossible!</q> cried the small young man. <q>Mihail Makarovitch,
Mihail Makarovitch, this won't do!... I beg you'll allow
me to speak. I should never have expected such behavior from
you....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,</q> cried the captain
of police; <q>look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company
of a disreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his
hands.... It's delirium!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain
your feelings,</q> the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old
police captain, <q>or I shall be forced to resort to&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
But the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to
Mitya, and delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that
you are charged with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Karamazov, perpetrated this night....</q>
</p>

<p>
He said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something,
but though Mitya heard them he did not understand them.
He stared at them all with wild eyes.

<head>Book IX. The Preliminary Investigation</head>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter I. The Beginning Of Perhotin's Official Career</head>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the
strong locked gates of the widow Morozov's house, ended, of
course, by making himself heard. Fenya, who was still excited by
the fright she had had two hours before, and too much <q>upset</q> to
go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the
furious knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen him
drive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking
again, no one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the
house-porter, who had already waked up and gone out to the gate,
and began imploring him not to open it. But having questioned
Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he wanted to see Fenya on very
<q>important business,</q> the man made up his mind at last to open.
Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya's kitchen, but the girl begged
him to allow the house-porter to be present, <q>because of her misgivings.</q>
He began questioning her and at once learnt the most
vital fact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to
look for Grushenka, he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar,
and that when he returned, the pestle was not with him and his
hands were smeared with blood.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!</q>
Fenya kept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the
product of her disordered imagination. But although not <q>dripping,</q>
Pyotr Ilyitch had himself seen those hands stained with blood,
and had helped to wash them. Moreover, the question he had to
decide was not how soon the blood had dried, but where Dmitri
Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather, whether it really
<pb n='501'/><anchor id='Pg501'/>
was to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, and how he could satisfactorily ascertain.
Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this point, and though
he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away a conviction
that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his
father's house, and that therefore something must have happened
there.
</p>

<p>
<q>And when he came back,</q> Fenya added with excitement,
<q>I told him the whole story, and then I began asking him, <q>Why
have you got blood on your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q> and he
answered that that was human blood, and that he had just killed
some one. He confessed it all to me, and suddenly ran off like a
madman. I sat down and began thinking, where's he run off to
now like a madman? He'll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my
mistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was running
to his lodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov's shop, and saw him just
setting off, and there was no blood on his hands then.</q> (Fenya had
noticed this and remembered it.) Fenya's old grandmother confirmed
her evidence as far as she was capable. After asking some
further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch left the house, even more upset
and uneasy than he had been when he entered it.
</p>

<p>
The most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have
been to go straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, to find out whether anything
had happened there, and if so, what; and only to go to the
police captain, as Pyotr Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he had
satisfied himself of the fact. But the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch's
gates were strong, and he would have to knock again. His
acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of the slightest, and what
if, after he had been knocking, they opened to him, and nothing
had happened? Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way would
go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called
Perhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one
had killed him. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what
Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded more than anything in the world.
</p>

<p>
Yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he
stamped his foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not
to Fyodor Pavlovitch's but to Madame Hohlakov's. He decided
that if she denied having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand
roubles, he would go straight to the police captain, but if she
<pb n='502'/><anchor id='Pg502'/>
admitted having given him the money, he would go home and let
the matter rest till next morning.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood
of causing scandal by going at eleven o'clock at night to a
fashionable lady, a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from
her bed to ask her an amazing question, than by going to Fyodor
Pavlovitch. But that is just how it is, sometimes, especially in cases
like the present one, with the decisions of the most precise and
phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was by no means phlegmatic at
that moment. He remembered all his life how a haunting uneasiness
gradually gained possession of him, growing more and more painful
and driving him on, against his will. Yet he kept cursing himself,
of course, all the way for going to this lady, but <q>I will get to the
bottom of it, I will!</q> he repeated for the tenth time, grinding his
teeth, and he carried out his intention.
</p>

<p>
It was exactly eleven o'clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov's
house. He was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response
to his inquiry whether the lady was still up, the porter could
give no answer, except that she was usually in bed by that time.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you,
she'll receive you. If she won't, she won't.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The
footman was unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid.
Pyotr Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady
that an official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on
particular business, and that if it were not of the greatest importance
he would not have ventured to come. <q>Tell her in those words, in
those words exactly,</q> he asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
She went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame
Hohlakov herself was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep.
She had felt upset ever since Mitya's visit, and had a presentiment
that she would not get through the night without the sick headache
which always, with her, followed such excitement. She was surprised
on hearing the announcement from the maid. She irritably
declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit at such
an hour, of an <q>official living in the town,</q> who was a total stranger,
roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr Ilyitch
<pb n='503'/><anchor id='Pg503'/>
was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to
take another message in these very words:
</p>

<p>
<q>That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and
that Madame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she
refused to see him now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I plunged headlong,</q> he described it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message
again. Madame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little,
asked what he looked like, and learned that he was <q>very well
dressed, young and so polite.</q> We may note, parenthetically, that
Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking young man, and well aware
of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him. She
was in her dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a black shawl
over her shoulders. <q>The official</q> was asked to walk into the
drawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received
shortly before. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly
inquiring countenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began
at once with the question:
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning
our common acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,</q> Perhotin
began.
</p>

<p>
But he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady's face showed
signs of acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him
in a fury:
</p>

<p>
<q>How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?</q> she
cried hysterically. <q>How dare you, sir, how could you venture to
disturb a lady who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an
hour!... And to force yourself upon her to talk of a man who
came here, to this very drawing-room, only three hours ago, to
murder me, and went stamping out of the room, as no one would
go out of a decent house. Let me tell you, sir, that I shall lodge
a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass. Kindly leave me
at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, has he killed somebody else?</q> Madame Hohlakov asked
impulsively.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I'll explain
<pb n='504'/><anchor id='Pg504'/>
it all in a couple of words,</q> answered Perhotin, firmly. <q>At
five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles
from me, and I know for a fact he had no money. Yet at nine
o'clock, he came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes
in his hand, about two or three thousand roubles. His hands and
face were all covered with blood, and he looked like a madman.
When I asked him where he had got so much money, he answered
that he had just received it from you, that you had given him a sum
of three thousand to go to the gold-mines....</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov's face assumed an expression of intense and
painful excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good God! He must have killed his old father!</q> she cried,
clasping her hands. <q>I have never given him money, never! Oh,
run, run!... Don't say another word! Save the old man ... run
to his father ... run!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You
remember for a fact that you did not give him any money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't, I didn't! I refused to give it him, for he could not
appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me,
but I slipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide
nothing from you now, that he positively spat at me. Can you
fancy that! But why are we standing? Ah, sit down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, I....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man
from an awful death!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if he has killed him already?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What
do you think we must do now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Meantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself,
facing him. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her
the history of the affair, that part of it at least which he had himself
witnessed. He described, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her
about the pestle. All these details produced an overwhelming effect
on the distracted lady, who kept uttering shrieks, and covering her
face with her hands....
</p>

<p>
<q>Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special
faculty, whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I've
looked at that awful man and always thought, that man will end by
<pb n='505'/><anchor id='Pg505'/>
murdering me. And now it's happened ... that is, if he hasn't
murdered me, but only his own father, it's only because the finger
of God preserved me, and what's more, he was ashamed to murder
me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon from the relics
of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck.... And to think
how near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him
and he stretched out his neck to me!... Do you know, Pyotr
Ilyitch (I think you said your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don't
believe in miracles, but that ikon and this unmistakable miracle with
me now&mdash;that shakes me, and I'm ready to believe in anything you
like. Have you heard about Father Zossima?... But I don't
know what I'm saying ... and only fancy, with the ikon on his
neck he spat at me.... He only spat, it's true, he didn't murder
me and ... he dashed away! But what shall we do, what must we
do now? What do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight
to the police captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do
what he thought fit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, he's an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I
know him. Of course, he's the person to go to. How practical
you are, Pyotr Ilyitch! How well you've thought of everything!
I should never have thought of it in your place!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,</q> observed
Pyotr Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously
anxious to escape as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady,
who would not let him say good-by and go away.
</p>

<p>
<q>And be sure, be sure,</q> she prattled on, <q>to come back and tell
me what you see there, and what you find out ... what comes to
light ... how they'll try him ... and what he's condemned to....
Tell me, we have no capital punishment, have we? But be
sure to come, even if it's at three o'clock at night, at four, at half-past
four.... Tell them to wake me, to wake me, to shake me,
if I don't get up.... But, good heavens, I shan't sleep! But wait,
hadn't I better come with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>N&mdash;no. But if you would write three lines with your own
hand, stating that you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it
might, perhaps, be of use ... in case it's needed....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure!</q> Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her
<pb n='506'/><anchor id='Pg506'/>
bureau. <q>And you know I'm simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness,
your good sense in such affairs. Are you in the service
here? I'm delighted to think that you're in the service here!</q>
</p>

<p>
And still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the
following lines:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
I've never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy), three thousand
roubles to-day. I've never given him money, never: That I
swear by all that's holy!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>K. Hohlakov.</hi>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
<q>Here's the note!</q> she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>Go,
save him. It's a noble deed on your part!</q>
</p>

<p>
And she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She
ran out to accompany him to the passage.
</p>

<p>
<q>How grateful I am to you! You can't think how grateful I
am to you for having come to me, first. How is it I haven't met
you before? I shall feel flattered at seeing you at my house in
the future. How delightful it is that you are living here!...
Such precision! Such practical ability!... They must appreciate
you, they must understand you. If there's anything I can do,
believe me ... oh, I love young people! I'm in love with young
people! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering
country. Her one hope.... Oh, go, go!...</q>
</p>

<p>
But Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have
let him go so soon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable
impression on him, which had somewhat softened his anxiety
at being drawn into such an unpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we
all know. <q>She's by no means so elderly,</q> he thought, feeling
pleased, <q>on the contrary I should have taken her for her daughter.</q>
</p>

<p>
As for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young
man. <q>Such sense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day!
and all that with such manners and appearance! People say the
young people of to-day are no good for anything, but here's an
example!</q> etc. So she simply forgot this <q>dreadful affair,</q> and it
was only as she was getting into bed, that, suddenly recalling <q>how
near death she had been,</q> she exclaimed: <q>Ah, it is awful, awful!</q>
</p>

<p>
But she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.
</p>

<pb n='507'/><anchor id='Pg507'/>

<p>
I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant
details, if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by
no means elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the
foundation of the whole career of that practical and precise young
man. His story is remembered to this day with amazement in our
town, and I shall perhaps have something to say about it, when I
have finished my long history of the Brothers Karamazov.

<head>Chapter II. The Alarm</head>

<p>
Our police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired
lieutenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He
had only come to us three years previously, but had won general
esteem, chiefly because he <q>knew how to keep society together.</q>
He was never without visitors, and could not have got on without
them. Some one or other was always dining with him; he never sat
down to table without guests. He gave regular dinners, too, on
all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones. Though the
fare was not <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>recherché</foreign>,
it was abundant. The fish-pies were excellent,
and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.
</p>

<p>
The first room his guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room,
with pictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls,
an essential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor's billiard-room.
There was card-playing every evening at his house, if only
at one table. But at frequent intervals, all the society of our town,
with the mammas and young ladies, assembled at his house to dance.
Though Mihail Makarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone.
His widowed daughter lived with him, with her two unmarried
daughters, grown-up girls, who had finished their education. They
were of agreeable appearance and lively character, and though every
one knew they would have no dowry, they attracted all the young
men of fashion to their grandfather's house.
</p>

<p>
Mihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work,
though he performed his duties no worse than many others. To
speak plainly, he was a man of rather narrow education. His understanding
<pb n='508'/><anchor id='Pg508'/>
of the limits of his administrative power could not always
be relied upon. It was not so much that he failed to grasp certain
reforms enacted during the present reign, as that he made conspicuous
blunders in his interpretation of them. This was not from
any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for he was
always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,</q> he used
to say of himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the
fundamental principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation
of the serfs, and only picked it up, so to speak, from year to
year, involuntarily increasing his knowledge by practice. And yet
he was himself a landowner. Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that
he would meet some of Mihail Makarovitch's visitors there that
evening, but he didn't know which. As it happened, at that moment
the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district doctor, a young
man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg after taking a
brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist
at the police captain's. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was
really the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the prosecutor),
was rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined
to be consumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman. He
was vain and irritable, though he had a good intellect, and even a
kind heart. It seemed that all that was wrong with him was that
he had a better opinion of himself than his ability warranted. And
that made him seem constantly uneasy. He had, moreover, certain
higher, even artistic, leanings, towards psychology, for instance, a
special study of the human heart, a special knowledge of the criminal
and his crime. He cherished a grievance on this ground, considering
that he had been passed over in the service, and being firmly persuaded
that in higher spheres he had not been properly appreciated,
and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to give
up his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected
Karamazov case agitated him profoundly: <q>It was a case
that might well be talked about all over Russia.</q> But I am anticipating.
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer,
who had only come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting
in the next room with the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards
<pb n='509'/><anchor id='Pg509'/>
and wondered that all the gentlemen should, as though intentionally,
on the evening of <q>the crime</q> have been gathered together
at the house of the executive authority. Yet it was perfectly simple
and happened quite naturally.
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch's wife had had toothache for the last two days,
and he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor,
from the very nature of his being, could not spend an evening except
at cards. Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for
three days past to drop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch's, so
to speak casually, so as slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter,
Olga Mihailovna, by showing that he knew her secret, that he knew
it was her birthday, and that she was trying to conceal it on purpose,
so as not to be obliged to give a dance. He anticipated a great deal
of merriment, many playful jests about her age, and her being afraid
to reveal it, about his knowing her secret and telling everybody, and
so on. The charming young man was a great adept at such teasing;
the ladies had christened him <q>the naughty man,</q> and he seemed to
be delighted at the name. He was extremely well-bred, however, of
good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life
of pleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He
was short, and delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers
he always wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was
engaged in his official duties, he always became extraordinarily grave,
as though realizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations
laid upon him. He had a special gift for mystifying murderers and
other criminals of the peasant class during interrogation, and if he
did not win their respect, he certainly succeeded in arousing their
wonder.
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the
police captain's. He saw instantly that every one knew. They
had positively thrown down their cards, all were standing up and
talking. Even Nikolay Parfenovitch had left the young ladies and
run in, looking strenuous and ready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was
met with the astounding news that old Fyodor Pavlovitch really had
been murdered that evening in his own house, murdered and robbed.
The news had only just reached them in the following manner.
</p>

<p>
Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked
senseless near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might
<pb n='510'/><anchor id='Pg510'/>
well have slept till morning after the draught she had taken. But,
all of a sudden she waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic
scream from Smerdyakov, who was lying in the next room unconscious.
That scream always preceded his fits, and always terrified
and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could never get accustomed to it.
She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov's room. But it
was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid beginning to
gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out
and was going to call her husband, but suddenly realized that when
she had got up, he was not beside her in bed. She ran back to the
bedstead and began groping with her hands, but the bed was really
empty. Then he must have gone out&mdash;where? She ran to the steps
and timidly called him. She got no answer, of course, but she caught
the sound of groans far away in the garden in the darkness. She
listened. The groans were repeated, and it was evident they came
from the garden.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!</q>
she thought distractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw
that the gate into the garden was open.
</p>

<p>
<q>He must be out there, poor dear,</q> she thought. She went up
to the gate and all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her
by name, <q>Marfa! Marfa!</q> in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lord, preserve us from harm!</q> Marfa Ignatyevna murmured,
and ran towards the voice, and that was how she found Grigory.
But she found him not by the fence where he had been knocked
down, but about twenty paces off. It appeared later, that he had
crawled away on coming to himself, and probably had been a long
time getting so far, losing consciousness several times. She noticed
at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed at the top
of her voice. Grigory was muttering incoherently:
</p>

<p>
<q>He has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream,
silly ... run ... fetch some one....</q>
</p>

<p>
But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master's
window was open and that there was a candle alight in the window,
she ran there and began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in
at the window, she saw a fearful sight. Her master was lying on
his back, motionless, on the floor. His light-colored dressing-gown
and white shirt were soaked with blood. The candle on the table
<pb n='511'/><anchor id='Pg511'/>
brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless dead face of Fyodor
Pavlovitch. Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from the window,
ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran headlong
by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna. Both
mother and daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa's
desperate and persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter.
Marfa, shrieking and screaming incoherently, managed to tell them
the main fact, and to beg for assistance. It happened that Foma
had come back from his wanderings and was staying the night with
them. They got him up immediately and all three ran to the scene
of the crime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered that
at about eight o'clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden,
and this was no doubt Grigory's scream, <q>Parricide!</q> uttered when
he caught hold of Mitya's leg.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some one person screamed out and then was silent,</q> Marya
Kondratyevna explained as she ran. Running to the place where
Grigory lay, the two women with the help of Foma carried him to
the lodge. They lighted a candle and saw that Smerdyakov was no
better, that he was writhing in convulsions, his eyes fixed in a
squint, and that foam was flowing from his lips. They moistened
Grigory's forehead with water mixed with vinegar, and the water
revived him at once. He asked immediately:
</p>

<p>
<q>Is the master murdered?</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this
time that not only the window, but also the door into the garden
was wide open, though Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week
locked himself in every night and did not allow even Grigory to
come in on any pretext. Seeing that door open, they were afraid to
go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch <q>for fear anything should happen afterwards.</q>
And when they returned to Grigory, the old man told
them to go straight to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ran
there and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain's.
She arrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story
came, not as his own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation,
by a witness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the
criminal (a theory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe
till that moment).
</p>

<p>
It was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector
<pb n='512'/><anchor id='Pg512'/>
of the town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter
Fyodor Pavlovitch's house and there to open an inquiry on the spot,
according to the regular forms, which I will not go into here. The
district doctor, a zealous man, new to his work, almost insisted on
accompanying the police captain, the prosecutor, and the investigating
lawyer.
</p>

<p>
I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite
dead, with his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with
the same weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And
immediately that weapon was found, Grigory, to whom all possible
medical assistance was at once given, described in a weak and breaking
voice how he had been knocked down. They began looking
with a lantern by the fence and found the brass pestle dropped in
a most conspicuous place on the garden path. There were no signs
of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying.
But by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a
big and thick envelope with the inscription: <q>A present of three
thousand roubles for my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.</q>
And below had been added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>For my little
chicken.</q> There were three seals of red sealing-wax on the envelope,
but it had been torn open and was empty: the money had been removed.
They found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon,
with which the envelope had been tied up.
</p>

<p>
One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch's evidence made a great impression on
the prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea
that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak,
that he had resolved to do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken
the pistols, loaded them before him, written a letter, put it in his
pocket, etc. When Pyotr Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe
in it, threatened to tell some one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya
had answered grinning: <q>You'll be too late.</q> So they must make
haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before he really did shoot
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's clear, that's clear!</q> repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.
<q>That's just the way with mad fellows like that: <q>I shall
kill myself to-morrow, so I'll make merry till I die!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited
the prosecutor more than ever.
</p>

<pb n='513'/><anchor id='Pg513'/>

<p>
<q>Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called
Olsufyev, gentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to
have his hair curled, and then, without even hiding the money,
carrying it almost in his hand in the same way, he went off to the
girls.</q>
</p>

<p>
All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the
formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took
time and so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe
the officer of the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov,
who had arrived in the town the morning before to get his pay.
He was instructed to avoid raising the alarm when he reached
Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the <q>criminal</q> till the
arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also witnesses for the
arrest, police constables, and so on. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch did as
he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no one but his
old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of his secret
business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the landlord
in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at once a
change in Trifon Borissovitch's face and voice. So neither Mitya
nor any one else knew that he was being watched. The box with
the pistols had been carried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in
a suitable place. Only after four o'clock, almost at sunrise, all the
officials, the police captain, the prosecutor, the investigating lawyer,
drove up in two carriages, each drawn by three horses. The doctor
remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch's to make a post-mortem next day
on the body. But he was particularly interested in the condition
of the servant, Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually
for twenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest
to science,</q> he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as
they left they laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor
and the investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor's
saying that Smerdyakov could not outlive the night.
</p>

<p>
After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will
return to that moment of our tale at which we broke off.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter III. The Sufferings Of A Soul, The First Ordeal</head>

<p>
And so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not
understanding what was said to him. Suddenly he got up,
flung up his hands, and shouted aloud:
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty of that blood! I'm not guilty
of my father's blood.... I meant to kill him. But I'm not guilty.
Not I.</q>
</p>

<p>
But he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind
the curtain and flung herself at the police captain's feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!</q> she cried, in a heartrending
voice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands
towards them. <q>He did it through me. I tortured him and drove
him to it. I tortured that poor old man that's dead, too, in my
wickedness, and brought him to this! It's my fault, mine first, mine
most, my fault!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it's your fault! You're the chief criminal! You fury!
You harlot! You're the most to blame!</q> shouted the police captain,
threatening her with his hand. But he was quickly and resolutely
suppressed. The prosecutor positively seized hold of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch!</q> he cried.
<q>You are positively hindering the inquiry.... You're ruining the
case....</q> he almost gasped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Follow the regular course! Follow the regular course!</q> cried
Nikolay Parfenovitch, fearfully excited too, <q>otherwise it's absolutely
impossible!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Judge us together!</q> Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling.
<q>Punish us together. I will go with him now, if it's to death!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!</q> Mitya fell on his
knees beside her and held her tight in his arms. <q>Don't believe
her,</q> he cried, <q>she's not guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!</q>
</p>

<p>
He remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away
from her by several men, and that she was led out, and that when
he recovered himself he was sitting at the table. Beside him and
<pb n='515'/><anchor id='Pg515'/>
behind him stood the men with metal plates. Facing him on the
other side of the table sat Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating
lawyer. He kept persuading him to drink a little water out of a
glass that stood on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don't be
frightened,</q> he added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered
it afterwards) became suddenly intensely interested in his big rings,
one with an amethyst, and another with a transparent bright yellow
stone, of great brilliance. And long afterwards he remembered with
wonder how those rings had riveted his attention through all those
terrible hours of interrogation, so that he was utterly unable to
tear himself away from them and dismiss them, as things that had
nothing to do with his position. On Mitya's left side, in the place
where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening,
the prosecutor was now seated, and on Mitya's right hand, where
Grushenka had been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of
shabby hunting-jacket, with ink and paper before him. This was
the secretary of the investigating lawyer, who had brought him
with him. The police captain was now standing by the window at
the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was sitting there.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drink some water,</q> said the investigating lawyer softly, for the
tenth time.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen,
crush me, punish me, decide my fate!</q> cried Mitya, staring
with terribly fixed wide-open eyes at the investigating lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of
your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch?</q> asked the investigating lawyer,
softly but insistently.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man
but not of my father's. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the
old man and knocked him down.... But it's hard to have to
answer for that murder with another, a terrible murder of which
I am not guilty.... It's a terrible accusation, gentlemen, a knock-down
blow. But who has killed my father, who has killed him?
Who can have killed him if I didn't? It's marvelous, extraordinary,
impossible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, who can have killed him?</q> the investigating lawyer was
<pb n='516'/><anchor id='Pg516'/>
beginning, but Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him,
addressed Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory
Vassilyevitch. He is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the terrible
blows inflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by
you, there seems no doubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at
least.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alive? He's alive?</q> cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His
face beamed. <q>Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought
for me, a sinner and evildoer. That's an answer to my prayer.
I've been praying all night.</q> And he crossed himself three times.
He was almost breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence
concerning you, that&mdash;</q> The prosecutor would have continued,
but Mitya suddenly jumped up from his chair.
</p>

<p>
<q>One minute, gentlemen, for God's sake, one minute; I will run
to her&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, at this moment it's quite impossible,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
almost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was
seized by the men with the metal plates, but he sat down of his
own accord....
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute
only; I wanted to tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone,
that blood that was weighing on my heart all night, and that I am
not a murderer now! Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!</q> he said
ecstatically and reverently, looking round at them all. <q>Oh, thank
you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute you have given me new life,
new heart!... That old man used to carry me in his arms, gentlemen.
He used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three years
old, abandoned by every one, he was like a father to me!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And so you&mdash;</q> the investigating lawyer began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,</q> interposed
Mitya, putting his elbows on the table and covering his face with
his hands. <q>Let me have a moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen.
All this is horribly upsetting, horribly. A man is not a
drum, gentlemen!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Drink a little more water,</q> murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
</p>

<p>
Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were
<pb n='517'/><anchor id='Pg517'/>
confident. He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His
whole bearing was changed; he was once more the equal of these
men, with all of whom he was acquainted, as though they had all
met the day before, when nothing had happened, at some social
gathering. We may note in passing that, on his first arrival, Mitya
had been made very welcome at the police captain's, but later, during
the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called at all, and when
the police captain met him, in the street, for instance, Mitya noticed
that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His acquaintance
with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes paid
his wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without
quite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had,
for some reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had not
had time to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had
met him and talked to him twice, each time about the fair sex.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,</q> cried
Mitya, laughing gayly, <q>but I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen,
I feel like a new man, and don't be offended at my addressing you so
simply and directly. I'm rather drunk, too, I'll tell you that frankly.
I believe I've had the honor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay
Parfenovitch, at my kinsman Miüsov's. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I
don't pretend to be on equal terms with you. I understand, of
course, in what character I am sitting before you. Oh, of course,
there's a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... if Grigory
has given evidence.... A horrible suspicion! It's awful, awful, I
understand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we
will make an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen!
Since I know I'm innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute.
Can't we? Can't we?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though
he positively took his listeners to be his best friends.
</p>

<p>
<q>So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the
charge brought against you,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively,
and bending down to the secretary he dictated to him in an
undertone what to write.
</p>

<p>
<q>Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it;
I consent, I give my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay,
stay, write this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of
<pb n='518'/><anchor id='Pg518'/>
violence on a poor old man I am guilty. And there is something
else at the bottom of my heart, of which I am guilty, too&mdash;but that
you need not write down</q> (he turned suddenly to the secretary);
<q>that's my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn't concern you, the
bottom of my heart, that's to say.... But of the murder of my
old father I'm not guilty. That's a wild idea. It's quite a wild
idea!... I will prove you that and you'll be convinced directly....
You will laugh, gentlemen. You'll laugh yourselves at your
suspicion!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> said the investigating lawyer
evidently trying to allay Mitya's excitement by his own composure.
<q>Before we go on with our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent
to answer, to hear you confirm the statement that you disliked
your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, that you were involved in continual
disputes with him. Here at least, a quarter of an hour ago,
you exclaimed that you wanted to kill him: <q>I didn't kill him,</q> you
said, <q>but I wanted to kill him.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily,
I did want to kill him ... many times I wanted to ...
unhappily, unhappily!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives
precisely led you to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is there to explain, gentlemen?</q> Mitya shrugged his
shoulders sullenly, looking down. <q>I have never concealed my
feelings. All the town knows about it&mdash;every one knows in the
tavern. Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima's cell....
And the very same day, in the evening I beat my father. I nearly
killed him, and I swore I'd come again and kill him, before witnesses....
Oh, a thousand witnesses! I've been shouting it aloud
for the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares
you in the face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings,
gentlemen, feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen</q>&mdash;Mitya
frowned&mdash;<q>it seems to me that about feelings you've no
right to question me. I know that you are bound by your office, I
quite understand that, but that's my affair, my private, intimate
affair, yet ... since I haven't concealed my feelings in the past ...
in the tavern, for instance, I've talked to every one, so ...
so I won't make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,
<pb n='519'/><anchor id='Pg519'/>
that there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told
every one that I'd kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he's been killed.
So it must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you,
gentlemen, I can quite make allowances. I'm struck all of a heap
myself, for who can have murdered him, if not I? That's what it
comes to, isn't it? If not I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I
want to know, I insist on knowing!</q> he exclaimed suddenly. <q>Where
was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, and with what?
Tell me,</q> he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.
</p>

<p>
<q>We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with
his head battered in,</q> said the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's horrible!</q> Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on
the table, hid his face in his right hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>We will continue,</q> interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. <q>So what
was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have
asserted in public, I believe, that it was based upon jealousy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Disputes about money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, about money, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which
you claimed as part of your inheritance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand! More, more,</q> cried Mitya hotly; <q>more than
six thousand, more than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it
at them. But I made up my mind to let it go at three thousand.
I was desperately in need of that three thousand ... so the bundle
of notes for three thousand that I knew he kept under his pillow,
ready for Grushenka, I considered as simply stolen from me. Yes,
gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my own property....</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer,
and had time to wink at him on the sly.
</p>

<p>
<q>We will return to that subject later,</q> said the lawyer promptly.
<q>You will allow us to note that point and write it down; that you
looked upon that money as your own property?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Write it down, by all means. I know that's another fact that
tells against me, but I'm not afraid of facts and I tell them against
myself. Do you hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for
a different sort of man from what I am,</q> he added, suddenly gloomy
and dejected. <q>You have to deal with a man of honor, a man of
<pb n='520'/><anchor id='Pg520'/>
the highest honor; above all&mdash;don't lose sight of it&mdash;a man who's
done a lot of nasty things, but has always been, and still is, honorable
at bottom, in his inner being. I don't know how to express it.
That's just what's made me wretched all my life, that I yearned to
be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense of honor,
seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, and yet
all my life I've been doing filthy things like all of us, gentlemen ...
that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me
alone!... Gentlemen, my head aches ...</q> His brows contracted
with pain. <q>You see, gentlemen, I couldn't bear the look
of him, there was something in him ignoble, impudent, trampling on
everything sacred, something sneering and irreverent, loathsome,
loathsome. But now that he's dead, I feel differently.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't feel differently, but I wish I hadn't hated him so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You feel penitent?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not penitent, don't write that. I'm not much good myself,
I'm not very beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive.
That's what I mean. Write that down, if you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more
and more gloomy as the inquiry continued.
</p>

<p>
At that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though
Grushenka had been removed, she had not been taken far away,
only into the room next but one from the blue room, in which the
examination was proceeding. It was a little room with one window,
next beyond the large room in which they had danced and feasted
so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by her but Maximov,
who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her
side, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants
with a metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly
her grief was too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her
arms and, with a loud wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to
him, to her Mitya, and so unexpectedly that they had not time
to stop her. Mitya, hearing her cry, trembled, jumped up, and
with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her, not knowing what he
was doing. But they were not allowed to come together, though
they saw one another. He was seized by the arms. He struggled,
and tried to tear himself away. It took three or four men to hold
<pb n='521'/><anchor id='Pg521'/>
him. She was seized too, and he saw her stretching out her arms
to him, crying aloud as they carried her away. When the scene
was over, he came to himself again, sitting in the same place as
before, opposite the investigating lawyer, and crying out to them:
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want with her? Why do you torment her? She's
done nothing, nothing!...</q>
</p>

<p>
The lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like
this. At last Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly
into the room, and said in a loud and excited voice to the
prosecutor:
</p>

<p>
<q>She's been removed, she's downstairs. Will you allow me to say
one word to this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen,
in your presence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,</q> answered the investigating
lawyer. <q>In the present case we have nothing against it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,</q> began the police
captain, and there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for
the luckless prisoner on his excited face. <q>I took your Agrafena
Alexandrovna downstairs myself, and confided her to the care of
the landlord's daughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her
all the time. And I soothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed
her. I impressed on her that you have to clear yourself, so she
mustn't hinder you, must not depress you, or you may lose your
head and say the wrong thing in your evidence. In fact, I talked to
her and she understood. She's a sensible girl, my boy, a good-hearted
girl, she would have kissed my old hands, begging help for
you. She sent me herself, to tell you not to worry about her. And
I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her that you are calm
and comforted about her. And so you must be calm, do you understand?
I was unfair to her; she is a Christian soul, gentlemen,
yes, I tell you, she's a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything. So
what am I to tell her, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet
or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
The good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular,
but Grushenka's suffering, a fellow creature's suffering, touched
his good-natured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped
up and rushed towards him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!</q> he cried.
<pb n='522'/><anchor id='Pg522'/>
<q>You've the heart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank
you for her. I will, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in
the kindness of your heart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that
I shall be laughing in a minute, knowing that she has a guardian
angel like you. I shall have done with all this directly, and as soon
as I'm free, I'll be with her, she'll see, let her wait. Gentlemen,</q> he
said, turning to the two lawyers, <q>now I'll open my whole soul to
you; I'll pour out everything. We'll finish this off directly, finish
it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end, shan't we? But, gentlemen,
that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me tell you
that. That one thing I'll tell you now.... I see I'm with honorable
men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you
knew! Did you hear her cry, <q>I'll go to death with you</q>? And
what have I, a penniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for
me? How can a clumsy, ugly brute like me, with my ugly face,
deserve such love, that she is ready to go to exile with me? And
how she fell down at your feet for my sake, just now!... and
yet she's proud and has done nothing! How can I help adoring her,
how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I did just now?
Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his
hands, burst into tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered
himself instantly. The old police captain seemed much pleased,
and the lawyers also. They felt that the examination was passing
into a new phase. When the police captain went out, Mitya was
positively gay.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal.
And if it were not for all these trivial details, we should understand
one another in a minute. I'm at those details again. I'm at
your disposal, gentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual
confidence, you in me and I in you, or there'll be no end to it. I
speak in your interests. To business, gentlemen, to business, and
don't rummage in my soul; don't tease me with trifles, but only ask
me about facts and what matters, and I will satisfy you at once.
And damn the details!</q>
</p>

<p>
So spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again.

<head>Chapter IV. The Second Ordeal</head>

<p>
<q>You don't know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
by your readiness to answer,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch,
with an animated air, and obvious satisfaction beaming in his very
prominent, short-sighted, light gray eyes, from which he had removed
his spectacles a moment before. <q>And you have made a
very just remark about the mutual confidence, without which it is
sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such importance,
if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend himself and
is in a position to do so. We, on our side, will do everything
in our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting
the case. You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?</q> He turned to the
prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, undoubtedly,</q> replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat
cold, compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch's impulsiveness.
</p>

<p>
I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but
lately arrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect
for Ippolit Kirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his
bosom friend. He was almost the only person who put implicit
faith in Ippolit Kirillovitch's extraordinary talents as a psychologist
and orator and in the justice of his grievance. He had heard of him
in Petersburg. On the other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch
was the only person in the whole world whom our <q>unappreciated</q>
prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way to Mokroe they had
time to come to an understanding about the present case. And now
as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and interpreted
every indication on his senior colleague's face&mdash;half a word,
a glance, or a wink.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don't interrupt
me with trivial questions and I'll tell you everything in a moment,</q>
said Mitya excitedly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your
communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little
fact of great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed
<pb n='524'/><anchor id='Pg524'/>
yesterday at about five o'clock on the security of your pistols, from
your friend, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles.
What more? That's all about it. As soon as I got back to town I
pledged them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn't
you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic
description of all you did yesterday, from the morning
onwards? Allow us, for instance, to inquire why you were absent
from the town, and just when you left and when you came back&mdash;all
those facts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You should have asked me like that from the beginning,</q> cried
Mitya, laughing aloud, <q>and, if you like, we won't begin from yesterday,
but from the morning of the day before; then you'll understand
how, why, and where I went. I went the day before yesterday,
gentlemen, to a merchant of the town, called Samsonov, to
borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security. It was
a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to interrupt you,</q> the prosecutor put in politely.
<q>Why were you in such pressing need for just that sum, three
thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, gentlemen, you needn't go into details, how, when and why,
and why just so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole.
Why, it'll run to three volumes, and then you'll want an
epilogue!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity
of a man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full
of the best intentions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen!</q>&mdash;he corrected himself hurriedly&mdash;<q>don't be vexed
with me for my restiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more,
I feel the greatest respect for you and understand the true position
of affairs. Don't think I'm drunk. I'm quite sober now. And,
besides, being drunk would be no hindrance. It's with me, you
know, like the saying: <q>When he is sober, he is a fool; when he is
drunk, he is a wise man.</q> Ha ha! But I see, gentlemen, it's not the
<pb n='525'/><anchor id='Pg525'/>
proper thing to make jokes to you, till we've had our explanation, I
mean. And I've my own dignity to keep up, too. I quite understand
the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position
of a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And
it's your business to watch me. I can't expect you to pat me on the
head for what I did to Grigory, for one can't break old men's heads
with impunity. I suppose you'll put me away for him for six
months, or a year perhaps, in a house of correction. I don't know
what the punishment is&mdash;but it will be without loss of the rights
of my rank, without loss of my rank, won't it? So you see, gentlemen,
I understand the distinction between us.... But you
must see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions.
<q>How did you step? Where did you step? When did you step?
And on what did you step?</q> I shall get mixed up, if you go on like
this, and you will put it all down against me. And what will that
lead to? To nothing! And even if it's nonsense I'm talking now,
let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being men of honor and refinement,
will forgive me! I'll finish by asking you, gentlemen, to
drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean, beginning
from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for breakfast,
how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention of
the criminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question,
<q>Whom did you murder? Whom did you rob?</q> Ha ha! That's
your regulation method, that's where all your cunning comes in.
You can put peasants off their guard like that, but not me. I know
the tricks. I've been in the service, too. Ha ha ha! You're not
angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence?</q> he cried, looking
at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising. <q>It's
only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would
be inexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya.
Ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the
prosecutor did not laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya,
as though anxious not to miss the least syllable, the slightest movement,
the smallest twitch of any feature of his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's how we have treated you from the beginning,</q> said
Nikolay Parfenovitch, still laughing. <q>We haven't tried to put you
out by asking how you got up in the morning and what you had for
<pb n='526'/><anchor id='Pg526'/>
breakfast. We began, indeed, with questions of the greatest
importance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still
more your present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness,
worthy of your noble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let
everything be on the footing of mutual confidence between educated,
well-bred people, who have the common bond of noble birth
and honor. In any case, allow me to look upon you as my best
friends at this moment of my life, at this moment when my honor
is assailed. That's no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the contrary. You've expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation.
</p>

<p>
<q>And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those
tricky questions!</q> cried Mitya enthusiastically. <q>Or there's simply
no knowing where we shall get to! Is there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will follow your sensible advice entirely,</q> the prosecutor interposed,
addressing Mitya. <q>I don't withdraw my question, however.
It is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you
needed that sum, I mean precisely three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another....
Well, it was to pay a debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A debt to whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I
couldn't, or because I shouldn't dare, or because it would be damaging,
for it's all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling, but&mdash;I won't,
because it's a matter of principle: that's my private life, and I won't
allow any intrusion into my private life. That's my principle. Your
question has no bearing on the case, and whatever has nothing to do
with the case is my private affair. I wanted to pay a debt. I wanted
to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won't say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to make a note of that,</q> said the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>By all means. Write down that I won't say, that I won't.
Write that I should think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can
write it; you've nothing else to do with your time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if
you are unaware of it,</q> the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and
stern impressiveness, <q>that you have a perfect right not to answer
<pb n='527'/><anchor id='Pg527'/>
the questions put to you now, and we on our side have no right to
extort an answer from you, if you decline to give it for one reason
or another. That is entirely a matter for your personal decision.
But it is our duty, on the other hand, in such cases as the present, to
explain and set before you the degree of injury you will be doing
yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of evidence. After
which I will beg you to continue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, I'm not angry ... I ...</q> Mitya muttered in a
rather disconcerted tone. <q>Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov
to whom I went then ...</q>
</p>

<p>
We will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known
to the reader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit
the slightest detail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it
over. But as he gave his evidence it was written down, and therefore
they had continually to pull him up. Mitya disliked this, but
submitted; got angry, though still good-humoredly. He did, it is
true, exclaim, from time to time, <q>Gentlemen, that's enough to
make an angel out of patience!</q> Or, <q>Gentlemen, it's no good
your irritating me.</q>
</p>

<p>
But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his
genially expansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made
a fool of him two days before. (He had completely realized by now
that he had been fooled.) The sale of his watch for six roubles
to obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers.
They were at once greatly interested, and even, to Mitya's intense
indignation, thought it necessary to write the fact down as a secondary
confirmation of the circumstance that he had hardly a farthing
in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya began to grow
surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, the night
spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return to the
town. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to give a
minute account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka's
account.
</p>

<p>
He was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly
into the circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya
Kondratyevna's house at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden to
keep watch on Grushenka, and of Smerdyakov's bringing him information.
They laid particular stress on this, and noted it down.
<pb n='528'/><anchor id='Pg528'/>
Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length, and though inwardly
ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to <q>public ignominy,</q>
so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in order to
tell the truth. The frigid severity, with which the investigating
lawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he
told his story, disconcerted him at last considerably.
</p>

<p>
<q>That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense
about women only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are
not worth my telling this to,</q> he reflected mournfully. <q>It's ignominious.
<q>Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.</q></q> He wound up his
reflections with that line. But he pulled himself together to go on
again. When he came to telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov,
he regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that
lady which had nothing to do with the case. But the investigating
lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he should pass on to
<q>more essential matters.</q> At last, when he described his despair and
told them how, when he left Madame Hohlakov's, he thought that
he'd <q>get three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it,</q>
they stopped him again and noted down that he had <q>meant to
murder some one.</q> Mitya let them write it without protest. At
last he reached the point in his story when he learned that Grushenka
had deceived him and had returned from Samsonov's as soon as he
left her there, though she had said that she would stay there till
midnight.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I didn't kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I
hadn't time,</q> broke from him suddenly at that point in his story.
That, too, was carefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and
was beginning to tell how he ran into his father's garden when the
investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him, and opening the big
portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass
pestle.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you recognize this object?</q> he asked, showing it to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes,</q> he laughed gloomily. <q>Of course I recognize it. Let
me have a look at it.... Damn it, never mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have forgotten to mention it,</q> observed the investigating
lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hang it all, I shouldn't have concealed it from you. Do you
<pb n='529'/><anchor id='Pg529'/>
suppose I could have managed without it? It simply escaped my
memory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself
with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.
</p>

<p>
<q>But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such
a weapon?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What for, if you had no object?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya's wrath flared up. He looked intently at <q>the boy</q> and
smiled gloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more
ashamed at having told <q>such people</q> the story of his jealousy so
sincerely and spontaneously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bother the pestle!</q> broke from him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But still&mdash;</q>
