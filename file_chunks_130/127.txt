and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the
eyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more
pompous, and ended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch
caught them, too, in his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled,
was forced, in spite of his evasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky
had substituted another pack of cards for the one he had provided,
and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated during the game. Kalganov
confirmed this, and both the Poles left the witness-box with damaged
reputations, amidst laughter from the public.
</p>

<p>
Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most
dangerous witnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on
all of them, and dismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers
and experts were lost in admiration, and were only at a loss to
understand what good purpose could be served by it, for all, I
repeat, felt that the case for the prosecution could not be refuted,
but was growing more and more tragically overwhelming. But from
the confidence of the <q>great magician</q> they saw that he was serene,
and they waited, feeling that <q>such a man</q> had not come from
Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to return unsuccessful.

<head>Chapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of Nuts</head>

<p>
The evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the
prisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not
reckoned much upon it. The medical line of defense had only been
<pb n='760'/><anchor id='Pg760'/>
taken up through the insistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent
for a celebrated doctor from Moscow on purpose. The case for the
defense could, of course, lose nothing by it and might, with luck,
gain something from it. There was, however, an element of comedy
about it, through the difference of opinion of the doctors. The
medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our doctor,
Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two
latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.
</p>

<p>
The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor
Herzenstube. He was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle
height and sturdy build. He was much esteemed and respected
by every one in the town. He was a conscientious doctor and an
excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or Moravian brother, I am not
quite sure which. He had been living amongst us for many years
and behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-hearted and
humane man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing,
visited them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine,
but he was as obstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into
his head, there was no shaking it. Almost every one in the town
was aware, by the way, that the famous doctor had, within the
first two or three days of his presence among us, uttered some
extremely offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube's qualifications.
Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five roubles for a visit,
several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his
arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense. All these
had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube, and
the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme
harshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw
them, <q>Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube?
He, he!</q> Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this,
and now all the three doctors made their appearance, one after
another, to be examined.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of
the prisoner's mental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his
grounds for this opinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality
was not only evident in many of the prisoner's actions in
the past, but was apparent even now at this very moment. When
he was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment,
<pb n='761'/><anchor id='Pg761'/>
the old doctor, with simple-hearted directness, pointed out that the
prisoner on entering the court had <q>an extraordinary air, remarkable
in the circumstances</q>; that he had <q>marched in like a soldier, looking
straight before him, though it would have been more natural
for him to look to the left where, among the public, the ladies
were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex and
must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,</q>
the old man concluded in his peculiar language.
</p>

<p>
I must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was
formed in German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it
had always been a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian
perfectly, better indeed than Russians. And he was very fond of
using Russian proverbs, always declaring that the Russian proverbs
were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world. I
may remark, too, that in conversation, through absent-mindedness
he often forgot the most ordinary words, which sometimes went out
of his head, though he knew them perfectly. The same thing happened,
though, when he spoke German, and at such times he always
waved his hand before his face as though trying to catch the lost
word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he had
found the missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to
have looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement
in the audience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor;
they knew, too, that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious
man of exemplary conduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures.
And so his unexpected observation struck every one as very queer.
</p>

<p>
The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and
emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner's mental condition
abnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and
with erudition of <q>aberration</q> and <q>mania,</q> and argued that, from
all the facts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition
of aberration for several days before his arrest, and, if the
crime had been committed by him, it must, even if he were conscious
of it, have been almost involuntary, as he had not the power
to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.
</p>

<p>
But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania,
which premised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the
future. (It must be noted that I report this in my own words, the
<pb n='762'/><anchor id='Pg762'/>
doctor made use of very learned and professional language.) <q>All
his actions are in contravention of common sense and logic,</q> he
continued. <q>Not to refer to what I have not seen, that is, the
crime itself and the whole catastrophe, the day before yesterday,
while he was talking to me, he had an unaccountably fixed look in
his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh
at. He showed continual and inexplicable irritability, using strange
words, <q>Bernard!</q> <q>Ethics!</q> and others equally inappropriate.</q> But
the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact that the prisoner
could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of which he considered
himself to have been cheated, without extraordinary irritation,
though he could speak comparatively lightly of other misfortunes
and grievances. According to all accounts, he had even in the
past, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was
touched on, flown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to
be a disinterested and not grasping man.
</p>

<p>
<q>As to the opinion of my learned colleague,</q> the Moscow doctor
added ironically in conclusion, <q>that the prisoner would, on entering
the court, have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before
him, I will only say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory,
it is radically unsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner,
on entering the court where his fate will be decided, would not naturally
look straight before him in that fixed way, and that that may
really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition, at the same time
I maintain that he would naturally not look to the left at the ladies,
but, on the contrary, to the right to find his legal adviser, on whose
help all his hopes rest and on whose defense all his future depends.</q>
The doctor expressed his opinion positively and emphatically.
</p>

<p>
But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave
the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the
experts. In his opinion the prisoner was now, and had been all
along, in a perfectly normal condition, and, although he certainly
must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before
his arrest, this might have been due to several perfectly obvious
causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness, and so on. But this
nervous condition would not involve the mental aberration of which
mention had just been made. As to the question whether the prisoner
should have looked to the left or to the right on entering the
<pb n='763'/><anchor id='Pg763'/>
court, <q>in his modest opinion,</q> the prisoner would naturally look
straight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done,
as that was where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were sitting.
So that it was just by looking straight before him that he
showed his perfectly normal state of mind at the present. The
young doctor concluded his <q>modest</q> testimony with some heat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo, doctor!</q> cried Mitya, from his seat, <q>just so!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor's opinion
had a decisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as
appeared afterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor
Herzenstube, when called as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of
use to Mitya. As an old resident in the town who had known the
Karamazov family for years, he furnished some facts of great value
for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though recalling something,
he added:
</p>

<p>
<q>But the poor young man might have had a very different life,
for he had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that
I know. But the Russian proverb says, <q>If a man has one head,
it's good, but if another clever man comes to visit him, it would be
better still, for then there will be two heads and not only one.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One head is good, but two are better,</q> the prosecutor put in
impatiently. He knew the old man's habit of talking slowly and
deliberately, regardless of the impression he was making and of the
delay he was causing, and highly prizing his flat, dull and always
gleefully complacent German wit. The old man was fond of
making jokes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, that's what I say,</q> he went on stubbornly. <q>One
head is good, but two are much better, but he did not meet another
head with wits, and his wits went. Where did they go? I've forgotten
the word.</q> He went on, passing his hand before his eyes,
<q>Oh, yes, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>spazieren</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wandering?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, wandering, that's what I say. Well, his wits went wandering
and fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he
was a grateful and sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well,
a little chap so high, left neglected by his father in the back yard,
when he ran about without boots on his feet, and his little breeches
hanging by one button.</q>
</p>

<pb n='764'/><anchor id='Pg764'/>

<p>
A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest
old man's voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting
something, and caught at it instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I
was forty-five then, and had only just come here. And I was so
sorry for the boy then; I asked myself why shouldn't I buy him a
pound of ... a pound of what? I've forgotten what it's called.
A pound of what children are very fond of, what is it, what is it?</q>
The doctor began waving his hands again. <q>It grows on a tree and
is gathered and given to every one....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Apples?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound....
No, there are a lot of them, and all little. You put them in the
mouth and crack.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nuts?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, nuts, I say so.</q> The doctor repeated in the calmest
way as though he had been at no loss for a word. <q>And I bought
him a pound of nuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound
of nuts before. And I lifted my finger and said to him, <q>Boy,
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Vater</foreign>.</q> He laughed and said,
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Vater</foreign>.</q>...
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Sohn</foreign>.</q> He laughed again and
lisped, <q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Sohn</foreign>.</q>
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der heilige Geist</foreign>.</q>
Then he laughed and said as best he could, <q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der
heilige Geist</foreign>.</q> I went away, and two days after I happened to be
passing, and he shouted to me of himself, <q>Uncle, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott
der Vater, Gott der Sohn</foreign>,</q> and he had only forgotten
<q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der heilige Geist</foreign>.</q>
But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for him again. But
he was taken away, and I did not see him again. Twenty-three years
passed. I am sitting one morning in my study, a white-haired old
man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man, whom
I should never have recognized, but he held up his finger and said,
laughing, <q><foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der Vater, Gott der
Sohn</foreign>, and <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gott der heilige Geist</foreign>.
I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of
nuts, for no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the
only one that ever did.</q> And then I remembered my happy youth
and the poor child in the yard, without boots on his feet, and my
heart was touched and I said, <q>You are a grateful young man, for
you have remembered all your life the pound of nuts I bought you
in your childhood.</q> And I embraced him and blessed him. And I
<pb n='765'/><anchor id='Pg765'/>
shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russian
often laughs when he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw
it. And now, alas!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you
saintly man,</q> Mitya cried suddenly.
</p>

<p>
In any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on
the public. But the chief sensation in Mitya's favor was created
by the evidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly.
Indeed, when the witnesses <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
décharge</foreign>, that is, called by the
defense, began giving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly
more favorable to Mitya, and what was particularly striking, this was
a surprise even to the counsel for the defense. But before Katerina
Ivanovna was called, Alyosha was examined, and he recalled a fact
which seemed to furnish positive evidence against one important
point made by the prosecution.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya</head>

<p>
It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was
not required to take the oath, and I remember that both sides
addressed him very gently and sympathetically. It was evident
that his reputation for goodness had preceded him. Alyosha gave
his evidence modestly and with restraint, but his warm sympathy
for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer to one question,
he sketched his brother's character as that of a man, violent-tempered
perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the same
time honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if
necessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for
Grushenka and his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of
late in an intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation
the suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for
the sake of gain, though he recognized that the three thousand roubles
had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that he looked upon
them as part of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father,
and that, indifferent as he was to money as a rule, he could not even
<pb n='766'/><anchor id='Pg766'/>
speak of that three thousand without fury. As for the rivalry of
the two <q>ladies,</q> as the prosecutor expressed it&mdash;that is, of Grushenka
and Katya&mdash;he answered evasively and was even unwilling
to answer one or two questions altogether.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your
father?</q> asked the prosecutor. <q>You can refuse to answer if you
think necessary,</q> he added.
</p>

<p>
<q>He did not tell me so directly,</q> answered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>How so? Did he indirectly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear
that at an extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might
perhaps murder him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you believed him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some
higher feeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has
indeed saved him, for it was not he killed my father,</q> Alyosha said
firmly, in a loud voice that was heard throughout the court.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity
of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your
affection for your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the
whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary
investigation. I won't attempt to conceal from you that it is highly
individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the
prosecution. And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what
facts have led you to this conviction of your brother's innocence and
of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at
the preliminary inquiry?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,</q>
replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. <q>I made no accusation
against Smerdyakov of myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yet you gave evidence against him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told
what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov
before I was examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is
innocent, and if he didn't commit the murder, then&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so
completely persuaded of your brother's innocence?</q>
</p>

<pb n='767'/><anchor id='Pg767'/>

<p>
<q>I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn't lie to
me. I saw from his face he wasn't lying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no other proof.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof whatever but
your brother's word and the expression of his face?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I have no other proof.</q>
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The
impression left by Alyosha's evidence on the public was most disappointing.
There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial;
some one had heard something, some one had pointed out something
else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary
proofs of his brother's innocence and Smerdyakov's guilt, and
after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions
so natural in a brother.
</p>

<p>
But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking
Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred
for his father and that he might kill him, and whether he had heard
it, for instance, at their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha
started as he answered, as though only just recollecting and
understanding something.
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten
myself. It wasn't clear to me at the time, but now&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he
recounted eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening
under the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck
himself on the breast, <q>the upper part of the breast,</q> and had repeated
several times that he had a means of regaining his honor,
that that means was here, here on his breast. <q>I thought, when he
struck himself on the breast, he meant that it was in his heart,</q>
Alyosha continued, <q>that he might find in his heart strength to save
himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him and
which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did
think at the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the
disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going to our
father and doing some violence to him. Yet it was just then that
he pointed to something on his breast, so that I remember the idea
struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the
<pb n='768'/><anchor id='Pg768'/>
breast, but below, and that he struck himself much too high, just
below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My idea seemed
silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to that
little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so,</q> Mitya cried from his place. <q>That's right, Alyosha,
it was the little bag I struck with my fist.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep
quiet, and at the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried
away himself by his recollection, warmly expressed his theory
that this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles
on him, which he might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half
of what he owed her, but which he had yet determined not to repay
her and to use for another purpose&mdash;namely, to enable him to elope
with Grushenka, if she consented.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is so, it must be so,</q> exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement.
<q>My brother cried several times that half of the disgrace,
half of it (he said <emph>half</emph> several times) he could free himself from at
once, but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of will that he
wouldn't do it ... that he knew beforehand he was incapable of
doing it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself
just on this part of the breast?</q> Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, <q>Why does
he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down?</q> and the
thought seemed stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming
stupid ... it flashed through my mind. That's what brought
it back to me just now. How could I have forgotten it till now?
It was that little bag he meant when he said he had the means but
wouldn't give back that fifteen hundred. And when he was arrested
at Mokroe he cried out&mdash;I know, I was told it&mdash;that he
considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had
the means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he
owed her, he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and
preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And
what torture, what torture that debt has been to him!</q> Alyosha
exclaimed in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to
describe once more how it had all happened, and several times insisted
<pb n='769'/><anchor id='Pg769'/>
on the question, <q>Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything?
Perhaps he had simply struck himself with his fist on the
breast?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it was not with his fist,</q> cried Alyosha; <q>he pointed with
his fingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have
so completely forgotten it till this moment?</q>
</p>

<p>
The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness's
evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing
to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just
below the neck, and that that was, of course, the disgrace, <q>A disgrace
I cannot deny, the most shameful act of my whole life,</q> cried
Mitya. <q>I might have repaid it and didn't repay it. I preferred
to remain a thief in her eyes rather than give it back. And the
most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I shouldn't
give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!</q>
</p>

<p>
So Alyosha's cross-examination ended. What was important and
striking about it was that one fact at least had been found, and even
though this were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence,
it did go some little way towards proving that the bag had
existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the
prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he
alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were <q>his own.</q>
Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved away to the seat
assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: <q>How was it I
forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come
back to me now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered
something extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched
their lorgnettes and opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men:
some stood up to get a better view. Everybody alleged afterwards
that Mitya had turned <q>white as a sheet</q> on her entrance. All in
black, she advanced modestly, almost timidly. It was impossible to
tell from her face that she was agitated; but there was a resolute
gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark that many people
mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that moment.
She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over
the court. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried
to appear composed. The President began his examination discreetly
<pb n='770'/><anchor id='Pg770'/>
and very respectfully, as though afraid to touch on <q>certain
chords,</q> and showing consideration for her great unhappiness. But
in answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied
firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, <q>until
he left me of his own accord...</q> she added quietly. When they
asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to
post to her relations, she said firmly, <q>I didn't give him the money
simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need
of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the understanding
that he should post it within the month if he cared to. There
was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.</q>
</p>

<p>
I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers
in detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon
as he got money from his father,</q> she went on. <q>I have never
doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous
honesty ... in money matters. He felt quite certain that he
would receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several
times about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have
always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father. I
don't remember any threat uttered by him against his father. He
certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come
to me at that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about
that unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming
to see me ... and I myself was put in such a position ... that
I could not invite him.... And I had no right, indeed, to be
exacting as to that money,</q> she added suddenly, and there was a
ring of resolution in her voice. <q>I was once indebted to him for
assistance in money for more than three thousand, and I took it, although
I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in a
position to repay my debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch
began his cross-examination.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your
acquaintance?</q> Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way,
instantly scenting something favorable. I must mention in parenthesis
that, though Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg
partly at the instance of Katerina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing
<pb n='771'/><anchor id='Pg771'/>
about the episode of the four thousand roubles given her by Mitya,
and of her <q>bowing to the ground to him.</q> She concealed this
from him and said nothing about it, and that was strange. It may
be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know till the
very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the
court, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.
</p>

<p>
No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her
story. She told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told
Alyosha, and her bowing to the ground, and her reason. She told
about her father and her going to Mitya, and did not in one word,
in a single hint, suggest that Mitya had himself, through her sister,
proposed they should <q>send him Katerina Ivanovna</q> to fetch the
money. She generously concealed that and was not ashamed to make
it appear as though she had of her own impulse run to the young
officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money. It
was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I
listened. The court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was
something unexampled. Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously
proud girl as she was, such an extremely frank avowal,
such sacrifice, such self-immolation, seemed incredible. And for
what, for whom? To save the man who had deceived and insulted
her and to help, in however small a degree, in saving him, by creating
a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, the figure of the
young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent girl,
handed her his last four thousand roubles&mdash;all he had in the world&mdash;was
thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ...
I had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might
come of it later (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all
over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was
perhaps not quite complete&mdash;that is, in the statement that the officer
had let the young lady depart <q>with nothing but a respectful bow.</q>
It was hinted that something was here omitted.
</p>

<p>
<q>And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole
story,</q> the most highly respected of our ladies maintained, <q>even
then it's very doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl
to behave in that way, even for the sake of saving her father.</q>
</p>

<p>
And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid
sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like
<pb n='772'/><anchor id='Pg772'/>
that? She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to
tell everything. Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the
truth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all
were deeply impressed by it. As for the judges and the lawyers,
they listened in reverent, almost shame-faced silence to Katerina
Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture upon even one question
on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her. Oh, he was
almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to
give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the
same man to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three
thousand&mdash;the idea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt
that now the charge of theft, at least, was as good as disproved.
<q>The case</q> was thrown into quite a different light. There was a
wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for him.... I was told that
once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her evidence, he
jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid his face in his
hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in a sobbing
voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Katya, why have you ruined me?</q> and his sobs were audible
all over the court. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried
again:
</p>

<p>
<q>Now I am condemned!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his
arms across his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and
sat down in her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast
down. Those who were sitting near her declared that for a long
time she shivered all over as though in a fever. Grushenka was
called.
</p>

<p>
I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the
final cause of Mitya's ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one&mdash;all
the lawyers said the same afterwards&mdash;that if the episode had
not occurred, the prisoner would at least have been recommended
to mercy. But of that later. A few words first about Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black
shawl on her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her
smooth, noiseless tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in
women of full figure. She looked steadily at the President, turning
her eyes neither to the right nor to the left. To my thinking she
<pb n='773'/><anchor id='Pg773'/>
looked very handsome at that moment, and not at all pale, as the
ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too, that she had a concentrated
and spiteful expression. I believe that she was simply
irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive
eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could not
stand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry
and eager to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There
was an element of timidity, too, of course, and inward shame at
her own timidity, so it was not strange that her tone kept changing.
At one moment it was angry, contemptuous and rough, and at
another there was a sincere note of self-condemnation. Sometimes
she spoke as though she were taking a desperate plunge; as though
she felt, <q>I don't care what happens, I'll say it....</q> Apropos of
her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarked curtly,
<q>That's all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pester me?</q>
But a minute later she added, <q>It was all my fault. I was laughing
at them both&mdash;at the old man and at him, too&mdash;and I brought both
of them to this. It was all on account of me it happened.</q>
</p>

<p>
Samsonov's name came up somehow. <q>That's nobody's business,</q>
she snapped at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. <q>He
was my benefactor; he took me when I hadn't a shoe to my foot,
when my family had turned me out.</q> The President reminded her,
though very politely, that she must answer the questions directly,
without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka crimsoned and
her eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
The envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only
heard from <q>that wicked wretch</q> that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an
envelope with notes for three thousand in it. <q>But that was all
foolishness. I was only laughing. I wouldn't have gone to him for
anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To whom are you referring as <q>that wicked wretch</q>?</q> inquired
the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged
himself last night.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such
a definite accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds
for it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him.
<pb n='774'/><anchor id='Pg774'/>
The woman who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause
of it all, let me tell you,</q> Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering
with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her voice.
</p>

<p>
She was again asked to whom she was referring.
</p>

<p>
<q>The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me,
offered me chocolate, tried to fascinate me. There's not much true
shame about her, I can tell you that....</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to
moderate her language. But the jealous woman's heart was burning,
and she did not care what she did.
</p>

<p>
<q>When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,</q> the prosecutor
asked, <q>every one saw and heard you run out of the next room and
cry out: <q>It's all my fault. We'll go to Siberia together!</q> So you
already believed him to have murdered his father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't remember what I felt at the time,</q> answered Grushenka.
<q>Every one was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt
that it was my fault, that it was on my account he had murdered
him. But when he said he wasn't guilty, I believed him at once, and
I believe him now and always shall believe him. He is not the man
to tell a lie.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that
among other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five
roubles <q>you paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov
to see you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There was nothing strange about his taking the money,</q> sneered
Grushenka, with angry contempt. <q>He was always coming to me
for money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me,
chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my help.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?</q> Fetyukovitch
asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother's sister.
But he's always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so
dreadfully ashamed of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the
town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told
that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka
had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had
given evidence against Mitya, and so she was angry. The whole
<pb n='775'/><anchor id='Pg775'/>
effect on the public, of Rakitin's speech, of his noble sentiments, of
his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was
this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another
godsend. Grushenka's cross-examination did not last long and, of
course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence.
She left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of
contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her
evidence and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from
Katerina Ivanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He
sat as though turned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Ivan was called to give evidence.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe</head>

<p>
I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the
usher of the court announced to the President that, owing to an
attack of illness or some sort of fit, the witness could not appear
at the moment, but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he
recovered. But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out
later.
</p>

<p>
His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The
principal witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been
questioned. Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling
almost fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard,
who probably had little information to give after all that had been
given. Time was passing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness,
looking at no one, and with his head bowed, as though plunged
in gloomy thought. He was irreproachably dressed, but his face
made a painful impression, on me at least: there was an earthy look
in it, a look like a dying man's. His eyes were lusterless; he raised
them and looked slowly round the court. Alyosha jumped up from
his seat and moaned <q>Ah!</q> I remember that, but it was hardly
noticed.
</p>

<p>
The President began by informing him that he was a witness not
on oath, that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of
<pb n='776'/><anchor id='Pg776'/>
course, he must bear witness according to his conscience, and so on,
and so on. Ivan listened and looked at him blankly, but his face
gradually relaxed into a smile, and as soon as the President, looking
at him in astonishment, finished, he laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, and what else?</q> he asked in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something
strange. The President showed signs of uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ... are perhaps still unwell?</q> he began, looking everywhere
for the usher.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and
can tell you something interesting,</q> Ivan answered with sudden
calmness and respectfulness.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have some special communication to make?</q> the President
went on, still mistrustfully.
</p>

<p>
Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head,
answered, almost stammering:
</p>

<p>
<q>No ... I haven't. I have nothing particular.</q>
</p>

<p>
They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,
with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew
more and more marked, though he answered rationally. To many
questions he answered that he did not know. He knew nothing of
his father's money relations with Dmitri. <q>I wasn't interested in
the subject,</q> he added. Threats to murder his father he had heard
from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he had heard
from Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>The same thing over and over again,</q> he interrupted suddenly,
with a look of weariness. <q>I have nothing particular to tell the
court.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,</q> the President
began.
</p>

<p>
He turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to
invite them to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly
asked in an exhausted voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
And with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned
to walk out of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still,
as though he had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know.
<pb n='777'/><anchor id='Pg777'/>
How does it go? <q>I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.</q>
They were trying to put on her sarafan to take her to church to be
married, and she said, <q>I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.</q>...
It's in some book about the peasantry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by that?</q> the President asked severely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, this,</q> Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. <q>Here's
the money ... the notes that lay in that envelope</q> (he nodded
towards the table on which lay the material evidence), <q>for the
sake of which our father was murdered. Where shall I put them?
Mr. Superintendent, take them.</q>
</p>

<p>
The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the
President.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could this money have come into your possession if it is
the same money?</q> the President asked wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday....
I was with him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not
my brother, killed our father. He murdered him and I incited him
to do it ... Who doesn't desire his father's death?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you in your right mind?</q> broke involuntarily from the
President.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty
mind as all of you ... as all these ... ugly faces.</q> He turned
suddenly to the audience. <q>My father has been murdered and they
pretend they are horrified,</q> he snarled, with furious contempt.
<q>They keep up the sham with one another. Liars! They all desire
the death of their fathers. One reptile devours another.... If
there hadn't been a murder, they'd have been angry and gone home
ill-humored. It's a spectacle they want! <foreign rend='italic'>Panem
et circenses</foreign>.
Though I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink
for Christ's sake!</q> He suddenly clutched his head.
</p>

<p>
The usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and
cried, <q>He is ill. Don't believe him: he has brain fever.</q> Katerina
Ivanovna rose impulsively from her seat and, rigid with horror,
gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and greedily looked at his brother
and listened to him with a wild, strange smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,</q>
Ivan began again. <q>You can't expect eloquence from a murderer,</q>
he added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh.
</p>

<pb n='778'/><anchor id='Pg778'/>

<p>
The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay.
The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch
pricked up his ears as he listened: the hall was hushed in
expectation. The President seemed suddenly to recollect himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here.
Calm yourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really
have something to tell. How can you confirm your statement ...
if indeed you are not delirious?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won't
send you proofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You
think of nothing but envelopes&mdash;one is enough. I've no witnesses ...
except one, perhaps,</q> he smiled thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is your witness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular!
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Le diable n'existe point!</foreign>
Don't pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful
devil,</q> he added suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were,
confidentially. <q>He is here somewhere, no doubt&mdash;under that table
with the material evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if
not there? You see, listen to me. I told him I don't want to keep
quiet, and he talked about the geological cataclysm ... idiocy!
Come, release the monster ... he's been singing a hymn. That's
because his heart is light! It's like a drunken man in the street
bawling how <q>Vanka went to Petersburg,</q> and I would give a quadrillion
quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You don't know me!
Oh, how stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him!
I didn't come for nothing.... Why, why is everything so
stupid?...</q>
</p>

<p>
And he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round
him again. But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha
rushed towards him, but the court usher had already seized Ivan
by the arm.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you about?</q> he cried, staring into the man's face,
and suddenly seizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently
to the floor. But the police were on the spot and he was seized.
He screamed furiously. And all the time he was being removed,
he yelled and screamed something incoherent.
</p>

<p>
The whole court was thrown into confusion. I don't remember
everything as it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow.
<pb n='779'/><anchor id='Pg779'/>
I only know that afterwards, when everything was quiet again
and every one understood what had happened, the court usher came
in for a reprimand, though he very reasonably explained that the
witness had been quite well, that the doctor had seen him an hour
ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but that, until he had
come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively, so that nothing
could have been foreseen&mdash;that he had, in fact, insisted on giving
evidence. But before every one had completely regained their composure
and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another.
Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking
loudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them
not to remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:
</p>

<p>
<q>There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here
is a document, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It's
a letter from that monster ... that man there, there!</q> she pointed
to Mitya. <q>It was he killed his father, you will see that directly.
He wrote to me how he would kill his father! But the other one is
ill, he is ill, he is delirious!</q> she kept crying out, beside herself.
</p>

<p>
The court usher took the document she held out to the President,
and she, dropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands,
began convulsively and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and
stifling every sound for fear she should be ejected from the court.
The document she had handed up was that letter Mitya had written
at the <q>Metropolis</q> tavern, which Ivan had spoken of as a <q>mathematical
proof.</q> Alas! its mathematical conclusiveness was recognized,
and had it not been for that letter, Mitya might have escaped
his doom or, at least, that doom would have been less terrible. It
was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What followed is still
confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, have at once
passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on
both sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness.
On being gently asked by the President whether she had recovered
sufficiently, Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:
</p>

<p>
<q>I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,</q>
she added, evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented
from giving evidence. She was asked to explain in detail
what this letter was and under what circumstances she received it.
</p>

<p>
<q>I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he
<pb n='780'/><anchor id='Pg780'/>
wrote it the day before that, at the tavern&mdash;that is, two days before
he committed the crime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!</q>
she cried breathlessly. <q>He hated me at that time, because he had
behaved contemptibly and was running after that creature ... and
because he owed me that three thousand.... Oh! he was humiliated
by that three thousand on account of his own meanness! This
is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg you, I beseech
you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father, he
came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and
what he wanted it for. Yes, yes&mdash;to win that creature and carry
her off. I knew then that he had been false to me and meant to
abandon me, and it was I, I, who gave him that money, who offered
it to him on the pretext of his sending it to my sister in Moscow.
And as I gave it him, I looked him in the face and said that he could
send it when he liked, <q>in a month's time would do.</q> How, how
could he have failed to understand that I was practically telling him
to his face, <q>You want money to be false to me with your creature,
so here's the money for you. I give it to you myself. Take it, if
you have so little honor as to take it!</q> I wanted to prove what he
was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it
with that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I
knew all about it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him
that money to test him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of
honor as to take it from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked
into mine, and he understood it all and he took it&mdash;he carried off
my money!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true, Katya,</q> Mitya roared suddenly, <q>I looked into your
eyes and I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your
money. Despise me as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I've deserved
it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Prisoner,</q> cried the President, <q>another word and I will order
you to be removed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That money was a torment to him,</q> Katya went on with impulsive
haste. <q>He wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that's
true; but he needed money for that creature, too. So he murdered
his father, but he didn't repay me, and went off with her to that
village where he was arrested. There, again, he squandered the
money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a day
<pb n='781'/><anchor id='Pg781'/>
before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he
wrote it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite,
and feeling certain, positively certain, that I should never show it
to any one, even if he did kill him, or else he wouldn't have written
it. For he knew I shouldn't want to revenge myself and ruin him!
But read it, read it attentively&mdash;more attentively, please&mdash;and you
will see that he had described it all in his letter, all beforehand, how
he would kill his father and where his money was kept. Look, please,
don't overlook that, there's one phrase there, <q>I shall kill him as
soon as Ivan has gone away.</q> So he thought it all out beforehand
how he would kill him,</q> Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court
with venomous and malignant triumph. Oh! it was clear she had
studied every line of that letter and detected every meaning underlining
it. <q>If he hadn't been drunk, he wouldn't have written to
me; but, look, everything is written there beforehand, just as he
committed the murder after. A complete program of it!</q> she exclaimed
frantically.
</p>

<p>
She was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no
doubt, she had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then,
perhaps, shaking with anger, she had pondered whether to show it
at the trial or not. Now she had taken the fatal plunge. I remember
that the letter was read aloud by the clerk, directly afterwards,
I believe. It made an overwhelming impression. They asked Mitya
whether he admitted having written the letter.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's mine, mine!</q> cried Mitya. <q>I shouldn't have written it, if
I hadn't been drunk!... We've hated each other for many things,
Katya, but I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you,
and you didn't love me!</q>
</p>

<p>
He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The
prosecutor and counsel for the defense began cross-examining her,
chiefly to ascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document
and to give her evidence in quite a different tone and spirit
just before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my
honor and my conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has
hated and despised me so!</q> Katya cried madly. <q>Oh, he has despised
me horribly, he has always despised me, and do you know,
he has despised me from the very moment that I bowed down to
<pb n='782'/><anchor id='Pg782'/>
him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once at the time,
but for a long time I wouldn't believe it. How often I have read it
in his eyes, <q>You came of yourself, though.</q> Oh, he didn't understand,
he had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but
baseness, he judged me by himself, he thought every one was like
himself!</q> Katya hissed furiously, in a perfect frenzy. <q>And he only
wanted to marry me, because I'd inherited a fortune, because of
that, because of that! I always suspected it was because of that!
Oh, he is a brute! He was always convinced that I should be
trembling with shame all my life before him, because I went to him
then, and that he had a right to despise me for ever for it, and so
to be superior to me&mdash;that's why he wanted to marry me! That's
so, that's all so! I tried to conquer him by my love&mdash;a love that
knew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he
understood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed?
He is a monster! I only received that letter the next evening: it
was brought me from the tavern&mdash;and only that morning, only
that morning I wanted to forgive him everything, everything&mdash;even
his treachery!</q>
</p>

<p>
The President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her.
I can't help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage
of her hysteria and of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing
them say to her, <q>We understand how hard it is for you; be
sure we are able to feel for you,</q> and so on, and so on. And yet
they dragged the evidence out of the raving, hysterical woman. She
described at last with extraordinary clearness, which is so often
seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought states, how
Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last two
months trying to save <q>the monster and murderer,</q> his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>He tortured himself,</q> she exclaimed, <q>he was always trying to
minimize his brother's guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had
never loved his father, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh,
he has a tender, over-tender conscience! He tormented himself
with his conscience! He told me everything, everything! He came
every day and talked to me as his only friend. I have the honor to
be his only friend!</q> she cried suddenly with a sort of defiance, and
her eyes flashed. <q>He had been twice to see Smerdyakov. One day
he came to me and said, <q>If it was not my brother, but Smerdyakov
<pb n='783'/><anchor id='Pg783'/>
committed the murder</q> (for the legend was circulating everywhere
that Smerdyakov had done it), <q>perhaps I too am guilty, for Smerdyakov
knew I didn't like my father and perhaps believed that I
desired my father's death.</q> Then I brought out that letter and
showed it him. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done
it, and he was overwhelmed by it. He couldn't endure the thought
that his own brother was a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that
it was making him ill. During the last few days he has talked incoherently
in my presence. I saw his mind was giving way. He
walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the streets. The
doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the day before
yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever&mdash;and
all on his account, on account of this monster! And last night he
learnt that Smerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove
him out of his mind ... and all through this monster, all for the
sake of saving the monster!</q>
</p>

<p>
Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible
once in a lifetime&mdash;at the hour of death, for instance, on the way
to the scaffold! But it was in Katya's character, and it was such
a moment in her life. It was the same impetuous Katya who had
thrown herself on the mercy of a young profligate to save her father;
the same Katya who had just before, in her pride and chastity,
sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty before all these people,
telling of Mitya's generous conduct, in the hope of softening his
fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself; but this time
it was for another, and perhaps only now&mdash;perhaps only at this
moment&mdash;she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She
had sacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden
that he had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who
had committed the murder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself
to save him, to save his good name, his reputation!
</p>

<p>
And yet one terrible doubt occurred to one&mdash;was she lying in
her description of her former relations with Mitya?&mdash;that was the
question. No, she had not intentionally slandered him when she
cried that Mitya despised her for her bowing down to him! She
believed it herself. She had been firmly convinced, perhaps ever
since that bow, that the simple-hearted Mitya, who even then adored
her, was laughing at her and despising her. She had loved him with
<pb n='784'/><anchor id='Pg784'/>
an hysterical, <q>lacerated</q> love only from pride, from wounded
pride, and that love was not like love, but more like revenge. Oh!
perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love, perhaps
Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya's faithlessness
had wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart
could not forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her
suddenly, and all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully
in the offended woman's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly.
She betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed herself, too. And
no sooner had she given full expression to her feelings than the
tension of course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame.
Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor, sobbing and screaming.
She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with a wail,
rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya,</q> she wailed, <q>your serpent has destroyed you! There,
she has shown you what she is!</q> she shouted to the judges, shaking
with anger. At a signal from the President they seized her and tried
to remove her from the court. She wouldn't allow it. She fought
and struggled to get back to Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and
struggled to get to her. He was overpowered.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have
been satisfied&mdash;the show had been a varied one. Then I remember
the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President
had previously sent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for
Ivan. The doctor announced to the court that the sick man was
suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever, and that he must
be at once removed. In answer to questions from the prosecutor
and the counsel for the defense he said that the patient had come
to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and that he had
warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had not
consented to be looked after. <q>He was certainly not in a normal
state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was
awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead,
and that Satan visited him every evening,</q> said the doctor, in conclusion.
Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew.
The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the
material proofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to
proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of
<pb n='785'/><anchor id='Pg785'/>
evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.
</p>

<p>
But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only
repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with
their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together
in the prosecutor's speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every
one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe,
and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense
with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken
by Katerina Ivanovna's evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant.
When all the evidence had been taken, the court was
adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o'clock
when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit
Kirillovitch, began his speech.

<head>Chapter VI. The Prosecutor's Speech. Sketches Of Character</head>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with
nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and
cold all over by turns. He described this himself afterwards. He
regarded this speech as his <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chef-d'œuvre</foreign>,
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chef-d'œuvre</foreign> of his
whole life, as his swan-song. He died, it is true, nine months later
of rapid consumption, so that he had the right, as it turned out,
to compare himself to a swan singing his last song. He had put his
whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech. And poor
Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some feeling
for the public welfare and <q>the eternal question</q> lay concealed in
him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity. He
genuinely believed in the prisoner's guilt; he was accusing him not
as an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered
with a genuine passion <q>for the security of society.</q> Even the
ladies in the audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch,
admitted that he made an extraordinary impression on them.
He began in a breaking voice, but it soon gained strength and filled
the court to the end of his speech. But as soon as he had finished,
he almost fainted.
</p>

<pb n='786'/><anchor id='Pg786'/>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> began the prosecutor, <q rend='pre'>this case has
made a stir throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at,
what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed
to such crimes! That's what's so horrible, that such dark
deeds have ceased to horrify us. What ought to horrify us is that
we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated crime.
What are the causes of our indifference, our lukewarm attitude to
such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an unenviable
future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of intellect
and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in spite
of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their
foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles
among us? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are
disturbing, and every citizen not only must, but ought to be
harassed by them. Our newborn and still timid press has done
good service to the public already, for without it we should never
have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral degradation
which are continually made known by the press, not merely to
those who attend the new jury courts established in the present
reign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of
things beside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost
commonplace. But what is most important is that the majority of
our national crimes of violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now
so general among us that it is difficult to contend against it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the
very outset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a
pang of conscience, murdering an official who had once been his
benefactor, and the servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what
ready money he could find on him; <q>it will come in handy for my
pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future.</q>
After murdering them, he puts pillows under the head of each of
his victims; he goes away. Next, a young hero <q>decorated for
bravery</q> kills the mother of his chief and benefactor, like a highwayman,
and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that <q>she
loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take
no precautions.</q> Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in
these days that he is unique. Another man will not commit the
murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in
<pb n='787'/><anchor id='Pg787'/>
soul. In silence, alone with his conscience, he asks himself perhaps,
<q>What is honor, and isn't the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical,
that it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let
them say so&mdash;and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were
so! Oh, don't believe me, think of me as morbid, but remember my
words; if only a tenth, if only a twentieth part of what I say is true&mdash;even
so it's awful! Look how our young people commit suicide,
without asking themselves Hamlet's question what there is beyond,
without a sign of such a question, as though all that relates to the
soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long been erased
in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice, at
our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present
case, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of
them. And yet we all knew him, <q>he lived among us!</q>...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of
Europe will study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject
is worth it. But this study will come later, at leisure, when all the
tragic topsy-turvydom of to-day is farther behind us, so that it's
possible to examine it with more insight and more impartiality than
I can do. Now we are either horrified or pretend to be horrified,
though we really gloat over the spectacle, and love strong and eccentric
sensations which tickle our cynical, pampered idleness. Or,
like little children, we brush the dreadful ghosts away and hide
our heads in the pillow so as to return to our sports and merriment
as soon as they have vanished. But we must one day begin life in
sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society; it's time we
tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least to make
a beginning in that direction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A great writer<note place='foot'>Gogol is meant.</note> of the last epoch, comparing
Russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, <q>Oh, troika, birdlike
troika, who invented thee!</q> and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the
peoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the
recklessly galloping troika to pass. That may be, they may stand
aside, respectfully or no, but in my poor opinion the great writer
ended his book in this way either in an access of childish and naïve
<pb n='788'/><anchor id='Pg788'/>
optimism, or simply in fear of the censorship of the day. For if the
troika were drawn by his heroes, Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov,
it could reach no rational goal, whoever might be driving it.
And those were the heroes of an older generation, ours are worse
specimens still....</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch's speech was interrupted by applause.
The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The
applause was, it's true, of brief duration, so that the President did
not think it necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely
in the direction of the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged;
he had never been applauded before! He had been all
his life unable to get a hearing, and now he suddenly had an opportunity
of securing the ear of all Russia.
</p>

<p>
<q>What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such
an unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?</q> he continued. <q rend='pre'>Perhaps
I am exaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental
features of the educated class of to-day are reflected in this
family picture&mdash;only, of course, in miniature, <q>like the sun in a
drop of water.</q> Think of that unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man,
who has met with such a melancholy end, the head of a family!
Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor dependent position,
through an unexpected marriage he came into a small fortune. A
petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though undeveloped,
intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grew
bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristics
disappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that
remained. On the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his
vitality was excessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure,
and he brought his children up to be the same. He had no feelings
for his duties as a father. He ridiculed those duties. He left his
little children to the servants, and was glad to be rid of them, forgot
about them completely. The old man's maxim was <foreign lang='fr'
rend='italic'>Après moi le déluge</foreign>. He was an
example of everything that is opposed to civic
duty, of the most complete and malignant individualism. <q>The
world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all right,</q> and he
was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on living in the
same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own
son and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get
<pb n='789'/><anchor id='Pg789'/>
his mistress from him. No, I don't intend to leave the prisoner's
defense altogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I
will speak the truth myself, I can well understand what resentment
he had heaped up in his son's heart against him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the
penalty. Let us remember, however, that he was a father, and one
of the typical fathers of to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that
he is typical of many modern fathers? Alas! many of them only
differ in not openly professing such cynicism, for they are better
educated, more cultured, but their philosophy is essentially the same
as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, but you have agreed to forgive
me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not believe me, but let me
speak. Let me say what I have to say, and remember something of
my words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One
of them is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal
with him. Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education
and vigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He
has denied and rejected much already, like his father. We have all
heard him, he was a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed
his opinions, quite the contrary in fact, which justifies me
in speaking rather openly of him now, of course, not as an individual,
but as a member of the Karamazov family. Another personage
closely connected with the case died here by his own hand last night.
I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and possibly the illegitimate
son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the preliminary
inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young
Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. <q>Everything
in the world is lawful according to him, and nothing must be
forbidden in the future&mdash;that is what he always taught me.</q> I
believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory, though,
of course, the epileptic attacks from which he suffered, and this
terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his faculties. But he
dropped one very interesting observation, which would have done
credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed, why I've
mentioned it: <q>If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor Pavlovitch
in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n='790'/><anchor id='Pg790'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling
it indelicate to continue further. Oh, I don't want to draw any
further conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man's
future. We've seen to-day in this court that there are still good
impulses in his young heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed
in him by lack of faith and cynicism, which have come to
him rather by inheritance than by the exercise of independent
thought.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who
does not share his elder brother's gloomy and destructive theory of
life. He has sought to cling to the <q>ideas of the people,</q> or to what
goes by that name in some circles of our intellectual classes. He
clung to the monastery, and was within an ace of becoming a monk.
He seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously, and so early, that
timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society, who dread
cynicism and its corrupting influences, and mistakenly attribute all
the mischief to European enlightenment, to return to their <q>native
soil,</q> as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth,
like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered
bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only
to escape the horrors that terrify them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every
success; I trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the
ideas of the people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the
moral side into gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind
chauvinism&mdash;two elements which are even a greater menace to
Russia than the premature decay, due to misunderstanding and
gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his elder brother
is suffering.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of
chauvinism and mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed,
carried away by his own eloquence. All this had little to do with
the case in hand, to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat
vague, but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the
desire to express himself once in his life. People said afterwards that
he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism of Ivan, because
the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of him
in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to
<pb n='791'/><anchor id='Pg791'/>
take his revenge. But I don't know whether it was true. All this
was only introductory, however, and the speech passed to more
direct consideration of the case.
</p>

<p>
<q>But to return to the eldest son,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch went on.
<q rend='pre'>He is the prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too,
before us; the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the
surface. While his brothers seem to stand for <q>Europeanism</q> and
<q>the principles of the people,</q> he seems to represent Russia as she is.
Oh, not all Russia, not all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here
we have her, our mother Russia, the very scent and sound of her.
Oh, he is spontaneous, he is a marvelous mingling of good and evil,
he is a lover of culture and Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and
plucks out the beards of his boon companions. Oh, he, too, can be
good and noble, but only when all goes well with him. What is
more, he can be carried off his feet, positively carried off his feet
by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves, if they fall
from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. He dislikes
paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that's so
with him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life
(he couldn't be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way,
and he will show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no,
but he must have money, a great deal of money, and you will see
how generously, with what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all
away in the reckless dissipation of one night. But if he has not
money, he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in
great need of it. But all this later, let us take events in their
chronological order.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about
the back-yard <q>without boots on his feet,</q> as our worthy and esteemed
fellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now.
I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am
here to accuse him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human;
I, too, can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character.
But the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and
other reckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier
towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an officer. And, of
course, he needed money, money before all things, and so after prolonged
disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the last
<pb n='792'/><anchor id='Pg792'/>
six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he
practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with
his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and
brilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you
have only just heard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there,
and I will be silent. The figure of the young officer, frivolous and
profligate, doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown
in a very sympathetic light before us. But the other side of the
medal was unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very
court. Again I will not venture to conjecture why it happened so,
but there were causes. The same lady, bathed in tears of long-concealed
indignation, alleged that he, he of all men, had despised her
for her action, which, though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still
dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, the girl's betrothed,
looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable
from him than from any one. And knowing that he had
already deceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was
bound to endure everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally
offered him three thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly,
let him understand that she was offering him money to deceive her.
<q>Well, will you take it or not, are you so lost to shame?</q> was the
dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He looked at her, saw
clearly what was in her mind (he's admitted here before you that
he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand unconditionally,
and squandered it in two days with the new object of his
affections.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young
officer sacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity
and doing reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a
rule, between two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the
present case this is not true. The probability is that in the first
case he was genuinely noble, and in the second as genuinely base.
And why? Because he was of the broad Karamazov character&mdash;that's
just what I am leading up to&mdash;capable of combining the most
incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest heights and
of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made by
a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close
<pb n='793'/><anchor id='Pg793'/>
quarters&mdash;Mr. Rakitin: <q>The sense of their own degradation is as
essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their
lofty generosity.</q> And that's true, they need continually this unnatural
mixture. Two extremes at the same moment, or they are
miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete. They are
wide, wide as mother Russia; they include everything and put up
with everything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we've just touched upon
that three thousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things
a little. Can you conceive that a man like that, on receiving that
sum and in such a way, at the price of such shame, such disgrace,
such utter degradation, could have been capable that very day of
setting apart half that sum, that very day, and sewing it up in a
little bag, and would have had the firmness of character to carry it
about with him for a whole month afterwards, in spite of every
temptation and his extreme need of it! Neither in drunken debauchery
in taverns, nor when he was flying into the country, trying
to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him to
remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his
father, did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only
to avoid abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so
jealous, he would have been certain to have opened that bag and to
have stayed at home to keep watch over her, and to await the moment
when she would say to him at last <q>I am yours,</q> and to fly with
her far from their fatal surroundings.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason
he gives for it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when
she would say, <q>I am yours, take me where you will,</q> he might have
the wherewithal to take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner's
own words, was of little weight beside the second. While I have
that money on me, he said, I am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can
always go to my insulted betrothed, and, laying down half the sum
I have fraudulently appropriated, I can always say to her, <q>You see,
I've squandered half your money, and shown I am a weak and immoral
man, and, if you like, a scoundrel</q> (I use the prisoner's own
expressions), <q>but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a thief, for if
I had been a thief, I shouldn't have brought you back this half of
the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!</q> A
<pb n='794'/><anchor id='Pg794'/>
marvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not
resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at
the price of such disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most
stoical firmness, and carries about a thousand roubles without daring
to touch it. Does that fit in at all with the character we have
analyzed? No, and I venture to tell you how the real Dmitri
Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances, if he really
had brought himself to put away the money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At the first temptation&mdash;for instance, to entertain the woman
with whom he had already squandered half the money&mdash;he would
have unpicked his little bag and have taken out some hundred
roubles, for why should he have taken back precisely half the money,
that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why not fourteen hundred? He
could just as well have said then that he was not a thief, because he
brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time he
would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and
then a third, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he
would have taken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back
only a hundred it would answer the purpose, for a thief would have
stolen it all. And then he would have looked at this last note, and
have said to himself, <q>It's really not worth while to give back one
hundred; let's spend that, too!</q> That's how the real Dmitri Karamazov,
as we know him, would have behaved. One cannot imagine
anything more incongruous with the actual fact than this legend
of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable. But we
shall return to that later.</q>
</p>

<p>
After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning
the financial relations of father and son, and arguing again
and again that it was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to
determine which was in the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to
the evidence of the medical experts in reference to Mitya's fixed idea
about the three thousand owing him.

<p>
<q>The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner
is out of his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain
that he is in his right mind, and that if he had not been, he would
have behaved more cleverly. As for his being a maniac, that I
would agree with, but only in one point, that is, his fixed idea about
the three thousand. Yet I think one might find a much simpler
cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part I agree thoroughly
with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner's mental
faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been irritable
and exasperated. The object of the prisoner's continual and violent
anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the
bottom of it. That motive is jealousy!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner's fatal
passion for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner
went to the <q>young person's</q> lodgings <q>to beat her</q>&mdash;<q>I use
his own expression,</q> the prosecutor explained&mdash;<q rend='pre'>but instead of
beating her, he remained there, at her feet. That was the beginning of
the passion. At the same time the prisoner's father was captivated
by the same young person&mdash;a strange and fatal coincidence, for they
both lost their hearts to her simultaneously, though both had known
her before. And she inspired in both of them the most violent,
characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her own confession:
<q>I was laughing at both of them.</q> Yes, the sudden desire to make a
jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once.
The old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand
roubles as a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he
would have been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet,
if only she would become his lawful wife. We have good evidence
of this. As for the prisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it
is before us. But such was the young person's <q>game.</q> The enchantress
gave the unhappy young man no hope until the last moment,
when he knelt before her, stretching out hands that were
already stained with the blood of his father and rival. It was in
<pb n='796'/><anchor id='Pg796'/>
that position that he was arrested. <q>Send me to Siberia with him, I
have brought him to this, I am most to blame,</q> the woman herself
cried, in genuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr.
Rakitin, characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms:
<q>She was disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed,
who seduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty,
cursed by her respectable family, and taken under the protection of
a wealthy old man, whom she still, however, considers as her benefactor.
There was perhaps much that was good in her young heart,
but it was embittered too early. She became prudent and saved
money. She grew sarcastic and resentful against society.</q> After this
sketch of her character it may well be understood that she might
laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from malice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during
which he betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted
to his honor, the prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to
madness by continual jealousy&mdash;and of whom? His father! And
the worst of it was that the crazy old man was alluring and enticing
the object of his affection by means of that very three thousand
roubles, which the son looked upon as his own property, part of his
inheritance from his mother, of which his father was cheating him.
Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man to
madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was
used with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering
his father had entered the prisoner's head, and illustrated his
theory with facts.
</p>

<p>
<q>At first he only talked about it in taverns&mdash;he was talking about
it all that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company,
and he likes to tell his companions everything, even his most
diabolical and dangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with
others, and expects, for some reason, that those he confides in will
meet him with perfect sympathy, enter into all his troubles and
anxieties, take his part and not oppose him in anything. If not, he
flies into a rage and smashes up everything in the tavern. [Then followed
the anecdote about Captain Snegiryov.] Those who heard
<pb n='797'/><anchor id='Pg797'/>
the prisoner began to think at last that he might mean more than
threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats into actions.</q>
</p>

<p>
Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the
monastery, the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene
of violence when the prisoner had rushed into his father's house just
after dinner.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot positively assert,</q> the prosecutor continued, <q>that the
prisoner fully intended to murder his father before that incident.
Yet the idea had several times presented itself to him, and he had
deliberated on it&mdash;for that we have facts, witnesses, and his own
words. I confess, gentlemen of the jury,</q> he added, <q rend='pre'>that till to-day
I have been uncertain whether to attribute to the prisoner conscious
premeditation. I was firmly convinced that he had pictured the
fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating
it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered when and how
he might commit the crime.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was
presented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young
lady's exclamation, <q>It is the plan, the program of the murder!</q>
That is how she defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy
prisoner. And, in fact, from that letter we see that the whole
fact of the murder was premeditated. It was written two days
before, and so we know now for a fact that, forty-eight hours
before the perpetration of his terrible design, the prisoner swore
that, if he could not get money next day, he would murder his
father in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his
pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. <q>As soon as Ivan had gone away</q>&mdash;you
hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every
circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it.
The proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been
committed for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is
written and signed. The prisoner does not deny his signature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does
not diminish the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote
when drunk what he had planned when sober. Had he not planned
it when sober, he would not have written it when drunk. I shall
be asked: Then why did he talk about it in taverns? A man who
<pb n='798'/><anchor id='Pg798'/>
premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself. Yes, but
he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when he had only
the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less about
it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the <q>Metropolis</q> tavern,
contrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking.
He did not play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He
did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost
unconsciously, because he could never enter a tavern without making
a disturbance. It is true that after he had taken the final decision,
he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked too much
about his design beforehand, and that this might lead to his arrest
and prosecution afterwards. But there was nothing for it; he could
not take his words back, but his luck had served him before, it
would serve him again. He believed in his star, you know! I must
confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe.
<q>To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,</q> as he
writes in his peculiar language, <q>and if they won't give it to me,
there will be bloodshed.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all
Mitya's efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to
Samsonov, his journey to Lyagavy. <q>Harassed, jeered at, hungry,
after selling his watch to pay for the journey (though he tells us he
had fifteen hundred roubles on him&mdash;a likely story), tortured by
jealousy at having left the object of his affections in the town, suspecting
that she would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his absence, he
returned at last to the town, to find, to his joy, that she had not
been near his father. He accompanied her himself to her protector.
(Strange to say, he doesn't seem to have been jealous of Samsonov,
which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to his
ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in
a fit, that the other servant is ill&mdash;the coast is clear and he knows
the <q>signals</q>&mdash;what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a
lady who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is
highly esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who
had long watched his career with compassion, gave him the most
judicious advice, to give up his dissipated life, his unseemly love-affair,
the waste of his youth and vigor in pot-house debauchery, and
to set off to Siberia to the gold-mines: <q>that would be an outlet for
<pb n='799'/><anchor id='Pg799'/>
your turbulent energies, your romantic character, your thirst for
adventure.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
After describing the result of this conversation and the moment
when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov's,
