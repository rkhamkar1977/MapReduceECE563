those days though duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a
kind of fashion among the officers&mdash;so strong and deeply rooted
will a brutal prejudice sometimes be.
</p>

<p>
It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at
seven o'clock the next day on the outskirts of the town&mdash;and then
something happened that in very truth was the turning-point of my
life. In the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor,
I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him two blows
in the face with all my might, so that it was covered with blood.
He had not long been in my service and I had struck him before,
but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it's
forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went to bed
and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was
breaking. I got up&mdash;I did not want to sleep any more&mdash;I went
to the window&mdash;opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw
the sun rising; it was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the meaning of it?</q> I thought. <q>I feel in my heart as
it were something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to
shed blood? No,</q> I thought, <q>I feel it's not that. Can it be that
I am afraid of death, afraid of being killed? No, that's not it,
that's not it at all.</q>... And all at once I knew what it was: it
was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose
before my mind, it all was as it were repeated over again; he stood
before me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was
holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me
as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even
dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has
been brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature!
What a crime! It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me
right through. I stood as if I were struck dumb, while the sun
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the
praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands, fell on my bed and
broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my brother
Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: <q>My dear
ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your
waiting on me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, am I worth it?</q> flashed through my mind. <q>After all what
am I worth, that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness
and image of God, should serve me?</q> For the first time in my
life this question forced itself upon me. He had said, <q>Mother, my
little heart, in truth we are each responsible to all for all, it's only
that men don't know this. If they knew it, the world would be a
paradise at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God, can that too be false?</q> I thought as I wept. <q>In truth,
perhaps, I am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner
than all men in the world.</q> And all at once the whole truth in
its full light appeared to me; what was I going to do? I was going
to kill a good, clever, noble man, who had done me no wrong, and
by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life, I should
be torturing and killing her too. I lay thus in my bed with my
face in the pillow, heedless how the time was passing. Suddenly my
second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah,</q> said he, <q>it's a good thing you are up already, it's time we
were off, come along!</q>
</p>

<p>
I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we
went out to the carriage, however.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait here a minute,</q> I said to him. <q>I'll be back directly, I have
forgotten my purse.</q>
</p>

<p>
And I ran back alone, to Afanasy's little room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Afanasy,</q> I said, <q>I gave you two blows on the face yesterday,
forgive me,</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
He started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I
saw that it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer's uniform,
I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me,</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
Then he was completely aghast.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>

<p>
And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his
hands, turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I
flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ready,</q> I cried. <q>Have you ever seen a conqueror?</q> I asked
him. <q>Here is one before you.</q>
</p>

<p>
I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't remember
what about.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me. <q>Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll
keep up the honor of the uniform, I can see.</q>
</p>

<p>
So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We
were placed twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly,
looking him full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked
lovingly at him, for I knew what I would do. His shot just grazed
my cheek and ear.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God,</q> I cried, <q>no man has been killed,</q> and I seized my
pistol, turned back and flung it far away into the wood. <q>That's
the place for you,</q> I cried.
</p>

<p>
I turned to my adversary.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,</q> I said, <q>for my unprovoked
insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten
times worse than you and more, maybe. Tell that to the person
whom you hold dearest in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word,</q> cried my adversary, annoyed, <q>if you did not
want to fight, why did not you let me alone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,</q> I answered him
gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to
agree with your opinion,</q> said he.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo,</q> I cried, clapping my hands. <q>I agree with you there too.
I have deserved it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you shoot, sir, or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I won't,</q> I said; <q>if you like, fire at me again, but it would
be better for you not to fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: <q>Can you disgrace
the regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his
forgiveness! If I'd only known this!</q>
</p>

<p>
I stood facing them all, not laughing now.
</p>

<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> I said, <q>is it really so wonderful in these days to
find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his
wrongdoing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But not in a duel,</q> cried my second again.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what's so strange,</q> I said. <q>For I ought to have owned
my fault as soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before
leading him into a great and deadly sin; but we have made our life
so grotesque, that to act in that way would have been almost impossible,
for only after I have faced his shot at the distance of twelve
paces could my words have any significance for him, and if I had
spoken before, he would have said, <q>He is a coward, the sight of the
pistols has frightened him, no use to listen to him.</q> Gentlemen,</q> I
cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, <q>look around you
at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the
birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and
foolish, and we don't understand that life is heaven, for we have
only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its
beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.</q>
</p>

<p>
I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with
the sweetness and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss
in my heart as I had never known before in my life.
</p>

<p>
<q>All this as rational and edifying,</q> said my antagonist, <q>and in
any case you are an original person.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may laugh,</q> I said to him, laughing too, <q>but afterwards
you will approve of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,</q> said he; <q>will you shake
hands? for I believe you are genuinely sincere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> I said, <q>not now, later on when I have grown worthier and
deserve your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.</q>
</p>

<p>
We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I
kissed him. All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered
together to pass judgment on me the same day.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has disgraced the uniform,</q> they said; <q>let him resign his
commission.</q>
</p>

<p>
Some stood up for me: <q>He faced the shot,</q> they said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own
<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/>
pistol first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into
the forest. No, there's something else in this, something original.</q>
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed listening and looking at them. <q>My dear friends and
comrades,</q> said I, <q>don't worry about my resigning my commission,
for I have done so already. I have sent in my papers this morning
and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery&mdash;it's
with that object I am leaving the regiment.</q>
</p>

<p>
When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
<q>You should have told us of that first, that explains everything,
we can't judge a monk.</q>
</p>

<p>
They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully,
but kindly and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even
those who had been sternest in their censure, and all the following
month, before my discharge came, they could not make enough of
me. <q>Ah, you monk,</q> they would say. And every one said something
kind to me, they began trying to dissuade me, even to pity
me: <q>What are you doing to yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> they would say, <q>he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and
could have fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before
that he should become a monk, that's why he did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I
had been kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention,
and now all came to know me at once and invited me; they
laughed at me, but they loved me. I may mention that although
everybody talked openly of our duel, the authorities took no notice
of it, because my antagonist was a near relation of our general, and
as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences, and as
I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And I began then
to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter, for it was
always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversations mostly
took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women particularly
liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can I possibly be responsible for all?</q> every one would
laugh in my face. <q>Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may well not know it,</q> I would answer, <q>since the whole
world has long been going on a different line, since we consider
the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others. Here
I have for once in my life acted sincerely and, well, you all look
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>
upon me as a madman. Though you are friendly to me, yet, you
see, you all laugh at me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can we help being friendly to you?</q> said my hostess,
laughing. The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young
lady rose, on whose account the duel had been fought and whom
only lately I had intended to be my future wife. I had not noticed
her coming into the room. She got up, came to me and held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me tell you,</q> she said, <q>that I am the first not to laugh at
you, but on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my
respect for you for your action then.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and
almost kissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention
was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me
with the others. I knew him by name already, but had never made
his acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(d) The Mysterious Visitor</hi>
</p>

<p>
He had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent
position, respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence.
He subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan
asylum; he was very charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only
became known after his death. He was a man of about fifty, almost
stern in appearance and not much given to conversation. He had
been married about ten years and his wife, who was still young, had
borne him three children. Well, I was sitting alone in my room
the following evening, when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman
walked in.
</p>

<p>
I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my
former quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms
with an old lady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady's
servant waited upon me, for I had moved into her rooms simply
because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the
regiment, as I felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last
interview with him. So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed
of any righteous action.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> said my visitor, <q>with great interest listened to you
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
speaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last
to make your personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately.
Can you, dear sir, grant me this favor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an
honor.</q> I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I
impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man.
For though other people had listened to me with interest and attention,
no one had come to me before with such a serious, stern and
concentrated expression. And now he had come to see me in my
own rooms. He sat down.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,</q> he said;
<q>as you have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you
risked incurring the contempt of all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,</q> I replied.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not excessive,</q> he answered; <q>believe me, such a course
of action is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has
impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to
you,</q> he continued. <q>Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed
by my perhaps unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations,
if you can recall them, at the moment when you made up
your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel. Do not think my question
frivolous; on the contrary, I have in asking the question a secret
motive of my own, which I will perhaps explain to you later on, if
it is God's will that we should become more intimately acquainted.</q>
</p>

<p>
All the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into
the face and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great
curiosity on my side also, for I felt that there was some strange
secret in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I
asked my opponent's forgiveness,</q> I answered; <q>but I had better tell
you from the beginning what I have not yet told any one else.</q>
And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me, and
how I had bowed down to the ground at his feet. <q>From that you
can see for yourself,</q> I concluded, <q>that at the time of the duel it
was easier for me, for I had made a beginning already at home, and
when once I had started on that road, to go farther along it was far
from being difficult, but became a source of joy and happiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. <q>All that,</q> he
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
said, <q>is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening.
And we should have become greater friends, if only he had
ever talked of himself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a
word, yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of that I
became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him
about all my feelings; <q>for,</q> thought I, <q>what need have I to know
his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a good man?
Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he comes
to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.</q> And I
learned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man
of lofty mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>That life is heaven,</q> he said to me suddenly, <q>that I have long
been thinking about</q>; and all at once he added, <q>I think of nothing
else indeed.</q> He looked at me and smiled. <q>I am more convinced
of it than you are, I will tell you later why.</q>
</p>

<p>
I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell
me something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven,</q> he went on, <q>lies hidden within all of us&mdash;here it lies
hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow
and for all time.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing
mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own
sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how
you could comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in
very truth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven
will be for them not a dream, but a living reality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when,</q> I cried out to him bitterly, <q>when will that come
to pass? and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream
of ours?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What then, you don't believe it,</q> he said. <q>You preach it and
don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will
come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every
process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform
the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another
path psychologically. Until you have become really, in actual fact,
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
a brother to every one, brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort
of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach
men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for
all. Every one will think his share too small and they will be always
envying, complaining and attacking one another. You ask when it
will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go
through the period of isolation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by isolation?</q> I asked him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age&mdash;it
has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For
every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes
to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime
all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction,
for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at
complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into
units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds
aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends
by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches
by himself and thinks, <q>How strong I am now and how secure,</q> and
in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up,
the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed
to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the
whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others,
in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose
his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere
in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand
that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather
than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism
must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how
unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the
spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long
in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the Son
of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must
keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and
his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so
draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act
of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.</q>
</p>

<p>
Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
fervent talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less
frequently. Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not
as blame, for they still loved me and treated me good-humoredly,
but there's no denying that fashion is a great power in society. I
began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration, for besides
enjoying his intelligence, I began to perceive that he was brooding
over some plan in his heart, and was preparing himself perhaps for
a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his
secret, not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by insinuation.
But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show signs of wanting
to tell me something. This had become quite evident, indeed, about
a month after he first began to visit me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know,</q> he said to me once, <q>that people are very inquisitive
about us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so
often. But let them wonder, for <emph>soon all will be explained</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and
almost always on such occasions he would get up and go away.
Sometimes he would fix a long piercing look upon me, and I
thought, <q>He will say something directly now.</q> But he would
suddenly begin talking of something ordinary and familiar. He
often complained of headache too.
</p>

<p>
One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking
with great fervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his
face worked convulsively, while he stared persistently at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter?</q> I said; <q>do you feel ill?</q>&mdash;he had just
been complaining of headache.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.</q>
</p>

<p>
He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. <q>Why
is it he is smiling?</q> The thought flashed through my mind before I
realized anything else. I too turned pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you saying?</q> I cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see,</q> he said, with a pale smile, <q>how much it has cost me
to say the first word. Now I have said it, I feel I've taken the first
step and shall go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
For a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him
at that time, but only after he had been to see me three days running
and told me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended
<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>
by being convinced, to my great grief and amazement. His crime
was a great and terrible one.
</p>

<p>
Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner,
a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in
our town. He fell passionately in love with her, declared his feeling
and tried to persuade her to marry him. But she had already
given her heart to another man, an officer of noble birth and high
rank in the service, who was at that time away at the front, though
she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer
and begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to
visit her, he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter
at night through the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery.
But, as often happens, a crime committed with extraordinary
audacity is more successful than others.
</p>

<p>
Entering the garret through the skylight, he went down the
ladder, knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes,
through the negligence of the servants, left unlocked. He hoped
to find it so, and so it was. He made his way in the dark to her
bedroom, where a light was burning. As though on purpose, both
her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the same street, without
asking leave. The other servants slept in the servants' quarters
or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passion flamed up at the
sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger took possession
of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he
thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then
with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion
should fall on the servants. He was so base as to take her purse,
to open her chest with keys from under her pillow, and to take
some things from it, doing it all as it might have been done by an
ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers and taking only money.
He took some of the larger gold things, but left smaller articles
that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too, some
things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done
this awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.
</p>

<p>
Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any
time after in his life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was
the criminal. No one indeed knew of his love for her, for he was
always reserved and silent and had no friend to whom he would
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>
have opened his heart. He was looked upon simply as an acquaintance,
and not a very intimate one, of the murdered woman, as for
the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf of hers
called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance confirmed
the suspicion. The man knew&mdash;indeed his mistress did not
conceal the fact&mdash;that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit
she had decided to send him, as he had no relations and his conduct
was unsatisfactory. People had heard him angrily threatening to
murder her when he was drunk in a tavern. Two days before her
death, he had run away, staying no one knew where in the town.
The day after the murder, he was found on the road leading out of
the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his right hand
happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose had
been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that
they had gone to a party and that the street-door had been left
open till they returned. And a number of similar details came to
light, throwing suspicion on the innocent servant.
</p>

<p>
They arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week
after the arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious
in the hospital. There the matter ended and the judges and
the authorities and every one in the town remained convinced that
the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had
died in the hospital. And after that the punishment began.
</p>

<p>
My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he
was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable
a long time, but not for that reason; only from regret that
he had killed the woman he loved, that she was no more, that in
killing her he had killed his love, while the fire of passion was still
in his veins. But of the innocent blood he had shed, of the murder
of a fellow creature, he scarcely thought. The thought that his
victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable
to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in his conscience
that he could not have acted otherwise.
</p>

<p>
At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness
and death soon set his mind at rest, for the man's death was apparently
(so he reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his
fright, but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away, when he
had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground. The theft of
<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>
the money and other things troubled him little, for he argued that
the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion.
The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards subscribed the
whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for maintaining an
almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his conscience
at rest about the theft, and it's a remarkable fact that for a long
time he really was at peace&mdash;he told me this himself. He entered
then upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for
a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and
being a man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he
recalled it, he tried not to think of it at all. He became active in
philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many institutions
in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow
and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies.
</p>

<p>
At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain
of it was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and
intelligent girl and soon after married her, hoping that marriage
would dispel his lonely depression, and that by entering on a new
life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and children, he
would escape from old memories altogether. But the very opposite
of what he expected happened. He began, even in the first month
of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the thought, <q>My wife
loves me&mdash;but what if she knew?</q> When she first told him that
she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. <q>I am giving life,
but I have taken life.</q> Children came. <q>How dare I love them,
teach and educate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have
shed blood.</q> They were splendid children, he longed to caress them;
<q>and I can't look at their innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the
blood of his murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed,
by the blood that cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have
awful dreams. But, being a man of fortitude, he bore his suffering
a long time, thinking: <q>I shall expiate everything by this secret
agony.</q> But that hope, too, was vain; the longer it went on, the
more intense was his suffering.
</p>

<p>
He was respected in society for his active benevolence, though
every one was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But
the more he was respected, the more intolerable it was for him. He
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>
confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself. But he
began to be haunted by another idea&mdash;an idea which he had at first
regarded as impossible and unthinkable, though at last it got such
a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off. He dreamed of
rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all men that
he had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued
him, haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his
whole heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul
and would be at peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with
terror, for how could he carry it out? And then came what happened
at my duel.
</p>

<p>
<q>Looking at you, I have made up my mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it possible,</q> I cried, clasping my hands, <q>that such a trivial
incident could give rise to such a resolution in you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My resolution has been growing for the last three years,</q> he
answered, <q>and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking
at you, I reproached myself and envied you.</q> He said this to me
almost sullenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you won't be believed,</q> I observed; <q>it's fourteen years
ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then I cried and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me one thing, one thing,</q> he said (as though it all depended
upon me), <q>my wife, my children! My wife may die of
grief, and though my children won't lose their rank and property,
they'll be a convict's children and for ever! And what a memory,
what a memory of me I shall leave in their hearts!</q>
</p>

<p>
I said nothing.
</p>

<p>
<q>And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It's for ever,
you know, for ever!</q>
</p>

<p>
I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt
afraid.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q> He looked at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go!</q> said I, <q>confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains.
Your children will understand, when they grow up, the nobility
of your resolution.</q>
</p>

<p>
He left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
for more than a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening,
still preparing himself, still unable to bring himself to the
point. He made my heart ache. One day he would come determined
and say fervently:
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess.
Fourteen years I've been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take
my punishment and begin to live. You can pass through the world
doing wrong, but there's no turning back. Now I dare not love
my neighbor nor even my own children. Good God, my children
will understand, perhaps, what my punishment has cost me and
will not condemn me! God is not in strength but in truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All will understand your sacrifice,</q> I said to him, <q>if not at
once, they will understand later; for you have served truth, the
higher truth, not of the earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he
would come again, bitter, pale, sarcastic.
</p>

<p>
<q>Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as
though to say, <q>He has still not confessed!</q> Wait a bit, don't despise
me too much. It's not such an easy thing to do, as you would think.
Perhaps I shall not do it at all. You won't go and inform against
me then, will you?</q>
</p>

<p>
And far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was
afraid to look at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my
heart was full of tears. I could not sleep at night.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have just come from my wife,</q> he went on. <q>Do you understand
what the word <q>wife</q> means? When I went out, the children
called to me, <q>Good-by, father, make haste back to read <hi rend='italic'>The Children's
Magazine</hi> with us.</q> No, you don't understand that! No
one is wise from another man's woe.</q>
</p>

<p>
His eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he
struck the table with his fist so that everything on it danced&mdash;it
was the first time he had done such a thing, he was such a mild
man.
</p>

<p>
<q>But need I?</q> he exclaimed, <q>must I? No one has been condemned,
no one has been sent to Siberia in my place, the man died
of fever. And I've been punished by my sufferings for the blood I
shed. And I shan't be believed, they won't believe my proofs.
Need I confess, need I? I am ready to go on suffering all my life
<pb n='343'/><anchor id='Pg343'/>
for the blood I have shed, if only my wife and children may be
spared. Will it be just to ruin them with me? Aren't we making
a mistake? What is right in this case? And will people recognize
it, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Lord!</q> I thought to myself, <q>he is thinking of other people's
respect at such a moment!</q> And I felt so sorry for him then,
that I believe I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted
him. I saw he was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing
with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Decide my fate!</q> he exclaimed again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go and confess,</q> I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but
I whispered it firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table,
the Russian translation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John,
chapter xii. verse 24:
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit.</q>
</p>

<p>
I had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read it.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true,</q> he said, but he smiled bitterly. <q>It's terrible the
things you find in those books,</q> he said, after a pause. <q>It's easy
enough to thrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they
have been written by men?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Holy Spirit wrote them,</q> said I.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's easy for you to prate,</q> he smiled again, this time almost with
hatred.
</p>

<p>
I took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him
the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31. He read:
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</q>
</p>

<p>
He read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling
all over.
</p>

<p>
<q>An awful text,</q> he said. <q>There's no denying you've picked
out fitting ones.</q> He rose from the chair. <q>Well!</q> he said, <q>good-by,
perhaps I shan't come again ... we shall meet in heaven. So
I have been for fourteen years <q>in the hands of the living God,</q>
that's how one must think of those fourteen years. To-morrow I
will beseech those hands to let me go.</q>
</p>

<p>
I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not dare&mdash;his
face was contorted and somber. He went away.
</p>

<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>

<p>
<q>Good God,</q> I thought, <q>what has he gone to face!</q> I fell on
my knees before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother
of God, our swift defender and helper. I was half an hour praying
in tears, and it was late, about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door
open and he came in again. I was surprised.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where have you been?</q> I asked him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think,</q> he said, <q>I've forgotten something ... my handkerchief,
I think.... Well, even if I've not forgotten anything, let
me stay a little.</q>
</p>

<p>
He sat down. I stood over him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You sit down, too,</q> said he.
</p>

<p>
I sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at
me and suddenly smiled&mdash;I remembered that&mdash;then he got up,
embraced me warmly and kissed me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Remember,</q> he said, <q>how I came to you a second time. Do you
hear, remember it!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he went out.
</p>

<p>
<q>To-morrow,</q> I thought.
</p>

<p>
And so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day
was his birthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I
had no chance of hearing it from any one. On that day he always
had a great gathering, every one in the town went to it. It was the
same this time. After dinner he walked into the middle of the
room, with a paper in his hand&mdash;a formal declaration to the chief
of his department who was present. This declaration he read aloud
to the whole assembly. It contained a full account of the crime, in
every detail.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,</q>
he said in conclusion. <q>I want to suffer for my sin!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had
been keeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his
crime, the jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had
stolen to divert suspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her neck
with a portrait of her betrothed in the locket, her notebook and
two letters; one from her betrothed, telling her that he would soon
be with her, and her unfinished answer left on the table to be sent
off next day. He carried off these two letters&mdash;what for? Why
<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>
had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards instead of destroying
them as evidence against him?
</p>

<p>
And this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified,
every one refused to believe it and thought that he was deranged,
though all listened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was
fully decided and agreed in every house that the unhappy man
was mad. The legal authorities could not refuse to take the case up,
but they too dropped it. Though the trinkets and letters made
them ponder, they decided that even if they did turn out to be
authentic, no charge could be based on those alone. Besides, she
might have given him those things as a friend, or asked him to take
care of them for her. I heard afterwards, however, that the genuineness
of the things was proved by the friends and relations of the
murdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them. Yet
nothing was destined to come of it, after all.
</p>

<p>
Five days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life was
in danger. The nature of his illness I can't explain, they said it
was an affection of the heart. But it became known that the doctors
had been induced by his wife to investigate his mental condition
also, and had come to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity.
I betrayed nothing, though people ran to question me. But when I
wanted to visit him, I was for a long while forbidden to do so,
above all by his wife.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's you who have caused his illness,</q> she said to me; <q>he was
always gloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was
peculiarly excited and did strange things, and now you have been
the ruin of him. Your preaching has brought him to this; for the
last month he was always with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon
me and blamed me. <q>It's all your doing,</q> they said. I was silent
and indeed rejoiced at heart, for I saw plainly God's mercy to the
man who had turned against himself and punished himself. I could
not believe in his insanity.
</p>

<p>
They let me see him at last, he insisted upon saying good-by to
me. I went in to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but
his hours were numbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled,
he gasped for breath, but his face was full of tender and happy
feeling.
</p>

<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>

<p>
<q>It is done!</q> he said. <q>I've long been yearning to see you, why
didn't you come?</q>
</p>

<p>
I did not tell him that they would not let me see him.
</p>

<p>
<q>God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know
I am dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many
years. There was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done
what I had to do. Now I dare to love my children and to kiss
them. Neither my wife nor the judges, nor any one has believed
it. My children will never believe it either. I see in that
God's mercy to them. I shall die, and my name will be without a
stain for them. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as
in Heaven ... I have done my duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
He could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand
warmly, looking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his
wife kept peeping in at us. But he had time to whisper to me:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at
midnight? I told you to remember it. You know what I came
back for? I came to kill you!</q>
</p>

<p>
I started.
</p>

<p>
<q>I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about
the streets, struggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so
that I could hardly bear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds
me, and he is my judge. I can't refuse to face my punishment
to-morrow, for he knows all. It was not that I was afraid you
would betray me (I never even thought of that), but I thought,
<q>How can I look him in the face if I don't confess?</q> And if you had
been at the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been all
the same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing
everything and condemning me. I hated you as though you were the
cause, as though you were to blame for everything. I came back
to you then, remembering that you had a dagger lying on your
table. I sat down and asked you to sit down, and for a whole minute
I pondered. If I had killed you, I should have been ruined by
that murder even if I had not confessed the other. But I didn't think
about that at all, and I didn't want to think of it at that moment.
I only hated you and longed to revenge myself on you for everything.
The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let me tell
you, you were never nearer death.</q>
</p>

<pb n='347'/><anchor id='Pg347'/>

<p>
A week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave.
The chief priest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the
terrible illness that had cut short his days. But all the town was
up in arms against me after the funeral, and people even refused
to see me. Some, at first a few and afterwards more, began indeed
to believe in the truth of his story, and they visited me and questioned
me with great interest and eagerness, for man loves to see
the downfall and disgrace of the righteous. But I held my tongue,
and very shortly after, I left the town, and five months later by
God's grace I entered upon the safe and blessed path, praising the
unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I remember
in my prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who suffered
so greatly.

<head>Chapter III. Conversations And Exhortations Of Father Zossima</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance</hi>
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated
world the word is nowadays pronounced by some people with
a jeer, and by others it is used as a term of abuse, and this contempt
for the monk is growing. It is true, alas, it is true, that there are
many sluggards, gluttons, profligates and insolent beggars among
monks. Educated people point to these: <q>You are idlers, useless
members of society, you live on the labor of others, you are shameless
beggars.</q> And yet how many meek and humble monks there
are, yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace! These are
less noticed, or passed over in silence. And how surprised men would
be if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitary
prayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more!
For they are in truth made ready in peace and quiet <q>for the day
and the hour, the month and the year.</q> Meanwhile, in their solitude,
they keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled, in the purity
of God's truth, from the times of the Fathers of old, the Apostles
and the martyrs. And when the time comes they will show it to
<pb n='348'/><anchor id='Pg348'/>
the tottering creeds of the world. That is a great thought. That
star will rise out of the East.
</p>

<p>
That is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud?
Look at the worldly and all who set themselves up above the people
of God, has not God's image and His truth been distorted in them?
They have science; but in science there is nothing but what is the
object of sense. The spiritual world, the higher part of man's being
is rejected altogether, dismissed with a sort of triumph, even with
hatred. The world has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially
of late, but what do we see in this freedom of theirs? Nothing but
slavery and self-destruction! For the world says:
</p>

<p>
<q>You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same
rights as the most rich and powerful. Don't be afraid of satisfying
them and even multiply your desires.</q> That is the modern doctrine
of the world. In that they see freedom. And what follows from
this right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and
spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been
given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their
wants. They maintain that the world is getting more and more
united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as
it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.
</p>

<p>
Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom
as the multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort
their own nature, for many senseless and foolish desires and
habits and ridiculous fancies are fostered in them. They live only
for mutual envy, for luxury and ostentation. To have dinners,
visits, carriages, rank and slaves to wait on one is looked upon as
a necessity, for which life, honor and human feeling are sacrificed,
and men even commit suicide if they are unable to satisfy it. We
see the same thing among those who are not rich, while the poor
drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness. But
soon they will drink blood instead of wine, they are being led on to
it. I ask you is such a man free? I knew one <q>champion of freedom</q>
who told me himself that, when he was deprived of tobacco
in prison, he was so wretched at the privation that he almost went
and betrayed his cause for the sake of getting tobacco again! And
such a man says, <q>I am fighting for the cause of humanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
How can such a one fight? what is he fit for? He is capable perhaps
<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>
of some action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long. And
it's no wonder that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into
slavery, and instead of serving the cause of brotherly love and the
union of humanity have fallen, on the contrary, into dissension and
isolation, as my mysterious visitor and teacher said to me in my
youth. And therefore the idea of the service of humanity, of
brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, is more and more
dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimes treated with
derision. For how can a man shake off his habits? What can become
of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable
desires he has created for himself? He is isolated, and what
concern has he with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded in
accumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world
has grown less.
</p>

<p>
The monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and
prayer are laughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real,
true freedom. I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I
subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and
with God's help I attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy.
Which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it&mdash;the
rich man in his isolation or the man who has freed himself from
the tyranny of material things and habits? The monk is reproached
for his solitude, <q>You have secluded yourself within the walls of the
monastery for your own salvation, and have forgotten the brotherly
service of humanity!</q> But we shall see which will be most
zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but they,
who are in isolation, though they don't see that. Of old, leaders
of the people came from among us, and why should they not again?
The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work
for the great cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people.
And the Russian monk has always been on the side of the people.
We are isolated only if the people are isolated. The people believe
as we do, and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in
Russia, even if he is sincere in heart and a genius. Remember that!
The people will meet the atheist and overcome him, and Russia will
be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant and guard his heart.
Go on educating him quietly. That's your duty as monks, for the
peasant has God in his heart.

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>f</hi>) <hi rend='italic'>Of Masters and Servants, and of whether
it is possible for them to be Brothers in the Spirit</hi>
</p>

<p>
Of course, I don't deny that there is sin in the peasants too.
And the fire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from
above downwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people
too. Money-lenders and devourers of the commune are rising
up. Already the merchant grows more and more eager for rank,
and strives to show himself cultured though he has not a trace of
culture, and to this end meanly despises his old traditions, and is
even ashamed of the faith of his fathers. He visits princes, though
he is only a peasant corrupted. The peasants are rotting in drunkenness
and cannot shake off the habit. And what cruelty to their
wives, to their children even! All from drunkenness! I've seen
in the factories children of nine years old, frail, rickety, bent and
already depraved. The stuffy workshop, the din of machinery, work
all day long, the vile language and the drink, the drink&mdash;is that
what a little child's heart needs? He needs sunshine, childish play,
good examples all about him, and at least a little love. There must
be no more of this, monks, no more torturing of children, rise up
and preach that, make haste, make haste!
</p>

<p>
But God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted
and cannot renounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by
God and that they do wrong in sinning. So that our people still
believe in righteousness, have faith in God and weep tears of
devotion.
</p>

<p>
It is different with the upper classes. They, following science,
want to base justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before,
and they have already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there
is no sin. And that's consistent, for if you have no God what is the
meaning of crime? In Europe the people are already rising up
against the rich with violence, and the leaders of the people are
everywhere leading them to bloodshed, and teaching them that their
wrath is righteous. But their <q>wrath is accursed, for it is cruel.</q>
But God will save Russia as He has saved her many times. Salvation
will come from the people, from their faith and their meekness.
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, watch over the people's faith and this will
<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/>
not be a dream. I've been struck all my life in our great people by
their dignity, their true and seemly dignity. I've seen it myself,
I can testify to it, I've seen it and marveled at it, I've seen it in spite
of the degraded sins and poverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry.
They are not servile, and even after two centuries of serfdom
they are free in manner and bearing, yet without insolence,
and not revengeful and not envious. <q>You are rich and noble, you
are clever and talented, well, be so, God bless you. I respect you,
but I know that I too am a man. By the very fact that I respect
you without envy I prove my dignity as a man.</q>
</p>

<p>
In truth if they don't say this (for they don't know how to say
this yet), that is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have known
it myself, and, would you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant
is, the more noticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among
them are for the most part corrupted already, and much of that
is due to our carelessness and indifference. But God will save His
people, for Russia is great in her humility. I dream of seeing, and
seem to see clearly already, our future. It will come to pass, that
even the most corrupt of our rich will end by being ashamed of his
riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing his humility, will understand
and give way before him, will respond joyfully and kindly
to his honorable shame. Believe me that it will end in that; things
are moving to that. Equality is to be found only in the spiritual
dignity of man, and that will only be understood among us. If we
were brothers, there would be fraternity, but before that, they will
never agree about the division of wealth. We preserve the image
of Christ, and it will shine forth like a precious diamond to the
whole world. So may it be, so may it be!
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my
wanderings I met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It
was eight years since I had parted from him. He chanced to see
me in the market-place, recognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted
he was! He simply pounced on me: <q>Master dear, is it you?
Is it really you I see?</q> He took me home with him.
</p>

<p>
He was no longer in the army, he was married and already
had two little children. He and his wife earned their living as
costermongers in the market-place. His room was poor, but bright
and clean. He made me sit down, set the samovar, sent for his
<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>
wife, as though my appearance were a festival for them. He
brought me his children: <q>Bless them, Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will
pray for them. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed
every day since that day, for it all came from you,</q> said I. And I
explained that to him as well as I could. And what do you think?
The man kept gazing at me and could not believe that I, his former
master, an officer, was now before him in such a guise and position;
it made him shed tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you weeping?</q> said I, <q>better rejoice over me, dear
friend, whom I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful
one.</q>
</p>

<p>
He did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head
over me tenderly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What has became of your fortune?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I gave it to the monastery,</q> I answered; <q>we live in common.</q>
</p>

<p>
After tea I began saying good-by, and suddenly he brought out
half a rouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half-rouble
I saw him thrusting hurriedly into my hand: <q>That's for
you in your wanderings, it may be of use to you, Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
I took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out
rejoicing. And on my way I thought: <q>Here we are both now,
he at home and I on the road, sighing and shaking our heads, no
doubt, and yet smiling joyfully in the gladness of our hearts, remembering
how God brought about our meeting.</q>
</p>

<p>
I have never seen him again since then. I had been his master
and he my servant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with
softened hearts, there was a great human bond between us. I have
thought a great deal about that, and now what I think is this: Is
it so inconceivable that that grand and simple-hearted unity might
in due time become universal among the Russian people? I believe
that it will come to pass and that the time is at hand.
</p>

<p>
And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young
I was often angry with servants; <q>the cook had served something
too hot, the orderly had not brushed my clothes.</q> But what taught
me better then was a thought of my dear brother's, which I had
heard from him in childhood: <q>Am I worth it, that another should
serve me and be ordered about by me in his poverty and ignorance?</q>
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>
And I wondered at the time that such simple and self-evident ideas
should be so slow to occur to our minds.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world,
but act so that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were
not a servant. And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and
even let him see it, and that without any pride on my part or any
mistrust on his? Why should not my servant be like my own kindred,
so that I may take him into my family and rejoice in doing so?
Even now this can be done, but it will lead to the grand unity of
men in the future, when a man will not seek servants for himself, or
desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he does now, but
on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be the servant
of all, as the Gospel teaches.
</p>

<p>
And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy only
in deeds of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in
gluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of
one with the other? I firmly believe that it is not and that the
time is at hand. People laugh and ask: <q>When will that time come
and does it look like coming?</q> I believe that with Christ's help
we shall accomplish this great thing. And how many ideas there
have been on earth in the history of man which were unthinkable
ten years before they appeared! Yet when their destined hour had
come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth. So it will
be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world, and all men
will say: <q>The stone which the builders rejected has become the corner-stone
of the building.</q>
</p>

<p>
And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream,
when will you build up your edifice and order things justly by
your intellect alone, without Christ? If they declare that it is they
who are advancing towards unity, only the most simple-hearted
among them believe it, so that one may positively marvel at such
simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic dreams than we.
They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by flooding
the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that
taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not
for Christ's covenant, they would slaughter one another down to
the last two men on earth. And those two last men would not be
able to restrain each other in their pride, and the one would slay the
<pb n='354'/><anchor id='Pg354'/>
other and then himself. And that would come to pass, were it not
for the promise of Christ that for the sake of the humble and meek
the days shall be shortened.
</p>

<p>
While I was still wearing an officer's uniform after my duel, I
talked about servants in general society, and I remember every one
was amazed at me. <q>What!</q> they asked, <q>are we to make our
servants sit down on the sofa and offer them tea?</q> And I answered
them: <q>Why not, sometimes at least?</q> Every one laughed. Their
question was frivolous and my answer was not clear; but the thought
in it was to some extent right.

(<hi rend='italic'>g</hi>) <hi rend='italic'>Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with
other Worlds</hi>
</p>

<p>
Young man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if
your prayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in
it, which will give you fresh courage, and you will understand that
prayer is an education. Remember, too, every day, and whenever
you can, repeat to yourself, <q>Lord, have mercy on all who appear
before Thee to-day.</q> For every hour and every moment thousands
of men leave life on this earth, and their souls appear before God.
And how many of them depart in solitude, unknown, sad, dejected
that no one mourns for them or even knows whether they have lived
or not! And behold, from the other end of the earth perhaps, your
prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew them not
nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread
before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one
to pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too!
And God will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had
so much pity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely
more loving and merciful than you! And He will forgive him for
your sake.
</p>

<p>
Brothers, have no fear of men's sin. Love a man even in his sin,
for that is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on
earth. Love all God's creation, the whole and every grain of sand
in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's light. Love the animals,
love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will
perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you
will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come
<pb n='355'/><anchor id='Pg355'/>
at last to love the whole world with an all-embracing love. Love
the animals: God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy
untroubled. Do not trouble it, don't harass them, don't deprive
them of their happiness, don't work against God's intent. Man, do
not pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without
sin, and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance
on it, and leave the traces of your foulness after you&mdash;alas, it is
true of almost every one of us! Love children especially, for they
too are sinless like the angels; they live to soften and purify our
hearts and as it were to guide us. Woe to him who offends a child!
Father Anfim taught me to love children. The kind, silent man
used often on our wanderings to spend the farthings given us on
sweets and cakes for the children. He could not pass by a child
without emotion. That's the nature of the man.
</p>

<p>
At some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight
of men's sin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble
love. Always decide to use humble love. If you resolve on that
once for all, you may subdue the whole world. Loving humility is
marvelously strong, the strongest of all things, and there is nothing
else like it.
</p>

<p>
Every day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and
watch yourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass
by a little child, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful
heart; you may not have noticed the child, but he has seen you,
and your image, unseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless
heart. You don't know it, but you may have sown an evil seed in
him and it may grow, and all because you were not careful before
the child, because you did not foster in yourself a careful, actively
benevolent love. Brothers, love is a teacher; but one must know
how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire, it is dearly bought, it is
won slowly by long labor. For we must love not only occasionally,
for a moment, but for ever. Every one can love occasionally, even
the wicked can.
</p>

<p>
My brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless,
but it is right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending;
a touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth.
It may be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would
be happier at your side&mdash;a little happier, anyway&mdash;and children and
<pb n='356'/><anchor id='Pg356'/>
all animals, if you were nobler than you are now. It's all like an
ocean, I tell you. Then you would pray to the birds too, consumed
by an all-embracing love, in a sort of transport, and pray that they
too will forgive you your sin. Treasure this ecstasy, however senseless
it may seem to men.
</p>

<p>
My friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the
birds of heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your
doings. Fear not that it will wear away your work and hinder its
being accomplished. Do not say, <q>Sin is mighty, wickedness is
mighty, evil environment is mighty, and we are lonely and helpless,
and evil environment is wearing us away and hindering our good
work from being done.</q> Fly from that dejection, children! There
is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and make yourself
responsible for all men's sins, that is the truth, you know, friends,
for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for everything
and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, and that you
are to blame for every one and for all things. But throwing your
own indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the
pride of Satan and murmuring against God.
</p>

<p>
Of the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on
earth to comprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error
and to share it, even imagining that we are doing something grand
and fine. Indeed, many of the strongest feelings and movements of
our nature we cannot comprehend on earth. Let not that be a
stumbling-block, and think not that it may serve as a justification
to you for anything. For the Eternal Judge asks of you what you
can comprehend and not what you cannot. You will know that
yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then and will
not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are as it were astray, and
if it were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should
be undone and altogether lost, as was the human race before the
flood. Much on earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that
we have been given a precious mystic sense of our living bond with
the other world, with the higher heavenly world, and the roots of
our thoughts and feelings are not here but in other worlds. That is
why the philosophers say that we cannot apprehend the reality of
things on earth.
</p>

<p>
God took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this
<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>
earth, and His garden grew up and everything came up that could
come up, but what grows lives and is alive only through the feeling
of its contact with other mysterious worlds. If that feeling grows
weak or is destroyed in you, the heavenly growth will die away in
you. Then you will be indifferent to life and even grow to hate it.
That's what I think.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End</hi>
</p>

<p>
Remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one.
For no one can judge a criminal, until he recognizes that he is just
such a criminal as the man standing before him, and that he perhaps
is more than all men to blame for that crime. When he understands
that, he will be able to be a judge. Though that sounds
absurd, it is true. If I had been righteous myself, perhaps there
would have been no criminal standing before me. If you can take
upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is judging, take
it at once, suffer for him yourself, and let him go without reproach.
And even if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the same spirit
so far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself more
bitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away untouched,
mocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to
you. It shows his time has not yet come, but it will come in due
course. And if it come not, no matter; if not he, then another in
his place will understand and suffer, and judge and condemn himself,
and the truth will be fulfilled. Believe that, believe it without
doubt; for in that lies all the hope and faith of the saints.
</p>

<p>
Work without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go
to sleep, <q>I have not done what I ought to have done,</q> rise up at
once and do it. If the people around you are spiteful and callous
and will not hear you, fall down before them and beg their forgiveness;
for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear
you. And if you cannot speak to them in their bitterness, serve
them in silence and in humility, never losing hope. If all men
abandon you and even drive you away by force, then when you are
left alone fall on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tears and
it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you
in your solitude. Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and
<pb n='358'/><anchor id='Pg358'/>
you were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then
and praise God in your loneliness. And if two of you are gathered
together&mdash;then there is a whole world, a world of living love. Embrace
each other tenderly and praise God, for if only in you two
His truth has been fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
If you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or
for your sudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous
man, rejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and has not
sinned.
</p>

<p>
If the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming
distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers,
shun above all things that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering
for yourself, as though you were yourself guilty of that wrong.
Accept that suffering and bear it and your heart will find comfort,
and you will understand that you too are guilty, for you might have
been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one man sinless, and you
were not a light to them. If you had been a light, you would have
lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer might perhaps
have been saved by your light from his sin. And even though your
light was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm
and doubt not the power of the heavenly light. Believe that if they
were not saved, they will be saved hereafter. And if they are not
saved hereafter, then their sons will be saved, for your light will
not die even when you are dead. The righteous man departs, but
his light remains. Men are always saved after the death of the
deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay them, but they love
their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain. You are
working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Seek no
reward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy
which is only vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great
nor the mighty, but be wise and ever serene. Know the measure,
know the times, study that. When you are left alone, pray. Love
to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it. Kiss the earth and love
it with an unceasing, consuming love. Love all men, love everything.
Seek that rapture and ecstasy. Water the earth with the
tears of your joy and love those tears. Don't be ashamed of that
ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not
given to many but only to the elect.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection</hi>
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, I ponder, <q>What is hell?</q> I maintain that
it is the suffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence,
immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given
on his coming to earth, the power of saying, <q>I am and I love.</q>
Once, only once, there was given him a moment of active <emph>living</emph>
love, and for that was earthly life given him, and with it times and
seasons. And that happy creature rejected the priceless gift, prized
it and loved it not, scorned it and remained callous. Such a one,
having left the earth, sees Abraham's bosom and talks with Abraham
as we are told in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, and beholds
heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that is just his torment,
to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to be brought
close to those who have loved when he has despised their love. For
he sees clearly and says to himself, <q>Now I have understanding, and
though I now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice
in my love, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come
even with a drop of living water (that is the gift of earthly active
life) to cool the fiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now,
though I despised it on earth; there is no more life for me and will
be no more time! Even though I would gladly give my life for
others, it can never be, for that life is passed which can be sacrificed
for love, and now there is a gulf fixed between that life and this
existence.</q>
</p>

<p>
They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don't go into that
mystery and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material
sense, they would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material
agony, their still greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a
moment. Moreover, that spiritual agony cannot be taken from
them, for that suffering is not external but within them. And if it
could be taken from them, I think it would be bitterer still for the
unhappy creatures. For even if the righteous in Paradise forgave
them, beholding their torments, and called them up to heaven in
their infinite love, they would only multiply their torments, for they
would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst for responsive,
active and grateful love which is now impossible. In the
<pb n='360'/><anchor id='Pg360'/>
timidity of my heart I imagine, however, that the very recognition
of this impossibility would serve at last to console them. For accepting
the love of the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying
it, by this submissiveness and the effect of this humility, they
will attain at last, as it were, to a certain semblance of that active
love which they scorned in life, to something like its outward expression....
I am sorry, friends and brothers, that I cannot express
this clearly. But woe to those who have slain themselves on earth,
woe to the suicides! I believe that there can be none more miserable
then they. They tell us that it is a sin to pray for them and outwardly
the Church, as it were, renounces them, but in my secret
heart I believe that we may pray even for them. Love can never be
an offense to Christ. For such as those I have prayed inwardly all
my life, I confess it, fathers and teachers, and even now I pray
for them every day.
</p>

<p>
Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in
spite of their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute
truth; there are some fearful ones who have given themselves over
to Satan and his proud spirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary
and ever consuming; they are tortured by their own choice. For
they have cursed themselves, cursing God and life. They live upon
their vindictive pride like a starving man in the desert sucking blood
out of his own body. But they are never satisfied, and they refuse
forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. They cannot behold
the living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God of
life should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His
own creation. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath
for ever and yearn for death and annihilation. But they will not
attain to death....

The elder's death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although
those who were gathered about him that last evening realized
that his death was approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that
it would come so suddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed
already, seeing him that night apparently so cheerful and
talkative, were convinced that there was at least a temporary change
for the better in his condition. Even five minutes before his death,
they said afterwards wonderingly, it was impossible to foresee it.
He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his chest, he turned
pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose from their seats
and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at them
with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed
his face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful
ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave
up his soul to God.
</p>

<p>
The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and
reached the monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and
those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the
corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered
together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death
reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the
event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery.
But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here
that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so
strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and
the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense
is still vividly remembered in the town.

<p>
The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according
to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead
monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church
Ritual: <q>If any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk
designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm
water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead
of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on
the knees, and that is enough.</q> All this was done by Father Païssy,
who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him
in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow
of its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head
he put a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open
and the dead man's face was covered with black gauze. In his hands
was put an ikon of the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in
the coffin which had been made ready long before. It was decided
to leave the coffin all day in the cell, in the larger room in which the
elder used to receive his visitors and fellow monks. As the deceased
was a priest and monk of the strictest rule, the Gospel, not the
Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks in holy orders. The
reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after the requiem
service. Father Païssy desired later on to read the Gospel all day
and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as the
Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied,
for something extraordinary, an unheard-of, even <q>unseemly</q>
excitement and impatient expectation began to be apparent in the
<pb n='363'/><anchor id='Pg363'/>
monks, and the visitors from the monastery hostels, and the crowds
of people flocking from the town. And as time went on, this grew
more and more marked. Both the Superintendent and Father Païssy
did their utmost to calm the general bustle and agitation.
</p>

<p>
When it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick,
in most cases children, with them from the town&mdash;as though they
had been waiting expressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded
that the dead elder's remains had a power of healing, which
would be immediately made manifest in accordance with their faith.
It was only then apparent how unquestionably every one in our
town had accepted Father Zossima during his lifetime as a great
saint. And those who came were far from being all of the humbler
classes.
</p>

<p>
This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with
such haste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence,
impressed Father Païssy as unseemly. Though he had long
foreseen something of the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling
was beyond anything he had looked for. When he came across
any of the monks who displayed this excitement, Father Païssy
began to reprove them. <q>Such immediate expectation of something
extraordinary,</q> he said, <q>shows a levity, possible to worldly people
but unseemly in us.</q>
</p>

<p>
But little attention was paid him and Father Païssy noticed it
uneasily. Yet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly
at the bottom of his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and
could not but be aware of it, though he was indignant at the too
impatient expectation around him, and saw in it light-mindedness
and vanity. Nevertheless, it was particularly unpleasant to him to
meet certain persons, whose presence aroused in him great misgivings.
In the crowd in the dead man's cell he noticed with inward aversion
(for which he immediately reproached himself) the presence of
Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was still staying in the
monastery. Of both of them Father Païssy felt for some reason
suddenly suspicious&mdash;though, indeed, he might well have felt the
same about others.
</p>

<p>
The monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in
the excited crowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he
was asking questions, everywhere he was listening, on all sides he was
<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>
whispering with a peculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed
the greatest impatience and even a sort of irritation.
</p>

<p>
As for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the
hermitage at the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon
as that good-hearted but weak-minded woman, who could not herself
have been admitted to the hermitage, waked and heard of the
death of Father Zossima, she was overtaken with such intense
curiosity that she promptly dispatched Rakitin to the hermitage,
to keep a careful look out and report to her by letter every half-hour
or so <q><emph>everything that takes place</emph>.</q> She regarded Rakitin as a most
religious and devout young man. He was particularly clever in
getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most
to their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from
doing so.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging
about the tombs, which were particularly numerous round the
church and scattered here and there about the hermitage. As he
walked round the hermitage, Father Païssy remembered Alyosha and
that he had not seen him for some time, not since the night. And
he had no sooner thought of him than he at once noticed him in the
farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting on the tombstone
of a monk who had been famous long ago for his saintliness. He sat
with his back to the hermitage and his face to the wall, and seemed
to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him, Father Païssy
saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his face hidden
in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs. Father
Païssy stood over him for a little.
</p>

<p>
<q>Enough, dear son, enough, dear,</q> he pronounced with feeling at
last. <q>Why do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don't you know
that this is the greatest of his days? Think only where he is now,
at this moment!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen
with crying like a child's, but turned away at once without uttering
a word and hid his face in his hands again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Maybe it is well,</q> said Father Païssy thoughtfully; <q>weep if you
must, Christ has sent you those tears.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will
serve to gladden your dear heart,</q> he added to himself, walking away
<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>
from Alyosha, and thinking lovingly of him. He moved away
quickly, however, for he felt that he too might weep looking at him.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the
requiems for the dead followed in their due course. Father Païssy
again took Father Iosif's place by the coffin and began reading the
Gospel. But before three o'clock in the afternoon that something
took place to which I alluded at the end of the last book, something
so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general hope,
