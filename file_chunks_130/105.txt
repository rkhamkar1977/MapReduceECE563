Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<head>Chapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov</head>

<p>
Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son
of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known
in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing
to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago,
and which I shall describe in its proper place. For the present I
will only say that this <q>landowner</q>&mdash;for so we used to call him,
although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate&mdash;was a
strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject
and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those
senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their
worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,
for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of
the smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on
them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred
thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life
one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district.
I repeat, it was not stupidity&mdash;the majority of these fantastical fellows
are shrewd and intelligent enough&mdash;but just senselessness, and
a peculiar national form of it.
</p>

<p>
He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by
his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor
Pavlovitch's first wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly
rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district,
the Miüsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also
a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so
<pb n='002'/><anchor id='Pg002'/>
common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the
last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all
called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the
last <q>romantic</q> generation who after some years of an enigmatic
passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have married
at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and
ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and
rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished,
entirely to satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's
Ophelia. Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers,
had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in
its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place.
This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar
instances in the last two or three generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna
Miüsov's action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's
ideas, and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom.
She wanted, perhaps, to show her feminine independence, to
override class distinctions and the despotism of her family. And a
pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for a brief
moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic position,
was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch,
though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.
What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an
elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna's fancy.
Fyodor Pavlovitch's position at the time made him specially eager
for any such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a
career in one way or another. To attach himself to a good family
and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love
it did not exist apparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite
of Adelaïda Ivanovna's beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of
the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a
voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on the
slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman
who made no particular appeal to his senses.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned
in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt.
The marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with
extraordinary rapidity. Although the family accepted the event
<pb n='003'/><anchor id='Pg003'/>
pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the
husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there
were everlasting scenes between them. It was said that the young
wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fyodor
Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up
to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that
those thousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the
rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his
utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by means of some
deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded, merely
from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from the
contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless
importunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda Ivanovna's family intervened
and circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact
that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but
rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but
was beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed,
impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally,
she left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a
destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old,
in her husband's hands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced
a regular harem into the house, and abandoned himself to orgies of
drunkenness. In the intervals he used to drive all over the province,
complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaïda Ivanovna's having
left him, going into details too disgraceful for a husband to
mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to gratify
him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part
of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.
</p>

<p>
<q>One would think that you'd got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,</q> scoffers said
to him. Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part
in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it
funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position.
But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last he succeeded
in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor woman
turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity
student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete
emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about,
<pb n='004'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>
making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could
not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but
having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself
for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just
at that time his wife's family received the news of her death in
Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to
one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation.
Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife's death, and
the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with
joy, raising his hands to Heaven: <q>Lord, now lettest Thou Thy
servant depart in peace,</q> but others say he wept without restraint
like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in
spite of the repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions
were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time
wept for her who released him. As a general rule, people, even the
wicked, are much more naïve and simple-hearted than we suppose.
And we ourselves are, too.

<head>Chapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son</head>

<p>
You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and
how he would bring up his children. His behavior as a father
was exactly what might be expected. He completely abandoned the
child of his marriage with Adelaïda Ivanovna, not from malice,
nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but simply because he
forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his tears and
complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful
servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya
into his care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been
no one even to change the baby's little shirt.
</p>

<p>
It happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's
side forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living,
his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was
seriously ill, while his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained
for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived
<pb n='005'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>
with him in the servant's cottage. But if his father had remembered
him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether unaware of his
existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as the child
would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a cousin
of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, happened to return
from Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but
was at that time quite a young man, and distinguished among the
Miüsovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture,
who had been in the capitals and abroad. Towards the end of his
life he became a Liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties.
In the course of his career he had come into contact with
many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and
abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in
his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the
Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had
almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one
of the most grateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent
property of about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old
style. His splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and
bordered on the lands of our famous monastery, with which Pyotr
Alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit, almost as soon as he
came into the estate, concerning the rights of fishing in the river or
wood-cutting in the forest, I don't know exactly which. He regarded
it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an
attack upon the <q>clericals.</q> Hearing all about Adelaïda Ivanovna,
whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time
been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened,
in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He made the latter's acquaintance for the first
time, and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child's
education. He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch,
that when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked
for some time as though he did not understand what child he was
talking about, and even as though he was surprised to hear that he
had a little son in the house. The story may have been exaggerated,
yet it must have been something like the truth.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly
playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing
<pb n='006'/><anchor id='Pg006'/>
so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance,
in the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very
great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like
Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business
through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch,
joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and
land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this
cousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and
after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at
once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady
living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in
Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of
February broke out, making an impression on his mind that he remembered
all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya
passed into the care of one of her married daughters. I believe
he changed his home a fourth time later on. I won't enlarge upon
that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch's
firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts
about him, without which I could not begin my story.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was
the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in the
belief that he had property, and that he would be independent on
coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did
not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school,
then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was
degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and
spent a good deal of money. He did not begin to receive any income
from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then
got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for
the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood
on purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to
have liked his father. He did not stay long with him, and made
haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of
money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from
the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact
worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his
father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this,
too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea
<pb n='007'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>
of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with
this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the
young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient,
and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he
would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So
Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending
him from time to time small doles, installments. In the end, when
four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our
little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out
to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get
an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property
in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even
in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of
his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right
to expect anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man
was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost
beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe,
the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory
story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass
to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's other two
sons, and of their origin.

<head>Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family</head>

<p>
Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands
Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage
lasted eight years. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also
a very young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon
some small piece of business in company with a Jew. Though
Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he
never neglected investing his capital, and managed his business
affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over-scrupulously.
Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was
left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up
in the house of a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position,
<pb n='008'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>
who was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not
know the details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a
meek and gentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in
which she was hanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her
sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old
woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an
insufferable tyrant through idleness.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about
him and he was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed
an elopement to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt
that she would not on any account have married him if she had
known a little more about him in time. But she lived in another
province; besides, what could a little girl of sixteen know about it,
except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than
remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child exchanged a
benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a
penny this time, for the general's widow was furious. She gave
them nothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on
a dowry; what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent
girl, above all her innocent appearance, which had a peculiar
attraction for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only
the coarser types of feminine beauty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,</q> he used to say
afterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this
might, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had
received no dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her
<q>from the halter,</q> he did not stand on ceremony with her. Making
her feel that she had <q>wronged</q> him, he took advantage of her
phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary
decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women into his
house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife's presence.
To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that
Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who
had always hated his first mistress, Adelaïda Ivanovna, took the
side of his new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor
Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion
broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of
the house. In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror
<pb n='009'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>
from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is
most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be <q>possessed
by devils.</q> At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even
lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan
and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second
three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth
year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother
all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the
same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother,
Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their
father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in
his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who
had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all
those eight years, forgotten the insult done her. All that time she
was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya's manner of life,
and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared
aloud two or three times to her retainers:
</p>

<p>
<q>It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.</q>
</p>

<p>
Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna's death the general's
widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she
did a great deal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had
not seen for those eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is
that instantly upon seeing him, without any sort of explanation, she
gave him two good, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by a
tuft of hair, and shook him three times up and down. Then, without
a word, she went straight to the cottage to the two boys.
Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in dirty
linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and announcing
that she would carry off both the children she wrapped
them just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove
off to her own town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted
slave, without a word, and when he escorted the old lady to her
carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that,
<q>God would repay her for the orphans.</q> <q>You are a blockhead all
the same,</q> the old lady shouted to him as she drove away.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good
thing, and did not refuse the general's widow his formal consent to
<pb n='010'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>
any proposition in regard to his children's education. As for the
slaps she had given him, he drove all over the town telling the story.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left
the boys in her will a thousand roubles each <q>for their instruction,
and so that all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition
that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it
is more than adequate provision for such children. If other people
think fit to throw away their money, let them.</q> I have not read
the will myself, but I heard there was something queer of the sort,
very whimsically expressed. The principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch
Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the province, turned out, however,
to be an honest man. Writing to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and
discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him for
his children's education (though the latter never directly refused
but only procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was,
indeed, at times effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a
personal interest in the orphans. He became especially fond of the
younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as one of his family.
I beg the reader to note this from the beginning. And to Yefim
Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met
with, the young people were more indebted for their education and
bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand roubles
left to them by the general's widow intact, so that by the time they
came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation
of interest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly
spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them.
I won't enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth,
but will only mention a few of the most important events. Of the
elder, Ivan, I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose
and reserved, though far from timid boy. At ten years old he
had realized that they were living not in their own home but on
other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it
was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his
infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude
for learning. I don't know precisely why, but he left the
family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering
a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated
teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to
<pb n='011'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>
declare afterwards that this was all due to the <q>ardor for good
works</q> of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that
the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But
neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young
man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As
Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the
tyrannical old lady's legacy, which had grown from one thousand to
two, it was delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and
the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the
university, as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was
studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate
with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for
him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that
from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that
may have been, the young man was by no means despondent and
succeeded in getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and
afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers
under the signature of <q>Eye-Witness.</q> These paragraphs,
it was said, were so interesting and piquant that they were soon
taken. This alone showed the young man's practical and intellectual
superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of
both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals,
unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for
copying and translations from the French. Having once got into
touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept up his connection
with them, and in his latter years at the university he published
brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so
that he became well known in literary circles. But only in his
last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a
far wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and
remembered him. It was rather a curious incident. When he had
just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two
thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more
important journals a strange article, which attracted general notice,
on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing,
as he was a student of natural science. The article dealt with
a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time&mdash;the
position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions
<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>
on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was
most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected
conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly
as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even
atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons
opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical
burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article
penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where
the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the
ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning
the author's name, they were interested in his being a native of
the town and the son of <q>that Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q> And just then
it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.
</p>

<p>
Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking
myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit,
which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never
fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that
a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious,
should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had
ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him,
and would not under any circumstances have given him money,
though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would
also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying
in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two
months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact
was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me.
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, of whom we have spoken already,
the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, happened to be in the
neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had come from
Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was
more surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the
young man, who interested him extremely, and with whom he
sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself
in acquirements.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is proud,</q> he used to say, <q>he will never be in want of pence;
he has got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want
here? Every one can see that he hasn't come for money, for his
father would never give him any. He has no taste for drink and
<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>
dissipation, and yet his father can't do without him. They get on
so well together!</q>
</p>

<p>
That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence
over his father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently
and even seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often
extremely and even spitefully perverse.
</p>

<p>
It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at
the request of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri,
whom he saw for the first time on this very visit, though he had
before leaving Moscow been in correspondence with him about an
important matter of more concern to Dmitri than himself. What
that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even
when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan
Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather
mysterious.
</p>

<p>
I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a
mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was
in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action
against him.
</p>

<p>
The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some
of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger
brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been
the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find
it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give
some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact,
which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing
the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been for the last year in our
monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest
of his life.
</p>

<head>Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha</head>

<p>
He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth
year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven.
First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha,
was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning.
He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the
monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to
say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of
worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason this life
struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as he
thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to
whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent
heart. But I do not dispute that he was very strange even at that
time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I have mentioned
already, by the way, that though he lost his mother in his fourth
year he remembered her all his life&mdash;her face, her caresses, <q>as though
she stood living before me.</q> Such memories may persist, as every
one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but
scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out
of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all
faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was
with him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open
window, the slanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most
vividly of all); in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a
lighted lamp, and on her knees before the image his mother, sobbing
hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him up in both arms,
squeezing him close till it hurt, and praying for him to the Mother
of God, holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put
him under the Mother's protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs
in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the picture!
And Alyosha remembered his mother's face at that minute. He used
to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he
rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood
and youth he was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed,
but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary,
from something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely
personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important to
him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it.
But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life to put
implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton
or naïve person. There was something about him which made
one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
not care to be a judge of others&mdash;that he would never take it upon
himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything.
He seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation
though often grieving bitterly: and this was so much
so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest
youth. Coming at twenty to his father's house, which was a very
sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste and pure as he was, simply
withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable, but without
the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation. His father, who
had once been in a dependent position, and so was sensitive and
ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and sullenness.
<q>He does not say much,</q> he used to say, <q>and thinks the more.</q>
But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and
kissing him terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality,
yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him,
such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one before.
</p>

<p>
Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and
it was so from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household
of his patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he
gained the hearts of all the family, so that they looked on him quite
as their own child. Yet he entered the house at such a tender age
that he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning
affection. So that the gift of making himself loved directly and
unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very nature, so to speak.
It was the same at school, though he seemed to be just one of those
children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and even disliked
by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and rather
solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a
corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was
at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see
at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the
contrary he was bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show
off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never
afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that he was
not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was
bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would happen
that an hour after the offense he would address the offender or
answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
though nothing had happened between them. And it was not that
he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront,
but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this completely
conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic
which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the
top want to mock at him, not from malice but because it amused
them. This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity.
He could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations
about women. There are <q>certain</q> words and conversations unhappily
impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure in mind and
heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among themselves,
and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which even
soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much
that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite
young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no
moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is
the appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as
something refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing
that Alyosha Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked
of <q>that,</q> they used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands
away, and shout nastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped
to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of
abuse, enduring their insults in silence. But at last they left him
alone and gave up taunting him with being a <q>regular girl,</q> and
what's more they looked upon it with compassion as a weakness.
He was always one of the best in the class but was never first.
</p>

<p>
At the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more
years to complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable
widow went almost immediately after his death for a long visit to
Italy with her whole family, which consisted only of women and
girls. Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of
Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had never seen before. On what
terms he lived with them he did not know himself. It was very
characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at whose expense
he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to his
elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two
years in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and
had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense
<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>
of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha's character
must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance
with him any one would have perceived that Alyosha
was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious enthusiast,
who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune,
would not hesitate to give it away for the asking, either for
good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he seemed
scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a literal
sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked for,
he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment,
or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
</p>

<p>
In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive
on the score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following
judgment, after getting to know Alyosha:
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might
leave alone without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of
a million inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not
die of cold and hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once;
and if he were not, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would
cost him no effort or humiliation. And to shelter him would be no
burden, but, on the contrary, would probably be looked on as a
pleasure.</q>
</p>

<p>
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before
the end of the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he
was going to see his father about a plan which had occurred to him.
They were sorry and unwilling to let him go. The journey was
not an expensive one, and the ladies would not let him pawn his
watch, a parting present from his benefactor's family. They provided
him liberally with money and even fitted him out with new
clothes and linen. But he returned half the money they gave him,
saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival in the town
he made no answer to his father's first inquiry why he had come
before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually
thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his
mother's tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that
was the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the
whole reason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not
understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
soul, and drawn him irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable
path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him where his second
wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave since he had
thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had entirely
forgotten where she was buried.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not
been living in our town. Three or four years after his wife's death
he had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa,
where he spent several years. He made the acquaintance at first,
in his own words, <q>of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,</q>
and ended by being received by <q>Jews high and low alike.</q> It may
be presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for
making and hoarding money. He finally returned to our town only
three years before Alyosha's arrival. His former acquaintances
found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means an
old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with
more effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity
for making buffoons of others. His depravity with women was
not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting. In a short
time he opened a great number of new taverns in the district. It
was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not
much less. Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were
soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good security. Of late,
too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more
uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing
and go on with another, as though he were letting himself go altogether.
He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had
not been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged
considerably too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like
a tutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.
Alyosha's arrival seemed to affect even his moral side, as though
something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had
long been dead in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know,</q> he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, <q>that
you are like her, <q>the crazy woman</q></q>&mdash;that was what he used to call
his dead wife, Alyosha's mother. Grigory it was who pointed out
the <q>crazy woman's</q> grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town
cemetery and showed him in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone,
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
cheap but decently kept, on which were inscribed the name and
age of the deceased and the date of her death, and below a four-lined
verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class
tombs. To Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be
Grigory's doing. He had put it up on the poor <q>crazy woman's</q>
grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had
often pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the
grave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion
at the sight of his mother's grave. He only listened to Grigory's
minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood
with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word. It was
perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this little
episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch&mdash;and
a very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our
monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for
the second, Alyosha's mother, the <q>crazy woman,</q> but for the
first, Adelaïda Ivanovna, who used to thrash him. In the evening
of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha.
He himself was far from being religious; he had probably never
put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses
of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance
at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably
to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his
little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude
of deep wrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam's apple hung
below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a
peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious
mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little stumps of
black decayed teeth. He slobbered every time he began to speak.
He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face, though, I believe,
he was well satisfied with it. He used particularly to point to
his nose, which was not very large, but very delicate and conspicuously
aquiline. <q>A regular Roman nose,</q> he used to say, <q>with my
goiter I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman patrician of
the decadent period.</q> He seemed proud of it.
</p>

<p>
Not long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly announced
that he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
were willing to receive him as a novice. He explained that this was
his strong desire, and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his
father. The old man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living
in the monastery hermitage, had made a special impression upon
his <q>gentle boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the most honest monk among them, of course,</q> he observed,
after listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming
scarcely surprised at his request. <q>H'm!... So that's where you
want to be, my gentle boy?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken
grin, which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy
slyness. <q>H'm!... I had a presentiment that you would end in
something like this. Would you believe it? You were making
straight for it. Well, to be sure you have your own two thousand.
That's a dowry for you. And I'll never desert you, my angel. And
I'll pay what's wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of
course, if they don't ask, why should we worry them? What do you
say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week.
H'm!... Do you know that near one monastery there's a place
outside the town where every baby knows there are none but <q>the
monks' wives</q> living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe.
I have been there myself. You know, it's interesting in its own
way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it's awfully Russian.
There are no French women there. Of course they could get them
fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it
they'll come along. Well, there's nothing of that sort here, no
<q>monks' wives,</q> and two hundred monks. They're honest. They
keep the fasts. I admit it.... H'm.... So you want to be a
monk? And do you know I'm sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would
you believe it, I've really grown fond of you? Well, it's a good
opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much
here. I've always been thinking who would pray for me, and
whether there's any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I'm
awfully stupid about that. You wouldn't believe it. Awfully.
You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep
thinking&mdash;from time to time, of course, not all the while. It's
impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell
with their hooks when I die. Then I wonder&mdash;hooks? Where would
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do they forge
them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in
the monastery probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance.
Now I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling.
It makes it more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is.
And, after all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't?
But, do you know, there's a damnable question involved in it? If
there's no ceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks
it all breaks down, which is unlikely again, for then there would be
none to drag me down to hell, and if they don't drag me down what
justice is there in the world? <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Il faudrait les
inventer</foreign>, those hooks,
on purpose for me alone, for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a
blackguard I am.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But there are no hooks there,</q> said Alyosha, looking gently and
seriously at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That's
how a Frenchman described hell: <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>J'ai bu l'ombre d'un
cocher qui avec l'ombre d'une brosse frottait l'ombre d'une carrosse.</foreign></q> How do
you know there are no hooks, darling? When you've lived with
the monks you'll sing a different tune. But go and get at the truth
there, and then come and tell me. Anyway it's easier going to the
other world if one knows what there is there. Besides, it will be
more seemly for you with the monks than here with me, with a
drunken old man and young harlots ... though you're like an
angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch
you there. That's why I let you go, because I hope for that.
You've got all your wits about you. You will burn and you will
burn out; you will be healed and come back again. And I will wait
for you. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who has
not condemned me. My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can't help
feeling it.</q>

<head>Chapter V. Elders</head>

<p>
Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a
sickly, ecstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive
dreamer. On the contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well-grown,
red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health. He
was very handsome, too, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a
dark brown, with a regular, rather long, oval-shaped face, and wide-set
dark gray, shining eyes; he was very thoughtful, and apparently
very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red cheeks are not incompatible
with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy that Alyosha
was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the monastery
he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are never
a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose
realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will
always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and
if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would
rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he
admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by
him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the
miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound
by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle
Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did
see he said, <q>My Lord and my God!</q> Was it the miracle forced
him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because he
desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart
even when he said, <q>I do not believe till I see.</q>
</p>

<p>
I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had
not finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies
is true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
I'll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon
this path only because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination
and presented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for
his soul from darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some
extent a youth of our last epoch&mdash;that is, honest in nature, desiring
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
the truth, seeking for it and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at
once with all the strength of his soul, seeking for immediate action,
and ready to sacrifice everything, life itself, for it. Though these
young men unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is,
in many cases, the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for
instance, five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious
study, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth
and the cause they have set before them as their goal&mdash;such a sacrifice
is utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path
Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he
chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he
reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and
immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: <q>I want
to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.</q> In the
same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist,
he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism
is not merely the labor question, it is before all things the atheistic
question, the question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the
question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount
to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth. Alyosha would
have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before. It
is written: <q>Give all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me, if
thou wouldst be perfect.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha said to himself: <q>I can't give two roubles instead of
<q>all,</q> and only go to mass instead of <q>following Him.</q></q> Perhaps his
memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his
mother may have taken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight
and the holy image to which his poor <q>crazy</q> mother had held him
up still acted upon his imagination. Brooding on these things he may
have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice
all or only <q>two roubles,</q> and in the monastery he met this elder.
I must digress to explain what an <q>elder</q> is in Russian monasteries,
and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do so. I will
try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a few words.
Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of <q>elders</q> is
of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries,
though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos, it has
existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook
Russia&mdash;the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations
with the East after the destruction of Constantinople&mdash;this institution
fell into oblivion. It was revived among us towards the end
of last century by one of the great <q>ascetics,</q> as they called him,
Païssy Velitchkovsky, and his disciples. But to this day it exists in
few monasteries only, and has sometimes been almost persecuted as
an innovation in Russia. It flourished especially in the celebrated
Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was introduced into
our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three such
elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying
of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The
question for our monastery was an important one, for it had not
been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they had
neither relics of saints, nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious
traditions, nor historical exploits. It had flourished and been glorious
all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had
flocked for thousands of miles from all parts.
</p>

<p>
What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul,
your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder,
you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission,
complete self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible
school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest,
of self-mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to
attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those
who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves
in themselves. This institution of elders is not founded on theory,
but was established in the East from the practice of a thousand
years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary <q>obedience</q>
which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The
obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted
themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him
and them.
</p>

<p>
The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity
one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon
him by his elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt.
There, after great exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer
torture and a martyr's death for the faith. When the Church, regarding
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
him as a saint, was burying him, suddenly, at the deacon's
exhortation, <q>Depart all ye unbaptized,</q> the coffin containing the
martyr's body left its place and was cast forth from the church,
and this took place three times. And only at last they learnt that
this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and left his elder,
and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder's absolution
in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral take
place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent
instance.
</p>

<p>
A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos,
which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go
first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go
to the north to Siberia: <q>There is the place for thee and not here.</q>
The monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to the Œcumenical
Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him to release him from
his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not only was he unable
to release him, but there was not and could not be on earth a power
which could release him except the elder who had himself laid that
duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases
with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many
of our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to
persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly
esteemed among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well
as men of distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our
monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings,
and ask for counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of
the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being
arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the continual opening
of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing
of the character of the sacrament. In the end, however, the institution
of elders has been retained and is becoming established in
Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this instrument which
had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration
of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may
be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and
complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to
bondage and not to freedom.
</p>

<p>
The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners,
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
had been in the army in early youth, and served in the
Caucasus as an officer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by
some peculiar quality of his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the
elder, who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him. It
must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could
go where he pleased and be absent for whole days. Though he wore
the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others.
No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination was
deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that
so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to
Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing,
that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an
unknown face what a new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering
on his conscience. He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed
his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken
a word.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for
the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with
bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the
fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he
was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more
drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner
the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of
his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they
were few in number and they were silent, though among them were
some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the
older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows
of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima's side and very
many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.
Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though
not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt
of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and
great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics.
Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the
elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin
that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick
children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
and to pray over them, return shortly after&mdash;some the next day&mdash;and,
falling in tears at the elder's feet, thank him for healing their
sick.
</p>

<p>
Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the
natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for
Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher
and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own
triumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over
when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting
crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from
all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing.
They fell down before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed the earth
on which he stood, and wailed, while the women held up their children
to him and brought him the sick <q>possessed with devils.</q>
The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed them,
and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks
of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and
the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha
did not wonder why they loved him so, why they fell down before
him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face. Oh! he
understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant, worn
out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting injustice and
everlasting sin, his own and the world's, it was the greatest need
and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before
and worship.
</p>

<p>
<q>Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere
on earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the
truth; he knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it
will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according to
the promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even
reasoned. He understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this
saint and custodian of God's truth&mdash;of that he had no more doubt
than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their
children to the elder. The conviction that after his death the elder
would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger
in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind of deep flame
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart. He
was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a solitary example
before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of
renewal for all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on
the earth, and all men will be holy and love one another, and there
will be no more rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will
be as the children of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will
come.</q> That was the dream in Alyosha's heart.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till
then, seemed to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more
quickly made friends with his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived
later) than with his own brother Ivan. He was extremely
interested in his brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two
months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were
still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed to be
expecting something, ashamed about something, while his brother
Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and
curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him.
Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his
brother's indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education.
But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and
sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown
to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something&mdash;something
inward and important&mdash;that he was striving
towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was
why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether
there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for
him&mdash;a foolish novice. He knew for certain that his brother was
an atheist. He could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed;
yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand,
he waited for his brother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used
to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar
earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of the important
affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable
bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri's enthusiastic references
to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri
was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be
difficult to find two men more unlike.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the
members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the
elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The
pretext for this gathering was a false one. It was at this time that
the discord between Dmitri and his father seemed at its acutest
stage and their relations had become insufferably strained. Fyodor
Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest, apparently in
joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima's cell, and that,
without appealing to his direct intervention, they might more
decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence
of the elder's presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder,
naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but,
as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his
father on several recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It
must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying with his father,
but living apart at the other end of the town. It happened that
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, who was staying in the district at
the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the forties and fifties,
a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom
or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the
desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with
the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing
the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor
coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more
attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity.
Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the
elder, who of late had scarcely left his cell, and had been forced
by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors. In the end he consented
to see them, and the day was fixed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who has made me a judge over them?</q> was all he said, smilingly,
to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit.
Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one
who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would
come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder.
Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and Miüsov would come from
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be
contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing,
Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was
far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the
day with a heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his
mind how the family discord could be ended. But his chief anxiety
concerned the elder. He trembled for him, for his glory, and
dreaded any affront to him, especially the refined, courteous irony of
Miüsov and the supercilious half-utterances of the highly educated
Ivan. He even wanted to venture on warning the elder, telling him
something about them, but, on second thoughts, said nothing. He
only sent word the day before, through a friend, to his brother
Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep his promise.
Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had promised,
but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let
himself be provoked <q>by vileness,</q> but that, although he had a deep
respect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that
the meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking
in respect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,</q> he
wrote in conclusion. Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.

<head>Chapter I. They Arrive At The Monastery</head>

<p>
It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview
with the elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately
after late mass. Our visitors did not take part in the service, but
arrived just as it was over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn
by two valuable horses, drove up with Miüsov and a distant relative
of his, a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov.
This young man was preparing to enter the university. Miüsov,
with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to persuade him
to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young man
was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He
was nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange
fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he
would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was
silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with
any one, he became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything
or nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared.
He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had
already some independent fortune and expectations of much more.
He was a friend of Alyosha's.
</p>

<p>
In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of
old pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Miüsov's carriage, came
Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though
he had been informed of the time the evening before. The visitors
left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to
the gates of the monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch,
none of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Miüsov had
probably not even been to church for thirty years. He looked
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
about him with curiosity, together with assumed ease. But, except
the church and the domestic buildings, though these too were ordinary
enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the
monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the
church, bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler
people were a few of higher rank&mdash;two or three ladies and a very
old general. They were all staying at the hotel. Our visitors were
at once surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything,
except young Kalganov, who took a ten-copeck piece out of
his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed&mdash;God knows why!&mdash;hurriedly
gave it to an old woman, saying: <q>Divide it equally.</q> None
of his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no
reason to be embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more
overcome.
</p>

<p>
It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that
they were not received with special honor, though one of them had
recently made a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was
a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in
the monastery were in a sense dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit
might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands.
Yet no official personage met them.
</p>

<p>
Miüsov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the
church, and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here
must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this <q>holy
place,</q> but refrained. His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost
into anger.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must
find out, for time is passing,</q> he observed suddenly, as though
speaking to himself.
</p>

<p>
All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating
little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting
his hat, he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a
landowner of Tula. He at once entered into our visitors' difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces
from the monastery, the other side of the copse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it's the other side of the copse,</q> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,
<q>but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since
we've been here.</q>

<p>
<q>This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the
copse. Come with me, won't you? I'll show you. I have to go....
I am going myself. This way, this way.</q>
</p>

<p>
They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov,
a man of sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to
stare at them all, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity.
His eyes looked starting out of his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,</q>
observed Miüsov severely. <q>That personage has granted us an audience,
so to speak, and so, though we thank you for showing us the
way, we cannot ask you to accompany us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been there. I've been already; <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>un
chevalier parfait</foreign>,</q> and
Maximov snapped his fingers in the air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chevalier</foreign>?</q> asked Miüsov.
</p>

<p>
<q>The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory
of the monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!</q>
</p>

<p>
But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking
monk of medium height, wearing a monk's cap, who overtook them.
Fyodor Pavlovitch and Miüsov stopped.
</p>

<p>
The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:
</p>

<p>
<q>The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with
him after your visit to the hermitage. At one o'clock, not later.
And you also,</q> he added, addressing Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I certainly will, without fail,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
hugely delighted at the invitation. <q>And, believe me, we've all
given our word to behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the
customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you suppose
I like all this business, and in your company, too? So we will
come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior,</q> he said to the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,</q> answered
the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior&mdash;to the Father
Superior,</q> babbled Maximov.
</p>

<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>

<p>
<q>The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please&mdash;</q>
the monk hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Impertinent old man!</q> Miüsov observed aloud, while Maximov
ran back to the monastery.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's like von Sohn,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von
Sohn? Have you ever seen von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something indefinable.
He's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the
physiognomy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word
to behave properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself.
But, if you begin to play the fool I don't intend to be associated with
you here.... You see what a man he is</q>&mdash;he turned to the monk&mdash;<q>I'm
afraid to go among decent people with him.</q> A fine smile,
not without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of
the monk, but he made no reply, and was evidently silent from a
sense of his own dignity. Miüsov frowned more than ever.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through
centuries, and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,</q>
flashed through Miüsov's mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here's the hermitage. We've arrived,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<q>The gates are shut.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted
above and on the sides of the gates.
</p>

<p>
<q>When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here
in this hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved. They
look at one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in
at this gate. That's what is remarkable. And that really is so. But
I did hear that the elder receives ladies,</q> he remarked suddenly to
the monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there
waiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built
adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts&mdash;you can see the
windows&mdash;and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when
he is well enough. They are always outside the precincts. There is
a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her sick
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
daughter. Probably he has promised to come out to her, though
of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even
to the people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage
to the ladies. Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean any
harm. But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of
women are not allowed, but no creature of the female sex&mdash;no hens,
nor turkey-hens, nor cows.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you
here. They'll turn you out when I'm gone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,</q>
he cried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, <q>what a vale of
roses they live in!</q>
</p>

<p>
Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and
beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for
them, and evidently tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds
round the church, and between the tombs; and the one-storied
wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.
</p>

<p>
<q>And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy?
He didn't care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and
thrash even ladies with a stick,</q> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he
went up the steps.
</p>

<p>
<q>The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a
great deal that's told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,</q>
answered the monk. <q>Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute
I will announce you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you
hear? Behave properly or I will pay you out!</q> Miüsov had time to
mutter again.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't think why you are so agitated,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch observed
sarcastically. <q>Are you uneasy about your sins? They say
he can tell by one's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot
you think of their opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm
surprised at you.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were
asked to come in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and
begin to quarrel&mdash;and lower myself and my ideas,</q> he reflected.

<head>Chapter II. The Old Buffoon</head>

<p>
They entered the room almost at the same moment that the
elder came in from his bedroom. There were already in the
cell, awaiting the elder, two monks of the hermitage, one the
Father Librarian, and the other Father Païssy, a very learned man, so
they said, in delicate health, though not old. There was also a tall
young man, who looked about two and twenty, standing in the
corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh face, and
clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary
dress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of
the monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,
reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position,
and so not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet
them with a bow.
</p>

<p>
Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha.
The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching
the ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing
them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked
their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously
and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But
Miüsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness.
He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought&mdash;he had reflected
upon it the evening before&mdash;from simple politeness, since it was
the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing,
even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing
and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind.
With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and
moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking
Miüsov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy,
but he too kept his hands at his sides, while Kalganov was so confused
that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall the hand raised
to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down.
The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He was ashamed. His forebodings
were coming true.
</p>

<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>

<p>
Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa,
covered with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along
the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby
black leather. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the
window. The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained
standing. The cell was not very large and had a faded look. It contained
nothing but the most necessary furniture, of coarse and poor
quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window, and a number
of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon of
the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures
in shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china
eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it,
and several foreign engravings from the great Italian artists of past
centuries. Next to these costly and artistic engravings were several
of the roughest Russian prints of saints and martyrs, such as are
sold for a few farthings at all the fairs. On the other walls were
portraits of Russian bishops, past and present.
</p>

<p>
Miüsov took a cursory glance at all these <q>conventional</q> surroundings
and bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high
opinion of his own insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was
fifty, an age at which a clever man of the world of established
position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously. At the first
moment he did not like Zossima. There was, indeed, something in
the elder's face which many people besides Miüsov might not have
liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very weak legs, and
though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years older.
His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,
particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,
quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling
of gray hair about his temples. His pointed beard was small
and scanty, and his lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as
two threads. His nose was not long, but sharp, like a bird's beak.
</p>

<p>
<q>To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,</q> thought
Miüsov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.
</p>

<p>
A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and
served to begin the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely to our time,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>but no sign
of my son, Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!</q> (Alyosha
<pb n='038'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>
shuddered all over at <q>sacred elder.</q>) <q>I am always punctual myself,
minute for minute, remembering that punctuality is the courtesy
of kings....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are not a king, anyway,</q> Miüsov muttered, losing his
self-restraint at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I
always say the wrong thing. Your reverence,</q> he cried, with sudden
pathos, <q>you behold before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce
myself as such. It's an old habit, alas! And if I sometimes
talk nonsense out of place it's with an object, with the object of
amusing people and making myself agreeable. One must be agreeable,
mustn't one? I was seven years ago in a little town where I
had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We
went to the captain of police because we had to see him about
something, and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair,
sulky man, the most dangerous type in such cases. It's their liver.
I went straight up to him, and with the ease of a man of the world,
you know, <q>Mr. Ispravnik,</q> said I, <q>be our Napravnik.</q> <q>What do
you mean by Napravnik?</q> said he. I saw, at the first half-second,
that it had missed fire. He stood there so glum. <q>I wanted to make
a joke,</q> said I, <q>for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our
well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the
harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.</q> And I
explained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? <q>Excuse me,</q>
said he, <q>I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on
my calling.</q> He turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting,
<q>Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.</q> <q>No,</q> he
said, <q>since you called me a Napravnik I am one.</q> And would you
believe it, it ruined our business! And I'm always like that, always
like that. Always injuring myself with my politeness. Once, many
years ago, I said to an influential person: <q>Your wife is a ticklish
lady,</q> in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities, so to speak. But
he asked me, <q>Why, have you tickled her?</q> I thought I'd be polite,
so I couldn't help saying, <q>Yes,</q> and he gave me a fine tickling on
the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I'm not ashamed to tell
the story. I'm always injuring myself like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're doing it now,</q> muttered Miüsov, with disgust.
</p>

<pb n='039'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>

<p>
Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as
soon as I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that
you'd be the first to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn't
coming off, your reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they
were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in
them. That's been so since I was young, when I had to make jokes
for my living in noblemen's families. I am an inveterate buffoon,
and have been from birth up, your reverence, it's as though it were
a craze in me. I dare say it's a devil within me. But only a little
one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But
not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth
having either. But I do believe&mdash;I believe in God, though I have
had doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom.
I'm like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever
hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan
Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine? He went in and
said straight out, <q>There is no God.</q> To which the great bishop
lifted up his finger and answered, <q>The fool hath said in his heart
there is no God.</q> And he fell down at his feet on the spot. <q>I
believe,</q> he cried, <q>and will be christened.</q> And so he was. Princess
Dashkov was his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling
lies and that that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing
the fool?</q> cried Miüsov in a shaking voice.
</p>
