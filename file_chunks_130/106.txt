<p>
<q>I suspected all my life that it wasn't true,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cried with conviction. <q>But I'll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen.
Great elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's
christening I made up just now. I never thought of it before. I
made it up to add piquancy. I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
to make myself agreeable. Though I really don't know myself,
sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot, I heard as far as
<q>the fool hath said in his heart</q> twenty times from the gentry about
here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
tell the story. They all believe to this day that the infidel Diderot
came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan Platon....</q>
</p>

<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>

<p>
Miüsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was
furious, and conscious of being ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty
or fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had
entered that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration.
Almost every one admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was
being shown him. Many remained kneeling during the whole visit.
Of those visitors, many had been men of high rank and learning,
some even freethinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all without exception
had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy, for here
there was no question of money, but only, on the one side love and
kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some
spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered
the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with
unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear
what the elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up,
like Miüsov. Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of
tears. What seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother
Ivan, on whom alone he had rested his hopes, and who alone had such
influence on his father that he could have stopped him, sat now quite
unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to
see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do with it.
Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity student, whom
he knew almost intimately. He alone in the monastery knew Rakitin's
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me,</q> began Miüsov, addressing Father Zossima, <q>for
perhaps I seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made
a mistake in believing that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would
understand what was due on a visit to so honored a personage. I
did not suppose I should have to apologize simply for having come
with him....</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave
the room, overwhelmed with confusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't distress yourself, I beg.</q> The elder got on to his feeble
legs, and taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit
down again. <q>I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg
you to be my guest.</q> And with a bow he went back and sat down
again on his little sofa.
</p>

<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>

<p>
<q>Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?</q> Fyodor
Pavlovitch cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both
hands, as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.
</p>

<p>
<q>I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be
uneasy,</q> the elder said impressively. <q>Do not trouble. Make yourself
quite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself,
for that is at the root of it all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too
much, but I accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed
Father, you'd better not invite me to be my natural self. Don't
risk it.... I will not go so far as that myself. I warn you for
your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged in the mists of uncertainty,
though there are people who'd be pleased to describe me for
you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for you,
holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.</q>
</p>

<p>
He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, <q>Blessed be
the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck&mdash;the
paps especially. When you said just now, <q>Don't be so ashamed of
yourself, for that is at the root of it all,</q> you pierced right through
me by that remark, and read me to the core. Indeed, I always feel
when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take
me for a buffoon. So I say, <q>Let me really play the buffoon. I am
not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one of you worse than
I am.</q> That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame, great elder,
from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes me rowdy.
If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the kindest
and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have
been then! Teacher!</q> he fell suddenly on his knees, <q>what must I
do to gain eternal life?</q>
</p>

<p>
It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really
moved.
</p>

<p>
Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a
smile:
</p>

<p>
<q>You have known for a long time what you must do. You
have sense enough: don't give way to drunkenness and incontinence
of speech; don't give way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the
<pb n='042'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>
love of money. And close your taverns. If you can't close all,
at least two or three. And, above all&mdash;don't lie.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean about Diderot?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The
man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a
pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around
him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having
no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract
himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures,
and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other
men and to himself. The man who lies to himself can be more easily
offended than any one. You know it is sometimes very pleasant
to take offense, isn't it? A man may know that nobody has insulted
him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and
exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made
a mountain out of a molehill&mdash;he knows that himself, yet he will
be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he
feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But
get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the
elder's thin hand. <q>It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said
that so well, as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life
taking offense, to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds,
for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted&mdash;that
you had forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I
shall make a note of that. But I have been lying, lying positively
my whole life long, every day and hour of it. Of a truth, I am a
lie, and the father of lies. Though I believe I am not the father of
lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that
will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk
about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word
will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I
had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose
to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch
not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it true, great
Father, that the story is told somewhere in the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head was cut
off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, <q>courteously kissing
it,</q> walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true or not,
honored Father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it is untrue,</q> said the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What
saint do you say the story is told of?</q> asked the Father Librarian.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I
was deceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you
know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov here, who was
so angry just now about Diderot. He it was who told the story.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present.
It was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous
story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew
nothing of it, but I went home with my faith shaken, and I have
been getting more and more shaken ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
you were the cause of a great fall. That was not a
Diderot!</q>
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly
clear to every one by now that he was playing a part again.
Yet Miüsov was stung by his words.
</p>

<p>
<q>What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,</q> he muttered. <q>I may
really have told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was
told it myself. I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me
it was read at our mass from the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi> ... he was
a very learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics
and had lived a long time in Russia.... I have not read
the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi> myself, and I am not going to read them ...
all sorts of things are said at dinner&mdash;we were dining then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!</q> said Fyodor
Pavlovitch, mimicking him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do I care for your faith?</q> Miüsov was on the point of
shouting, but he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt,
<q>You defile everything you touch.</q>
</p>

<p>
The elder suddenly rose from his seat. <q>Excuse me, gentlemen,
for leaving you a few minutes,</q> he said, addressing all his guests.
<q>I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you. But don't
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
you tell lies all the same,</q> he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch
with a good-humored face. He went out of the cell. Alyosha and
the novice flew to escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless:
he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too, that the elder
was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going
towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But
Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed man!</q> he cried, with feeling. <q>Allow me to kiss your
hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get
on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe
me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you.
I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on
with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am
ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you! But
now, I'll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I'll sit in a chair
and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
You are the principal person left now&mdash;for ten minutes.</q>

<head>Chapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith</head>

<p>
Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of
the precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant
women. They had been told that the elder was at last coming out,
and they had gathered together in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame
Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come out into the portico to
wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women
of rank.
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive,
and always dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had
lively black eyes. She was not more than thirty-three, and had
been five years a widow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially
paralyzed. The poor child had not been able to walk for the
last six months, and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair.
She had a charming little face, rather thin from illness, but full of
gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with
<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>
their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her
abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the
summer by business connected with their estate. They had been staying
a week in our town, where they had come more for purposes of
business than devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once already,
three days before. Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw
any one, they had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently entreated
<q>the happiness of looking once again on the great healer.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter's
invalid carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one
of our monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the
far north. He too sought the elder's blessing.
</p>

<p>
But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight
to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that
led up into the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put
on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him.
One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight
of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains
of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a short
prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted.
</p>

<p>
I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often
happened to see and hear these <q>possessed</q> women in the villages
and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would
squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the
church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led
up to it, at once the <q>possession</q> ceased, and the sick women were
always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at
this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from
my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid
work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various
anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with
astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about
it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially
prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of
the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting
toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth,
and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which
some women were not able to endure like others. The strange and
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she
was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been explained to me
as due to malingering and the trickery of the <q>clericals,</q> arose
probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported
her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond
question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out
if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow
down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged
woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took
place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down
to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing
and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did
come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same
now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.
</p>

<p>
Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy
by the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment,
others cried out in sing-song voices.
</p>

<p>
He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The <q>possessed</q>
woman he knew already. She came from a village only six
versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him before.
</p>

<p>
<q>But here is one from afar.</q> He pointed to a woman by no
means old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt
but almost blackened by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing
with a fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied
in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles
from here. From afar off, Father, from afar off!</q> the woman
began in a sing-song voice as though she were chanting a dirge,
swaying her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her
hand.
</p>

<p>
There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among
the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a
grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and
finds vent in wailing. This is particularly common with women.
But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort
only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire
consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations
spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound.
</p>

<pb n='047'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>

<p>
<q>You are of the tradesman class?</q> said Father Zossima, looking
curiously at her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though
we live in the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard
of you, Father, we heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I
have come on a pilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but
they told me, <q>Go, Nastasya, go to them</q>&mdash;that is to you. I have
come; I was yesterday at the service, and to-day I have come to
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you weeping for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. He was three years
old&mdash;three years all but three months. For my little boy, Father,
I'm in anguish, for my little boy. He was the last one left. We
had four, my Nikita and I, and now we've no children, our dear ones
have all gone. I buried the first three without grieving overmuch,
and now I have buried the last I can't forget him. He seems always
standing before me. He never leaves me. He has withered my
heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and
I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his little things. I look
at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, <q>Let me go on a
pilgrimage, master.</q> He is a driver. We're not poor people,
Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the
horse and the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My
Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He's sure to. It used
to be so before. As soon as I turn my back he gives way to it. But
now I don't think about him. It's three months since I left home.
I've forgotten him. I've forgotten everything. I don't want to
remember. And what would our life be now together? I've done
with him, I've done. I've done with them all. I don't care to look
upon my house and my goods. I don't care to see anything at all!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, mother,</q> said the elder. <q>Once in olden times a holy
saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one,
her only one, whom God had taken. <q>Knowest thou not,</q> said the
saint to her, <q>how bold these little ones are before the throne of
God? Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of
Heaven. <q>Thou didst give us life, O Lord,</q> they say, <q>and scarcely
had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again.</q> And
so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
rank of angels. Therefore,</q> said the saint, <q>thou, too, O mother, rejoice
and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the fellowship
of the angels.</q> That's what the saint said to the weeping
mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken
falsely. Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is
surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying
to God for you, and therefore weep not, but rejoice.</q>
</p>

<p>
The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her
hand. She sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
<q>My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you.
<q>Foolish one,</q> he said, <q>why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with
the angels before God.</q> He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I
see that he cries like me. <q>I know, Nikita,</q> said I. <q>Where could
he be if not with the Lord God? Only, here with us now he is not
as he used to sit beside us before.</q> And if only I could look upon
him one little time, if only I could peep at him one little time, without
going up to him, without speaking, if I could be hidden in a
corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him playing
in the yard, calling in his little voice, <q>Mammy, where are you?</q>
If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room
just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used
to run to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet
I should know him! But he's gone, Father, he's gone, and I shall
never hear him again. Here's his little sash, but him I shall never
see or hear now.</q>
</p>

<p>
She drew out of her bosom her boy's little embroidered sash, and
as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her
eyes with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden
stream.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is Rachel of old,</q> said the elder, <q>weeping for her children,
and will not be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set
on earth for you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not
what you need. Weep and be not consoled, but weep. Only every
time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of
the angels of God, that he looks down from there at you and sees
you, and rejoices at your tears, and points at them to the Lord God;
and a long while yet will you keep that great mother's grief. But
it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be
<pb n='049'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>
only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it
from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your child's soul.
What was his name?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey, Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your
grief in my prayers, and I will pray for your husband's health. It is
a sin for you to leave him. Your little one will see from heaven
that you have forsaken his father, and will weep over you. Why
do you trouble his happiness? He is living, for the soul lives for
ever, and though he is not in the house he is near you, unseen. How
can he go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to
you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together, his father
and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But
then he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother;
go this very day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You've gone
straight to my heart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for
me,</q> the woman began in a sing-song voice; but the elder had
already turned away to a very old woman, dressed like a dweller in
the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes showed that she had come
with an object, and in order to say something. She said she was
the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close by in the
town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had
gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but
now a year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about
him, but she did not know the proper place to inquire.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna&mdash;she's a rich merchant's
wife&mdash;said to me, <q>You go, Prohorovna, and put your son's
name down for prayer in the church, and pray for the peace of his
soul as though he were dead. His soul will be troubled,</q> she said,
<q>and he will write you a letter.</q> And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me
it was a certain thing which had been many times tried. Only I am
in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or false, and would
it be right?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't think of it. It's shameful to ask the question. How
is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own
<pb n='050'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>
mother too! It's a great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance
it is forgiven you. Better pray to the Queen of Heaven,
our swift defense and help, for his good health, and that she may
forgive you for your error. And another thing I will tell you,
Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you, your son, or
he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in peace.
Your son is alive, I tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for
all of us and for our sins!</q>
</p>

<p>
But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes
fixed upon him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young
peasant woman was gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought
him, but she seemed afraid to approach.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, my child?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Absolve my soul, Father,</q> she articulated softly, and slowly
sank on her knees and bowed down at his feet. <q>I have sinned,
Father. I am afraid of my sin.</q>
</p>

<p>
The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer
to him, still on her knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a widow these three years,</q> she began in a half-whisper,
with a sort of shudder. <q>I had a hard life with my husband. He
was an old man. He used to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought
looking at him, if he were to get well, if he were to get up again,
what then? And then the thought came to me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay!</q> said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.
</p>

<p>
The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible
to catch anything. She had soon done.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three years ago?</q> asked the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three years. At first I didn't think about it, but now I've
begun to be ill, and the thought never leaves me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you come from far?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Over three hundred miles away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you told it in confession?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you been admitted to Communion?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your
penitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
can be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to
the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust
the infinite love of God. Can there be a sin which could
exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual repentance,
but dismiss fear altogether. Believe that God loves you
as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your sin, in your sin.
It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more
joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not. Be
not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive
the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled
with him in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love
you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by
love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have
pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a priceless
treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not
only your own sins but the sins of others.</q>
</p>

<p>
He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck
a little ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth
without speaking.
</p>

<p>
He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with
a tiny baby in her arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>From Vyshegorye, dear Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do
you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've come to look at you. I have been to you before&mdash;or have
you forgotten? You've no great memory if you've forgotten me.
They told us you were ill. Thinks I, I'll go and see him for myself.
Now I see you, and you're not ill! You'll live another twenty
years. God bless you! There are plenty to pray for you; how
should you be ill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you for all, daughter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are
sixty copecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me.
I thought as I came along, better give through him. He'll know
whom to give to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you.
I will do so certainly. Is that your little girl?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.</q>
</p>

<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>

<p>
<q>May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta!
You have gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children,
farewell, dear ones.</q>
</p>

<p>
He blessed them all and bowed low to them.

<head>Chapter IV. A Lady Of Little Faith</head>

<p>
A visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the
peasants and his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped
them away with her handkerchief. She was a sentimental society
lady of genuinely good disposition in many respects. When the
elder went up to her at last she met him enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...</q>
She could not go on for emotion. <q>Oh, I understand the
people's love for you. I love the people myself. I want to love
them. And who could help loving them, our splendid Russian
people, so simple in their greatness!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How is your daughter's health? You wanted to talk to me
again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it!
I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your
windows until you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express
our ardent gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her
completely, merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying
your hands upon her. We have hastened here to kiss those hands,
to pour out our feelings and our homage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in
her chair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,</q>
said the lady with nervous haste. <q>And that's not all. Her legs
are stronger. This morning she got up well; she had slept all night.
Look at her rosy cheeks, her bright eyes! She used to be always
crying, but now she laughs and is gay and happy. This morning
she insisted on my letting her stand up, and she stood up for a whole
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
minute without any support. She wagers that in a fortnight she'll
be dancing a quadrille. I've called in Doctor Herzenstube. He
shrugged his shoulders and said, <q>I am amazed; I can make nothing
of it.</q> And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not
fly here to thank you? Lise, thank him&mdash;thank him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise's pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She
rose in her chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder,
clasped her hands before him, but could not restrain herself and
broke into laughter.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's at him,</q> she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation
at herself for not being able to repress her mirth.
</p>

<p>
If any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the
elder, he would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in
an instant. His eyes shone and he looked down.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are
you?</q> the mother went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand
to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at
Alyosha. The latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely
awkward way, held out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important
air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.</q> She handed
him a little note. <q>She particularly begs you to go and see her
as soon as possible; that you will not fail her, but will be sure to
come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?</q> Alyosha
muttered in great astonishment. His face at once looked anxious.
<q>Oh, it's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and&mdash;what has happened
lately,</q> the mother explained hurriedly. <q>Katerina Ivanovna
has made up her mind, but she must see you about it.... Why,
of course, I can't say. But she wants to see you at once. And you
will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have only seen her once,</q> Alyosha protested with the same
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her
suffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is
enduring now! Think what awaits her! It's all terrible, terrible!</q>
</p>

<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>

<p>
<q>Very well, I will come,</q> Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning
the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty
that he would come, without any sort of explanation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!</q> cried Lise
with sudden animation. <q>I told mamma you'd be sure not to go.
I said you were saving your soul. How splendid you are! I've always
thought you were splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise!</q> said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she
had said it.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she said;
<q>you never come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is
never happy except with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again
smiled without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching
him. He had begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before,
had been awaiting his entrance by Lise's chair. He was evidently
a monk of the humblest, that is of the peasant, class, of a
narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in his own way, a stubborn
one. He announced that he had come from the far north, from
Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor monastery,
consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing
and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you presume to do such deeds?</q> the monk asked suddenly,
pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring
to her <q>healing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete
cure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there
has been any healing, it is by no power but God's will. It's all from
God. Visit me, Father,</q> he added to the monk. <q>It's not often I
can see visitors. I am ill, and I know that my days are numbered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a
long, long time yet,</q> cried the lady. <q>And in what way are you ill?
You look so well, so gay and happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it's only
for a moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem
so happy to you, you could never say anything that would please
me so much. For men are made for happiness, and any one who is
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
completely happy has a right to say to himself, <q>I am doing God's
will on earth.</q> All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs
were happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!</q> cried the
lady. <q>You seem to pierce with your words. And yet&mdash;happiness,
happiness&mdash;where is it? Who can say of himself that he is happy?
Oh, since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day,
let me tell you what I could not utter last time, what I dared
not say, all I am suffering and have been for so long! I am suffering!
Forgive me! I am suffering!</q>
</p>

<p>
And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>From what specially?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suffer ... from lack of faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lack of faith in God?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life&mdash;it
is such an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen!
You are a healer, you are deeply versed in the human soul, and of
course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure
you on my word of honor that I am not speaking lightly now. The
thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish, to
terror. And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not dared
to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God!
What will you think of me now?</q>
</p>

<p>
She clasped her hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't distress yourself about my opinion of you,</q> said the elder.
<q>I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and
ask myself if every one has faith, where did it come from? And
then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena
of nature, and that none of it's real. And I say to myself,
<q>What if I've been believing all my life, and when I come to die
there's nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave?</q> as I read
in some author. It's awful! How&mdash;how can I get back my faith?
But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically, without
thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come
now to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this
chance slip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it?
How can I convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares; no one
troubles his head about it, and I'm the only one who can't stand it.
It's deadly&mdash;deadly!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No doubt. But there's no proving it, though you can be convinced
of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor
actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you
will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your
soul. If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your
neighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can
possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In active love? There's another question&mdash;and such a question!
You see, I so love humanity that&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;I often
dream of forsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister
of mercy. I close my eyes and think and dream, and at that
moment I feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles. No
wounds, no festering sores could at that moment frighten me. I
would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would
nurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams
and not others. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in
reality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?</q> the lady went
on fervently, almost frantically. <q>That's the chief question&mdash;that's
my most agonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself,
<q>Would you persevere long on that path? And if the patient whose
wounds you are washing did not meet you with gratitude, but worried
you with his whims, without valuing or remarking your
charitable services, began abusing you and rudely commanding you,
and complaining to the superior authorities of you (which often
happens when people are in great suffering)&mdash;what then? Would
you persevere in your love, or not?</q> And do you know, I came with
horror to the conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love
to humanity, it would be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant,
I expect my payment at once&mdash;that is, praise, and the repayment
of love with love. Otherwise I am incapable of loving any
one.</q>
</p>

<pb n='057'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>

<p>
She was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding,
she looked with defiant resolution at the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's just the same story as a doctor once told me,</q> observed
the elder. <q>He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly
clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest.
<q>I love humanity,</q> he said, <q>but I wonder at myself. The more I love
humanity in general, the less I love man in particular. In my
dreams,</q> he said, <q>I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes
for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have faced
crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary; and yet I am incapable
of living in the same room with any one for two days
together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me,
his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom.
In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one
because he's too long over his dinner; another because he has a cold
and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment
they come close to me. But it has always happened that the
more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love
for humanity.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must
one despair?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you
can, and it will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you
since you can so deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have
been talking to me so sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your
frankness, as you did from me just now, then of course you will not
attain to anything in the achievement of real love; it will all get
no further than dreams, and your whole life will slip away like a
phantom. In that case you will naturally cease to think of the
future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer after a fashion
in the end.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand
that I was really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity
when I told you I could not endure ingratitude. You have revealed
me to myself. You have seen through me and explained me to
myself!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession,
I believe that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
attain happiness, always remember that you are on the right road,
and try not to leave it. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of
falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own
deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid
being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you
bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing
it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence
of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don't be frightened overmuch
even at your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling
to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared
with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate
action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men will even
give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon
over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage.
But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too,
perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you see
with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther
from your goal instead of nearer to it&mdash;at that very moment I predict
that you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power
of the Lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously
guiding you. Forgive me for not being able to stay longer with you.
They are waiting for me. Good-by.</q>
</p>

<p>
The lady was weeping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, Lise! Bless her&mdash;bless her!</q> she cried, starting up suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness
all along,</q> the elder said jestingly. <q>Why have you been laughing
at Alexey?</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time.
She had noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at
her, and she found this extremely amusing. She waited intently to
catch his eye. Alyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was
irresistibly and suddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she
smiled triumphantly in his face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted
and vexed. At last he turned away from her altogether and
hid behind the elder's back. After a few minutes, drawn by the
same irresistible force, he turned again to see whether he was being
looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out of her chair
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look. Catching
his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying, <q>Why
do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed
and her face became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and
nervously in a warm and resentful voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me
about when I was little. We used to play together. He used to
come to teach me to read, do you know. Two years ago, when he
went away, he said that he would never forget me, that we were
friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now he's afraid of me all at
once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesn't he want to come near
me? Why doesn't he talk? Why won't he come and see us? It's not
that you won't let him. We know that he goes everywhere. It's
not good manners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought
of it first, if he hasn't forgotten me. No, now he's saving his soul!
Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs he'll fall.</q>
</p>

<p>
And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into
irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened
to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed
his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be angry with me. I'm silly and good for nothing ...
and perhaps Alyosha's right, quite right, in not wanting to come and
see such a ridiculous girl.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will certainly send him,</q> said the elder.

<head>Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It!</head>

<p>
The elder's absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-five
minutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on
whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. But
he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the
cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation. Ivan
and the two monks took the leading share in it. Miüsov, too, was
trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the conversation.
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was evidently in the
background, and his remarks were treated with neglect, which increased
his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with
Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan
showed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is
progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores
us,</q> he thought.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be
quiet, had actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his
neighbor Miüsov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying
his discomfiture. He had been waiting for some time to pay off
old scores, and now he could not let the opportunity slip. Bending
over his shoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didn't you go away just now, after the <q>courteously kissing</q>?
Why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company?
It was because you felt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained
to vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence. Now you
won't go till you've displayed your intellect to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You again?... On the contrary, I'm just going.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be the last, the last of all to go!</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered
him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father
Zossima's return.
</p>

<p>
The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating
himself in his former place, looked at them all as though cordially
inviting them to go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his
face, saw that he was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort.
Of late he had been liable to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face
had the pallor that was common before such attacks, and his lips
were white. But he evidently did not want to break up the party.
He seemed to have some special object of his own in keeping them.
What object? Alyosha watched him intently.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,</q> said
Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan.
<q>He brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument
cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an
ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court,
and the scope of its jurisdiction.</q>
</p>

<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry I have not read your article, but I've heard of it,</q>
said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>He takes up a most interesting position,</q> continued the Father
Librarian. <q>As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently
quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's interesting. But in what sense?</q> Father Zossima asked
Ivan.
</p>

<p>
The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha
had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill
and apparently without the slightest
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>arrière-pensée</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
<q>I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is,
of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on
for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle,
and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent
or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation
of it. Compromise between the Church and State in such
questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible
in any real sense. My clerical opponent maintains that the
Church holds a precise and defined position in the State. I maintain,
on the contrary, that the Church ought to include the whole
State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and, if this is, for
some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in reality, to be
set up as the direct and chief aim of the future development of
Christian society!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perfectly true,</q> Father Païssy, the silent and learned monk,
assented with fervor and decision.
</p>

<p>
<q>The purest Ultramontanism!</q> cried Miüsov impatiently, crossing
and recrossing his legs.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, well, we have no mountains,</q> cried Father Iosif, and turning
to the elder he continued: <q>Observe the answer he makes to the
following <q>fundamental and essential</q> propositions of his opponent,
who is, you must note, an ecclesiastic. First, that <q>no social organization
can or ought to arrogate to itself power to dispose of the
civic and political rights of its members.</q> Secondly, that <q>criminal
and civil jurisdiction ought not to belong to the Church, and is
inconsistent with its nature, both as a divine institution and as an
organization of men for religious objects,</q> and, finally, in the third
place, <q>the Church is a kingdom not of this world.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>

<p>
<q>A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!</q> Father
Païssy could not refrain from breaking in again. <q>I have read the
book which you have answered,</q> he added, addressing Ivan, <q>and
was astounded at the words <q>the Church is a kingdom not of this
world.</q> If it is not of this world, then it cannot exist on earth at
all. In the Gospel, the words <q>not of this world</q> are not used in that
sense. To play with such words is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus
Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. The Kingdom of
Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is
only entered through the Church which has been founded and
established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in
such a connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in
truth, a kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly
become the kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that
we have the divine promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After
listening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the
elder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:
</p>

<p>
<q>The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the
first three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church
and was nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire
desired to become Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming
Christian, it included the Church but remained a pagan State
in very many of its departments. In reality this was bound to
happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of the pagan
civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects and
fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering
into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental
principles&mdash;the rock on which it stands&mdash;and could pursue
no other aims than those which have been ordained and revealed
by God Himself, and among them that of drawing the whole world,
and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the Church. In
that way (that is, with a view to the future) it is not the Church
that should seek a definite position in the State, like <q>every social
organization,</q> or as <q>an organization of men for religious purposes</q>
(as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the contrary, every
earthly State should be, in the end, completely transformed into the
Church and should become nothing else but a Church, rejecting
<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>
every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this
will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory
as a great State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it
from a false, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful
path, which alone leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author
of the book <hi rend='italic'>On the Foundations of Church Jurisdiction</hi> would have
judged correctly if, in seeking and laying down those foundations,
he had looked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in
our sinful and imperfect days. But as soon as the author ventures
to declare that the foundations which he predicates now, part of
which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the permanent, essential,
and eternal foundations, he is going directly against the Church
and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist of my article.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is, in brief,</q> Father Païssy began again, laying stress on each
word, <q>according to certain theories only too clearly formulated
in the nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into
the State, as though this would be an advance from a lower to a
higher form, so as to disappear into it, making way for science, for
the spirit of the age, and civilization. And if the Church resists
and is unwilling, some corner will be set apart for her in the State,
and even that under control&mdash;and this will be so everywhere in all
modern European countries. But Russian hopes and conceptions
demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower into a
higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State should
end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else.
So be it! So be it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I confess you've reassured me somewhat,</q> Miüsov said
smiling, again crossing his legs. <q>So far as I understand, then, the
realization of such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming
of Christ. That's as you please. It's a beautiful Utopian dream
of the abolition of war, diplomacy, banks, and so on&mdash;something
after the fashion of socialism, indeed. But I imagined that it was
all meant seriously, and that the Church might be <emph>now</emph> going to try
criminals, and sentence them to beating, prison, and even death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church
would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death.
Crime and the way of regarding it would inevitably change, not all
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
at once of course, but fairly soon,</q> Ivan replied calmly, without
flinching.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you serious?</q> Miüsov glanced keenly at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all
the criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,</q>
Ivan went on. <q>I ask you, what would become of the excluded?
He would be cut off then not only from men, as now, but from
Christ. By his crime he would have transgressed not only against
men but against the Church of Christ. This is so even now, of
course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly enunciated, and very,
very often the criminal of to-day compromises with his conscience:
<q>I steal,</q> he says, <q>but I don't go against the Church. I'm not an
enemy of Christ.</q> That's what the criminal of to-day is continually
saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the State
it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over the
world, to say: <q>All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are
the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian
Church.</q> It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it
requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on
the other side, take the Church's own view of crime: is it not bound
to renounce the present almost pagan attitude, and to change from
a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation
of society, as at present, into completely and honestly adopting the
idea of the regeneration of the man, of his reformation and salvation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? I fail to understand again,</q> Miüsov interrupted.
<q>Some sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even
incomprehensible. What is excommunication? What sort of exclusion?
I suspect you are simply amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,</q> said the elder suddenly,
and all turned to him at once. <q>If it were not for the
Church of Christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal
from evil-doing, no real chastisement for it afterwards; none, that
is, but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now, which in the
majority of cases only embitters the heart; and not the real punishment,
the only effectual one, the only deterrent and softening one,
which lies in the recognition of sin by conscience.</q>
</p>

<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>

<p>
<q>How is that, may one inquire?</q> asked Miüsov, with lively
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why,</q> began the elder, <q>all these sentences to exile with hard
labor, and formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what's
more, deter hardly a single criminal, and the number of crimes
does not diminish but is continually on the increase. You must
admit that. Consequently the security of society is not preserved,
for, although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and
sent far away out of sight, another criminal always comes to take
his place at once, and often two of them. If anything does preserve
society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform
the criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience.
It is only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christian
society&mdash;that is, of the Church&mdash;that he recognizes his sin against
society&mdash;that is, against the Church. So that it is only against
the Church, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day
can recognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,
then it would know when to bring back from exclusion
and to reunite to itself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction,
but only the power of moral condemnation, withdraws of her
own accord from punishing the criminal actively. She does not
excommunicate him but simply persists in motherly exhortation of
him. What is more, the Church even tries to preserve all Christian
communion with the criminal. She admits him to church services,
to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats him more as a
captive than as a convict. And what would become of the criminal,
O Lord, if even the Christian society&mdash;that is, the Church&mdash;were to
reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off?
What would become of him if the Church punished him with her
excommunication as the direct consequence of the secular law?
There could be no more terrible despair, at least for a Russian
criminal, for Russian criminals still have faith. Though, who
knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen, perhaps the
despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what
would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving
mother, holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner
is too severely punished already by the civil law, and there must
be at least some one to have pity on him. The Church holds aloof,
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
above all, because its judgment is the only one that contains the
truth, and therefore cannot practically and morally be united to any
other judgment even as a temporary compromise. She can enter
into no compact about that. The foreign criminal, they say, rarely
repents, for the very doctrines of to-day confirm him in the idea
that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly
oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a force that
triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of themselves
in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness,
and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate
of the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without the
compassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there
are no churches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid
church buildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago
striven to pass from Church into State and to disappear in it completely.
So it seems at least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome,
it was proclaimed a State instead of a Church a thousand years ago.
And so the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member of
the Church and sinks into despair. If he returns to society, often
it is with such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him off.
You can judge for yourself how it must end. In many cases it
would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is that besides
the established law courts we have the Church too, which always
keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son.
And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought, the
judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice
is still living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively
recognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said
here just now is true too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the
Church were introduced in practice in its full force, that is, if the
whole of the society were changed into the Church, not only the
judgment of the Church would have influence on the reformation
of the criminal such as it never has now, but possibly also the crimes
themselves would be incredibly diminished. And there can be no
doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the crime
of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed
in restoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in
regenerating the fallen. It is true,</q> said Father Zossima, with a
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
smile, <q>the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting
on some seven righteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will
continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation
from a society almost heathen in character into a single universal
and all-powerful Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at
the end of the ages, for it is ordained to come to pass! And there
is no need to be troubled about times and seasons, for the secret
of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of God, in His foresight,
and His love. And what in human reckoning seems still afar off,
may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve of its
appearance. And so be it, so be it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So be it, so be it!</q> Father Païssy repeated austerely and reverently.
</p>

<p>
<q>Strange, extremely strange!</q> Miüsov pronounced, not so much
with heat as with latent indignation.
</p>

<p>
<q>What strikes you as so strange?</q> Father Iosif inquired cautiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's beyond anything!</q> cried Miüsov, suddenly breaking
out; <q>the State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position
of the State. It's not simply Ultramontanism, it's arch-Ultramontanism!
It's beyond the dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are completely misunderstanding it,</q> said Father Païssy
sternly. <q>Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the
State. That is Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation
of the devil. On the contrary, the State is transformed into the
Church, will ascend and become a Church over the whole world&mdash;which
is the complete opposite of Ultramontanism and Rome, and
your interpretation, and is only the glorious destiny ordained for the
Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the east!</q>
</p>

<p>
Miüsov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinary
personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending
smile played on his lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing
heart. The whole conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced
casually at Rakitin, who was standing immovable in his place by
the door listening and watching intently though with downcast
eyes. But from the color in his cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin
was probably no less excited, and he knew what caused his excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,</q> Miüsov
said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. <q>Some years ago,
<pb n='068'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>
soon after the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>coup d'état</foreign>
of December, I happened to be calling
in Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government,
and I met a very interesting man in his house. This individual
was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a
whole regiment of political detectives&mdash;a rather powerful position
in its own way. I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity
of conversation with him. And as he had not come as a
visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report, and as
he saw the reception given me by his chief, he deigned to speak
with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course. He was
rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,
especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The
subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted.
I will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this
person. <q>We are not particularly afraid,</q> said he, <q>of all these socialists,
anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them
and know all their goings on. But there are a few peculiar men
among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at the same
time are socialists. These are the people we are most afraid of.
They are dreadful people! The socialist who is a Christian is more
to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.</q> The words struck
me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to me here,
gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?</q> Father
Païssy asked directly, without beating about the bush.
</p>

<p>
But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer,
the door opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
came in. They had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his
sudden appearance caused some surprise for a moment.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?</head>

<p>
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty,
of medium height and agreeable countenance, looked older
than his years. He was muscular, and showed signs of considerable
<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>
physical strength. Yet there was something not healthy in his face.
It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy
sallowness in their color. His rather large, prominent, dark
eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet there was a
vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking
irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed
something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing.
<q>It's hard to tell what he's thinking,</q> those who talked to him
sometimes declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen
in his eyes were startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness
to mirthful and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his
eyes were so gloomy. A certain strained look in his face was easy
to understand at this moment. Every one knew, or had heard of,
the extremely restless and dissipated life which he had been leading
of late, as well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused
in his quarrels with his father. There were several stories current
in the town about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature, <q>of
an unstable and unbalanced mind,</q> as our justice of the peace,
Katchalnikov, happily described him.
</p>

<p>
He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned
frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat.
Having only lately left the army, he still had mustaches and no
beard. His dark brown hair was cropped short, and combed forward
on his temples. He had the long, determined stride of a
military man. He stood still for a moment on the threshold, and
glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder, guessing
him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked his blessing.
Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed
his hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so
long, but Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to
my inquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one.
Now I suddenly learn&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't disturb yourself,</q> interposed the elder. <q>No matter. You
are a little late. It's of no consequence....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your
goodness.</q>
</p>

<pb n='070'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>

<p>
Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly
towards his father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful
bow. He had evidently considered it beforehand, and made this
bow in all seriousness, thinking it his duty to show his respect and
good intentions.
</p>

<p>
Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal
to the occasion. In response to Dmitri's bow he jumped up from his
chair and made his son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly
solemn and impressive, which gave him a positively malignant
look. Dmitri bowed generally to all present, and without a word
walked to the window with his long, resolute stride, sat down on the
only empty chair, near Father Païssy, and, bending forward, prepared
to listen to the conversation he had interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri's entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the
conversation was resumed. But this time Miüsov thought it unnecessary
to reply to Father Païssy's persistent and almost irritable
question.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,</q> he observed with
a certain well-bred nonchalance. <q>It's a subtle question, too. Here
Ivan Fyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting
to say about that also. Ask him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing special, except one little remark,</q> Ivan replied at once.
<q>European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often
mix up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity.
This wild notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it's not
only Liberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity,
but, in many cases, it appears, the police&mdash;the foreign police, of
course&mdash;do the same. Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,</q> Miüsov
repeated. <q>I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting
and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself.
Only five days ago, in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he
solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole
world to make men love their neighbors. That there was no law
of nature that man should love mankind, and that, if there had
been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing to a natural law,
but simply because men have believed in immortality. Ivan Fyodorovitch
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that
faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality,
not only love but every living force maintaining the
life of the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing
then would be immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism.
That's not all. He ended by asserting that for every individual,
like ourselves, who does not believe in God or immortality,
the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact
contrary of the former religious law, and that egoism, even to crime,
must become not only lawful but even recognized as the inevitable,
the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position. From
this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric
and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch's theories.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me,</q> Dmitri cried suddenly; <q>if I've heard aright, crime
must not only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable
and the most rational outcome of his position for every infidel!
Is that so or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so,</q> said Father Païssy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll remember it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly
as he had begun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the
disappearance of the faith in immortality?</q> the elder asked Ivan
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is
no immortality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why unhappy?</q> Ivan asked smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because, in all probability you don't believe yourself in the immortality
of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in
your article on Church jurisdiction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn't altogether joking,</q>
Ivan suddenly and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You were not altogether joking. That's true. The question
is still fretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes
sometimes to divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it
by despair itself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself
with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
don't believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock
at them inwardly.... That question you have not answered, and
it is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?</q>
Ivan went on asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the
same inexplicable smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>If it can't be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided
in the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your
heart, and all its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who
has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking
and seeking higher things, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God
grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth, and may God
bless your path.</q>
</p>

<p>
The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the
cross over Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his
seat, went up to him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand
went back to his place in silence. His face looked firm and earnest.
This action and all the preceding conversation, which was so surprising
from Ivan, impressed every one by its strangeness and a certain
solemnity, so that all were silent for a moment, and there was a
look almost of apprehension in Alyosha's face. But Miüsov suddenly
shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment Fyodor
Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most pious and holy elder,</q> he cried, pointing to Ivan, <q>that is
my son, flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most
dutiful Karl Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in,
Dmitri, against whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful
Franz Moor&mdash;they are both out of Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Robbers</hi>, and so
I am the reigning Count von Moor! Judge and save us! We need not
only your prayers but your prophecies!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak without buffoonery, and don't begin by insulting the
members of your family,</q> answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted
voice. He was obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his
strength was failing.
</p>

<p>
<q>An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!</q> cried
Dmitri indignantly. He too leapt up. <q>Forgive it, reverend
Father,</q> he added, addressing the elder. <q>I am not a cultivated
man, and I don't even know how to address you properly, but you
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
have been deceived and you have been too good-natured in letting
us meet here. All my father wants is a scandal. Why he wants it
only he can tell. He always has some motive. But I believe I
know why&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They all blame me, all of them!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his
turn. <q>Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been
blaming me, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you have!</q> he turned suddenly
to Miüsov, although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting
him. <q>They all accuse me of having hidden the children's money
in my boots, and cheated them, but isn't there a court of law?
There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, from
your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money
you had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left.
Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri
is not a stranger to him. Because they are all against me, while
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to me, and not a little, but some
thousands of which I have documentary proof. The whole town is
echoing with his debaucheries. And where he was stationed before,
he several times spent a thousand or two for the seduction of some
respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in its
most secret details. I'll prove it.... Would you believe it, holy
Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorable of young
ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,
formerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and
had the Anna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by
his promise of marriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed
to him, yet before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on
a certain enchantress. And although this enchantress has lived in,
so to speak, civil marriage with a respectable man, yet she is of an
independent character, an unapproachable fortress for everybody,
just like a legal wife&mdash;for she is virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is
virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to open this fortress with a
golden key, and that's why he is insolent to me now, trying to get
money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress
already. He's continually borrowing money for the purpose. From
whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be silent!</q> cried Dmitri, <q>wait till I'm gone. Don't dare in my
presence to asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you
<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
should utter a word about her is an outrage, and I won't permit it!</q>
</p>

<p>
He was breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya! Mitya!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing
out a tear. <q>And is your father's blessing nothing to you? If
I curse you, what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shameless hypocrite!</q> exclaimed Dmitri furiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with
others? Gentlemen, only fancy; there's a poor but honorable man
living here, burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got
into trouble and was discharged from the army, but not publicly,
not by court-martial, with no slur on his honor. And three weeks
ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in a tavern, dragged him out
into the street and beat him publicly, and all because he is an agent
in a little business of mine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all a lie! Outwardly it's the truth, but inwardly a lie!</q>
Dmitri was trembling with rage. <q>Father, I don't justify my action.
Yes, I confess it publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and
I regret it now, and I'm disgusted with myself for my brutal rage.
But this captain, this agent of yours, went to that lady whom you
call an enchantress, and suggested to her from you, that she should
take I.O.U.'s of mine which were in your possession, and should sue
me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of them, if
I persisted in claiming an account from you of my property. Now
you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you
yourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face....
She told me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to
put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her, because
you'd begun to force your attentions upon her; and I know all
about that, too; she laughed at you for that as well&mdash;you hear&mdash;she
laughed at you as she described it. So here you have this man, this
father who reproaches his profligate son! Gentlemen, forgive my
anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you
together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if he held
out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has just
this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady,
for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in
vain, I have made up my mind to show up his game, though he is
my father....</q>
</p>

<p>
He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed
with difficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except
Father Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked
austere but waited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale,
not from excitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring
smile lighted up his face; from time to time he raised his
hand, as though to check the storm, and, of course, a gesture from
him would have been enough to end the scene; but he seemed to be
waiting for something and watched them intently as though trying
to make out something which was not perfectly clear to him. At
last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,</q> he said hotly.
<q>But I did not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom
I had to deal. This must be stopped at once! Believe me, your
reverence, I had no precise knowledge of the details that have just
come to light, I was unwilling to believe them, and I learn for the
first time.... A father is jealous of his son's relations with a
woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the creature to get his
son into prison! This is the company in which I have been forced
to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was as
much deceived as any one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in
an unnatural voice, <q>if you were not my son I would challenge you
this instant to a duel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a
handkerchief,</q> he ended, stamping with both feet.
</p>

<p>
With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments
when they enter so completely into their part that they
tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest, although at that very
moment, or a second later, they are able to whisper to themselves,
<q>You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner! You're acting
now, in spite of your <q>holy</q> wrath.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt
at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought ... I thought,</q> he said, in a soft and, as it were,
controlled voice, <q>that I was coming to my native place with the
angel of my heart, my betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find
nothing but a depraved profligate, a despicable clown!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A duel!</q> yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering
<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>
at each syllable. <q>And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, let me
tell you that there has never been in all your family a loftier, and
more honest&mdash;you hear&mdash;more honest woman than this <q>creature,</q>
as you have dared to call her! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have
abandoned your betrothed for that <q>creature,</q> so you must yourself
have thought that your betrothed couldn't hold a candle to her.
That's the woman called a <q>creature</q>!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shameful!</q> broke from Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shameful and disgraceful!</q> Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in
a boyish voice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till
