
<p>
<q>Do you suppose he'd think much of that, with his temper,
which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says
if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I'll
be the first to suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I
were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police
know. God only knows what he might not do!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His honor said to him the other day, <q>I'll pound you in a mortar!</q></q>
added Marya Kondratyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,</q> observed
Alyosha. <q>If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that
too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,</q> said Smerdyakov, as
though thinking better of it; <q>I am here as an old friend and neighbor,
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>
and it would be odd if I didn't come. On the other hand, Ivan
Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother's
lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to
Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here, in
the market-place. I went, but didn't find Dmitri Fyodorovitch
at home, though it was eight o'clock. <q>He's been here, but he is
quite gone,</q> those were the very words of his landlady. It's as
though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this
moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan
Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch
dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you
most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you,
for he'd kill me for nothing at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?</q> repeated
Alyosha quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Metropolis tavern in the market-place?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The very same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's quite likely,</q> cried Alyosha, much excited. <q>Thank you,
Smerdyakov; that's important. I'll go there at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't betray me,</q> Smerdyakov called after him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, I'll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don't
be anxious.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But wait a minute, I'll open the gate to you,</q> cried Marya
Kondratyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>No; it's a short cut, I'll get over the fence again.</q>
</p>

<p>
What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran
to the tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in
his monastic dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his
brothers and call them down. But just as he reached the tavern, a
window was flung open, and his brother Ivan called down to him
from it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, can't you come up here to me? I shall be awfully
grateful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I can, only I don't quite know whether in this
dress&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I'll run down
to meet you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/>

<p>
A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was
alone dining.

<p>
Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place
shut off by a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in
the room. It was the first room from the entrance with a buffet
along the wall. Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it.
The only customer in the room was an old retired military man
drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual bustle going on
in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for the waiters,
the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the drone of
the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this tavern
and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he
reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was
not there.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don't live on tea
alone, I suppose,</q> cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got
hold of Alyosha. He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,</q> said Alyosha
gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you
used to love cherry jam when you were little?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were
eleven, I was nearly fifteen. There's such a difference between
fifteen and eleven that brothers are never companions at those ages.
I don't know whether I was fond of you even. When I went away
to Moscow for the first few years I never thought of you at all.
Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we only met once somewhere,
I believe. And now I've been here more than three months,
and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I
am going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could
see you to say good-by and just then you passed.</q>
</p>

<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>

<p>
<q>Were you very anxious to see me, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you
to know me. And then to say good-by. I believe it's always best
to get to know people just before leaving them. I've noticed
how you've been looking at me these three months. There has been
a continual look of expectation in your eyes, and I can't endure that.
That's how it is I've kept away from you. But in the end I have
learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I thought.
Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don't you?
I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by,
even if they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes
ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant
eyes. You seem to love me for some reason, Alyosha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you&mdash;Ivan is a tomb! I
say of you, Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But
I understand something in you, and I did not understand it till this
morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that?</q> laughed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't be angry?</q> Alyosha laughed too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That you are just as young as other young men of three and
twenty, that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in
fact! Now, have I insulted you dreadfully?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,</q> cried Ivan,
warmly and good-humoredly. <q>Would you believe it that ever since
that scene with her, I have thought of nothing else but my youthful
greenness, and just as though you guessed that, you begin about
it. Do you know I've been sitting here thinking to myself: that if
I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith
in the order of things, were convinced in fact that everything is a
disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, if I were
struck by every horror of man's disillusionment&mdash;still I should
want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn
away from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure
to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away&mdash;where
I don't know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph
over everything&mdash;every disillusionment, every disgust with
life. I've asked myself many times whether there is in the world
<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>
any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly
thirst for life in me, and I've come to the conclusion that there
isn't, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of myself, I
fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists&mdash;and poets especially&mdash;often
call that thirst for life base. It's a feature of the Karamazovs,
it's true, that thirst for life regardless of everything; you have
it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal force on our
planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life,
and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in
the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they
open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one
loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great
deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in
them, yet from old habit one's heart prizes them. Here they have
brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It's first-rate
soup, they know how to make it here. I want to travel in Europe,
Alyosha, I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only
going to a graveyard, but it's a most precious graveyard, that's
what it is! Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over
them speaks of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith
in their work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I
know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep
over them; though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been
nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but
simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul
in my emotion. I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky&mdash;that's
all it is. It's not a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving
with one's inside, with one's stomach. One loves the first strength
of one's youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?</q>
Ivan laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one's inside,
with one's stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully
glad that you have such a longing for life,</q> cried Alyosha. <q>I
think every one should love life above everything in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Love life more than the meaning of it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be
regardless of logic, and it's only then one will understand the meaning
of it. I have thought so a long time. Half your work is done,
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
Ivan, you love life, now you've only to try to do the second half
and you are saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what
does your second half mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died
after all. Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>professions de foi</foreign>
from such&mdash;novices. You are a steadfast person,
Alexey. Is it true that you mean to leave the monastery?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before
I am thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father
doesn't want to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams
of hanging on to eighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too
seriously, though he is a buffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he
stands on his sensuality&mdash;though after we are thirty, indeed, there
may be nothing else to stand on.... But to hang on to seventy is
nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain <q>a shadow of nobility</q>
by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, but I saw Smerdyakov,</q> and Alyosha rapidly, though
minutely, described his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began
listening anxiously and questioned him.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about
him,</q> added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you frowning on Smerdyakov's account?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see
Dmitri, but now there's no need,</q> said Ivan reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But are you really going so soon, brother?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?</q> asked Alyosha
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it?
Am I my brother Dmitri's keeper?</q> Ivan snapped irritably, but
then he suddenly smiled bitterly. <q>Cain's answer about his murdered
brother, wasn't it? Perhaps that's what you're thinking at this
moment? Well, damn it all, I can't stay here to be their keeper,
can I? I've finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you
imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I've been trying to steal his
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense,
I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished
it just now, you were witness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At Katerina Ivanovna's?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and I've released myself once for all. And after all, what
have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn't come in. I had my own
business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary,
that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding
between us. I didn't ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her
over to me and gave us his blessing. It's all too funny. Ah, Alyosha,
if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe,
it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne
to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It's been going
on nearly six months, and all at once I've thrown it off. I could
never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an
end to it if I wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are speaking of your love, Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I
worried myself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over
her ... and all at once it's collapsed! I spoke this morning with
inspiration, but I went away and roared with laughter. Would you
believe it? Yes, it's the literal truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem very merry about it now,</q> observed Alyosha, looking
into his face, which had suddenly grown brighter.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how could I tell that I didn't care for her a bit! Ha ha! It
appears after all I didn't. And yet how she attracted me! How
attractive she was just now when I made my speech! And do you
know she attracts me awfully even now, yet how easy it is to leave
her. Do you think I am boasting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, only perhaps it wasn't love.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>don't make reflections about love, it's
unseemly for you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning!
I've forgotten to kiss you for it.... But how she tormented
me! It certainly was sitting by a <q>laceration.</q> Ah, she knew how
I loved her! She loved me and not Dmitri,</q> Ivan insisted gayly.
<q>Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a self-laceration. All I told her
just now was perfectly true, but the worst of it is, it may take her
fifteen or twenty years to find out that she doesn't care for Dmitri,
<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>
and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she may never find
it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, it's better so; I can
simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What
happened after I departed?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now,
he heard, unconscious and delirious.
</p>

<p>
<q>Isn't Madame Hohlakov laying it on?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don't
matter. God gave woman hysterics as a relief. I won't go to her
at all. Why push myself forward again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you told her that she had never cared for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne?
Let us drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, brother, we had better not drink,</q> said Alyosha suddenly.
<q>Besides I feel somehow depressed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you've been depressed a long time, I've noticed it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Morning? I didn't say I should go in the morning.... But
perhaps it may be the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here
to-day only to avoid dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I
should have left long ago, so far as he is concerned. But why are
you so worried about my going away? We've plenty of time before
I go, an eternity!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an
eternity?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what does it matter to us?</q> laughed Ivan. <q>We've time
enough for our talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look
so surprised? Answer: why have we met here? To talk of my
love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man and Dmitri? of foreign
travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of the Emperor Napoleon?
Is that it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you know what for. It's different for other people; but
we in our green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of
all. That's what we care about. Young Russia is talking about
nothing but the eternal questions now. Just when the old folks are
all taken up with practical questions. Why have you been looking
<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>
at me in expectation for the last three months? To ask me, <q>What
do you believe, or don't you believe at all?</q> That's what your eyes
have been meaning for these three months, haven't they?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps so,</q> smiled Alyosha. <q>You are not laughing at me,
now, Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Me laughing! I don't want to wound my little brother who has
been watching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha,
look straight at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you
are, only not a novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up
till now, some of them, I mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance,
here, they meet and sit down in a corner. They've never
met in their lives before and, when they go out of the tavern, they
won't meet again for forty years. And what do they talk about in
that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions, of
the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe
in God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation
of all humanity on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same,
they're the same questions turned inside out. And masses, masses
of the most original Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal
questions! Isn't it so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, for real Russians the questions of God's existence and of
immortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out,
come first and foremost, of course, and so they should,</q> said Alyosha,
still watching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Alyosha, it's sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all,
but anything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time
one can hardly imagine. But there's one Russian boy called Alyosha
I am awfully fond of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How nicely you put that in!</q> Alyosha laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of
God, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father's that
there was no God.</q> Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and
I saw your eyes glow. But now I've no objection to discussing with
you, and I say so very seriously. I want to be friends with you,
Alyosha, for I have no friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy,
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
perhaps I too accept God,</q> laughed Ivan; <q>that's a surprise for you,
isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Joking? I was told at the elder's yesterday that I was joking.
You know, dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century
who declared that, if there were no God, he would have to be
invented. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>S'il n'existait
pas Dieu, il faudrait l'inventer.</foreign> And man
has actually invented God. And what's strange, what would be
marvelous, is not that God should really exist; the marvel is that
such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God, could enter the head
of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy it is, so touching,
so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me, I've long
resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And
I won't go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that
subject, all derived from European hypotheses; for what's a hypothesis
there, is an axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with
the boys but with their teachers too, for our Russian professors are
often just the same boys themselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses.
For what are we aiming at now? I am trying to explain as
quickly as possible my essential nature, that is what manner of
man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope, that's it, isn't it?
And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply. But you must
note this: if God exists and if He really did create the world, then,
as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of Euclid
and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions
in space. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers,
and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt
whether the whole universe, or to speak more widely the whole of
being, was only created in Euclid's geometry; they even dare to
dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never
meet on earth, may meet somewhere in infinity. I have come to the
conclusion that, since I can't understand even that, I can't expect
to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly that I have no
faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian earthly mind,
and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And
I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially
about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only
three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what's
more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose&mdash;which are utterly beyond
our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life;
I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day
be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving,
and Which Itself was <q>with God,</q> and Which Itself is God and so
on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of phrases for it. I
seem to be on the right path, don't I? Yet would you believe it, in
the final result I don't accept this world of God's, and, although I
know it exists, I don't accept it at all. It's not that I don't accept
God, you must understand, it's the world created by Him I don't
and cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that
suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity
of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage,
like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small
Euclidian mind of man, that in the world's finale, at the moment
of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass that it
will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for
the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, of all the blood they've
shed; that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify
all that has happened with men&mdash;but though all that may come to
pass, I don't accept it. I won't accept it. Even if parallel lines do
meet and I see it myself, I shall see it and say that they've met, but
still I won't accept it. That's what's at the root of me, Alyosha;
that's my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. I began our talk
as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I've led up to my confession,
for that's all you want. You didn't want to hear about God, but
only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so I've
told you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected
feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>And why did you begin <q>as stupidly as you could</q>?</q> asked
Alyosha, looking dreamily at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations
on such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly.
And secondly, the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The
stupider one is, the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless,
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>
while intelligence wriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave,
but stupidity is honest and straightforward. I've led the conversation
to my despair, and the more stupidly I have presented it, the
better for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will explain why you don't accept the world?</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I will, it's not a secret, that's what I've been leading
up to. Dear little brother, I don't want to corrupt you or to turn
you from your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.</q>
Ivan smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had
never seen such a smile on his face before.

<head>Chapter IV. Rebellion</head>

<p>
<q>I must make you one confession,</q> Ivan began. <q>I could
never understand how one can love one's neighbors. It's just
one's neighbors, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might
love those at a distance. I once read somewhere of John the Merciful,
a saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him, he
took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and began breathing into
his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease.
I am convinced that he did that from <q>self-laceration,</q> from
the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed
by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he
must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,</q> observed
Alyosha; <q>he, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many
people not practiced in love, from loving him. But yet there's a
great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ-like love. I know
that myself, Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and
the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question
is, whether that's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's
inherent in their nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men
is a miracle impossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods.
Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely. Another can never know
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>
how much I suffer, because he is another and not I. And what's
more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's suffering (as though
it were a distinction). Why won't he admit it, do you think?
Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I
once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading,
humiliating suffering such as humbles me&mdash;hunger, for
instance&mdash;my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you
come to higher suffering&mdash;for an idea, for instance&mdash;he will very
rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all
what he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so
he deprives me instantly of his favor, and not at all from badness
of heart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show
themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can
love one's neighbors in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at
close quarters it's almost impossible. If it were as on the stage, in
the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered
lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like
looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But
enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view.
I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had
better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces
the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be.
Still we'd better keep to the children, though it does weaken my case.
But, in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters,
even when they are dirty, even when they are ugly (I fancy, though,
children never are ugly). The second reason why I won't speak of
grown-up people is that, besides being disgusting and unworthy of
love, they have a compensation&mdash;they've eaten the apple and know
good and evil, and they have become <q>like gods.</q> They go on eating
it still. But the children haven't eaten anything, and are so far
innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and
you will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too,
suffer horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers' sins,
they must be punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple;
but that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for
the heart of man here on earth. The innocent must not suffer for
another's sins, and especially such innocents! You may be surprised
at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond of children, too. And observe,
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
cruel people, the violent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are
sometimes very fond of children. Children while they are quite little&mdash;up
to seven, for instance&mdash;are so remote from grown-up people;
they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew
a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar,
murdered whole families, including several children. But when he
was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his
time at his window, watching the children playing in the prison
yard. He trained one little boy to come up to his window and made
great friends with him.... You don't know why I am telling
you all this, Alyosha? My head aches and I am sad.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak with a strange air,</q> observed Alyosha uneasily, <q>as
though you were not quite yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,</q> Ivan went
on, seeming not to hear his brother's words, <q>told me about the
crimes committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria
through fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages,
murder, outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by
the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning
they hang them&mdash;all sorts of things you can't imagine. People
talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and
insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically
cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he can do.
He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were
able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, too;
cutting the unborn child from the mother's womb, and tossing
babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets
before their mothers' eyes. Doing it before the mothers' eyes
was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that
I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her
baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They've
planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh.
They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a
pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with glee,
holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in
the baby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn't it? By
the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, what are you driving at?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>

<p>
<q>I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he
has created him in his own image and likeness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just as he did God, then?</q> observed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q><q>It's wonderful how you can turn words,</q> as Polonius says in
<hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>,</q> laughed Ivan. <q rend='pre'>You turn my words against
me. Well, I am glad. Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him in his
image and likeness. You asked just now what I was driving at.
You see, I am fond of collecting certain facts, and, would you believe,
I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and
books, and I've already got a fine collection. The Turks, of course,
have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have specimens from
home that are even better than the Turks. You know we prefer
beating&mdash;rods and scourges&mdash;that's our national institution. Nailing
ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But
the rod and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be
taken from us. Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners
are more humane, or laws have been passed, so that they don't dare
to flog men now. But they make up for it in another way just as
national as ours. And so national that it would be practically impossible
among us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it,
since the religious movement began in our aristocracy. I have a
charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how,
quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed&mdash;a
young man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and
was converted to the Christian faith at the very scaffold. This
Richard was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six
by his parents to some shepherds on the Swiss mountains. They
brought him up to work for them. He grew up like a little wild
beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and scarcely
fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in
cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite
the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had
been given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity
of feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years,
like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash
given to the pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn't
even give him that, and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And
that was how he spent all his childhood and his youth, till he grew
<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>
up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief. The savage
began to earn his living as a day laborer in Geneva. He drank what
he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by killing and robbing
an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to death. They
are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was immediately
surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods, philanthropic
ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in
prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him,
worked upon him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly
confessed his crime. He was converted. He wrote to the
court himself that he was a monster, but that in the end God had
vouchsafed him light and shown grace. All Geneva was in excitement
about him&mdash;all philanthropic and religious Geneva. All the
aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to the prison,
kissed Richard and embraced him; <q>You are our brother, you have
found grace.</q> And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion,
<q>Yes, I've found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of
pigs' food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the
Lord.</q> <q>Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must
die. Though it's not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when
you coveted the pigs' food and were beaten for stealing it (which
was very wrong of you, for stealing is forbidden); but you've shed
blood and you must die.</q> And on the last day, Richard, perfectly
limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute: <q>This is my
happiest day. I am going to the Lord.</q> <q>Yes,</q> cry the pastors and
the judges and philanthropic ladies. <q>This is the happiest day of
your life, for you are going to the Lord!</q> They all walk or drive
to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold
they call to Richard: <q>Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou
hast found grace!</q> And so, covered with his brothers' kisses, Richard
is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to the guillotine. And
they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion, because he had found
grace. Yes, that's characteristic. That pamphlet is translated into
Russian by some Russian philanthropists of aristocratic rank and
evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed gratis for the enlightenment
of the people. The case of Richard is interesting
because it's national. Though to us it's absurd to cut off a man's
head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>
we have our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical
pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines
in Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes,
<q>on its meek eyes,</q> every one must have seen it. It's peculiarly Russian.
He describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too
heavy a load and cannot move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely,
beats it at last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication
of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over and over again. <q>However
weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.</q> The nag strains,
and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature on its weeping,
on its <q>meek eyes.</q> The frantic beast tugs and draws the load,
trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort
of unnatural spasmodic action&mdash;it's awful in Nekrassov. But that's
only a horse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars
have taught us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it.
But men, too, can be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman
and his wife beat their own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven.
I have an exact account of it. The papa was glad that the birch was
covered with twigs. <q>It stings more,</q> said he, and so he began stinging
his daughter. I know for a fact there are people who at every
blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases
progressively at every blow they inflict. They beat for a
minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more
savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it
gasps, <q>Daddy! daddy!</q> By some diabolical unseemly chance the case
was brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people
have long called a barrister <q>a conscience for hire.</q> The counsel
protests in his client's defense. <q>It's such a simple thing,</q> he says,
<q>an everyday domestic event. A father corrects his child. To our
shame be it said, it is brought into court.</q> The jury, convinced by
him, give a favorable verdict. The public roars with delight that
the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn't there! I would have
proposed to raise a subscription in his honor! Charming pictures.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I've still better things about children. I've collected a
great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little
girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, <q>most worthy
and respectable people, of good education and breeding.</q> You see,
I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people,
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>
this love of torturing children, and children only. To all other types
of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like
cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting
children, even fond of children themselves in that sense.
It's just their defenselessness that tempts the tormentor, just the
angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal,
that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of course, a demon
lies hidden&mdash;the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the
screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off the
chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease,
and so on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture
by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her,
kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they
went to greater refinements of cruelty&mdash;shut her up all night in the
cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken
up at night (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound
sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her face
and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her
mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor
child's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who
can't even understand what's done to her, should beat her little aching
heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her
meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you
understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice?
Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted?
Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he
could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that
diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole
world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to <q>dear, kind
God</q>! I say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they
have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But
these little ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not
yourself. I'll leave off if you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind. I want to suffer too,</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so characteristic,
and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian
antiquities. I've forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>
in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century, and
long live the Liberator of the People! There was in those days a
general of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates, one
of those men&mdash;somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then&mdash;who, retiring
from the service into a life of leisure, are convinced that
they've earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects. There
were such men then. So our general, settled on his property of two
thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor neighbors
as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of
hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys&mdash;all mounted,
and in uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw
a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general's favorite hound.
<q>Why is my favorite dog lame?</q> He is told that the boy threw a
stone that hurt the dog's paw. <q>So you did it.</q> The general looked
the child up and down. <q>Take him.</q> He was taken&mdash;taken from
his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that morning the
general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his dependents,
dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting
parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in
front of them all stands the mother of the child. The child is
brought from the lock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day,
a capital day for hunting. The general orders the child to be undressed;
the child is stripped naked. He shivers, numb with terror,
not daring to cry.... <q>Make him run,</q> commands the general.
<q>Run! run!</q> shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... <q>At him!</q>
yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the child.
The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother's
eyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable
of administering his estates. Well&mdash;what did he deserve? To be
shot? To be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak,
Alyosha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be shot,</q> murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a
pale, twisted smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo!</q> cried Ivan, delighted. <q>If even you say so.... You're
a pretty monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart,
Alyosha Karamazov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What I said was absurd, but&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just the point, that <q>but</q>!</q> cried Ivan. <q>Let me tell you,
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>
novice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world
stands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass
in it without them. We know what we know!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand nothing,</q> Ivan went on, as though in delirium.
<q>I don't want to understand anything now. I want to stick to the
fact. I made up my mind long ago not to understand. If I try
to understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have
determined to stick to the fact.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you trying me?</q> Alyosha cried, with sudden distress.
<q>Will you say what you mean at last?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to. You
are dear to me, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up
to your Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer.
Of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked
from its crust to its center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed
my subject on purpose. I am a bug, and I recognize in all humility
that I cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is. Men
are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they
wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though they knew
they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity them. With
my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is that
there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows
effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level&mdash;but
that's only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can't consent
to live by it! What comfort is it to me that there are none
guilty and that cause follows effect simply and directly, and that
I know it?&mdash;I must have justice, or I will destroy myself. And not
justice in some remote infinite time and space, but here on earth, and
that I could see myself. I have believed in it. I want to see it, and
if I am dead by then, let me rise again, for if it all happens without
me, it will be too unfair. Surely I haven't suffered, simply that I,
my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the soil of the future
harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my own eyes
the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace
his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly understands
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>
what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are
built on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the
children, and what am I to do about them? That's a question I
can't answer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers
of questions, but I've only taken the children, because in their case
what I mean is so unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer
to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children to do with it,
tell me, please? It's beyond all comprehension why they should suffer,
and why they should pay for the harmony. Why should they,
too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future?
I understand solidarity in sin among men. I understand solidarity
in retribution, too; but there can be no such solidarity with
children. And if it is really true that they must share responsibility
for all their fathers' crimes, such a truth is not of this world and is
beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that the
child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn't
grow up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh,
Alyosha, I am not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an
upheaval of the universe it will be, when everything in heaven and
earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has
lived cries aloud: <q>Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.</q>
When the mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to the
dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears, <q>Thou art just, O Lord!</q>
then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all
will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I can't
accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take
my own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen
that if I live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps,
may cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the
child's torturer, <q>Thou art just, O Lord!</q> but I don't want to cry
aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself,
and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether. It's not worth
the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast
with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated
tears to <q>dear, kind God</q>! It's not worth it, because those
tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can be no
harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them? Is
it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good
can hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And
what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I
want to embrace. I don't want more suffering. And if the sufferings
of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary
to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth
such a price. I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor
who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her
forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for
the immeasurable suffering of her mother's heart. But the sufferings
of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive
the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is
so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there
in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive
and could forgive? I don't want harmony. From love for humanity
I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged
suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering
and unsatisfied indignation, <emph>even if I were wrong</emph>. Besides, too high
a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much
to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket,
and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as
possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept,
Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's rebellion,</q> murmured Alyosha, looking down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,</q> said Ivan earnestly.
<q>One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me
yourself, I challenge you&mdash;answer. Imagine that you are creating
a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in
the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential
and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature&mdash;that baby
beating its breast with its fist, for instance&mdash;and to found that edifice
on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on
those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I wouldn't consent,</q> said Alyosha softly.

<p>
<q>And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building
it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of
the unexpiated blood of a little victim? And accepting it would
remain happy for ever?</q>
</p>

<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>

<p>
<q>No, I can't admit it. Brother,</q> said Alyosha suddenly, with
flashing eyes, <q>you said just now, is there a being in the whole world
who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? But there
is a Being and He can forgive everything, all and for all, because
He gave His innocent blood for all and everything. You have forgotten
Him, and on Him is built the edifice, and it is to Him they
cry aloud, <q>Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten
Him; on the contrary I've been wondering all the time how
it was you did not bring Him in before, for usually all arguments
on your side put Him in the foreground. Do you know, Alyosha&mdash;don't
laugh! I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste
another ten minutes on me, I'll tell it to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You wrote a poem?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, I didn't write it,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>and I've never written
two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose
and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You
will be my first reader&mdash;that is listener. Why should an author
forego even one listener?</q> smiled Ivan. <q>Shall I tell it to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am all attention,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>My poem is called <q>The Grand Inquisitor</q>; it's a ridiculous thing,
but I want to tell it to you.</q>

<head>Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor</head>

<p>
<q>Even this must have a preface&mdash;that is, a literary preface,</q>
laughed Ivan, <q rend='pre'>and I am a poor hand at making one. You
see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that
time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry
to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante,
in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to
give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the
angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those
days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo's <hi rend='italic'>Notre Dame de
Paris</hi> an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>
in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor
of the birth of the dauphin. It was called <hi rend='italic'>Le bon jugement de la
très sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie</hi>, and she appears herself on the
stage and pronounces her <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bon jugement</foreign>.
Similar plays, chiefly from the Old Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too,
up to the times of Peter the Great. But besides plays there were
all sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world, in which
the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when
required. In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating,
copying, and even composing such poems&mdash;and even under
the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of course, from
the Greek), <hi rend='italic'>The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell</hi>, with
descriptions as bold as Dante's. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel
Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners
and their punishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy
set of sinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom
of the lake so that they can't swim out, and <q>these God forgets</q>&mdash;an
expression of extraordinary depth and force. And so Our
Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the throne of God and begs
for mercy for all in hell&mdash;for all she has seen there, indiscriminately.
Her conversation with God is immensely interesting. She beseeches
Him, she will not desist, and when God points to the hands and feet
of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, <q>How can I forgive His
tormentors?</q> she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all the angels
and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all
without distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite
of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the
sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting,
<q>Thou art just, O Lord, in this judgment.</q> Well, my poem would
have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time. He comes
on the scene in my poem, but He says nothing, only appears and
passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed since He promised to come
in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet wrote, <q>Behold, I
come quickly</q>; <q>Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither
the Son, but the Father,</q> as He Himself predicted on earth. But
humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love.
Oh, with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased
to see signs from heaven.</q>

<p>
There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is
true there were many miracles in those days. There were saints
who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to
their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But
the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among
men of the truth of these miracles. And just then there appeared
in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. <q>A huge star like
to a torch</q> (that is, to a church) <q>fell on the sources of the waters
and they became bitter.</q> These heretics began blasphemously denying
miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more
ardent in their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as
before, awaited His coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to
suffer and die for Him as before. And so many ages mankind had
prayed with faith and fervor, <q>O Lord our God, hasten Thy coming,</q>
so many ages called upon Him, that in His infinite mercy He
deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He had
come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits,
as is written in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute
faith in the truth of his words, bore witness that
</p>

<l>Weary and worn, the Heavenly King</l>

<l>And through our land went wandering.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
And that certainly was so, I assure you.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people,
to the tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him
like children. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible
time of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to
the glory of God, and <q>in the splendid <foreign rend='italic'>auto da
fé</foreign> the wicked heretics
were burnt.</q> Oh, of course, this was not the coming in which
He will appear according to His promise at the end of time in all
His heavenly glory, and which will be sudden <q>as lightning flashing
from east to west.</q> No, He visited His children only for a moment,
and there where the flames were crackling round the heretics.
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>
In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in that human
shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteen centuries
ago. He came down to the <q>hot pavements</q> of the southern
town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, <foreign
lang='la' rend='italic'>ad majorem gloriam Dei</foreign>,
been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent
<foreign rend='italic'>auto da fé</foreign>, in the presence of the king, the
court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming ladies of the
court, and the whole population of Seville.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one
recognized Him. That might be one of the best passages in the
poem. I mean, why they recognized Him. The people are irresistibly
drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him,
follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile
of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, light
and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people,
stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands
to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact
with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd,
blind from childhood, cries out, <q>O Lord, heal me and I shall see
Thee!</q> and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man
sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet.
Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. <q>It is
He&mdash;it is He!</q> all repeat. <q>It must be He, it can be no one but
Him!</q> He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment
when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin.
In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent
citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. <q>He will raise your
child,</q> the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming
to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of
the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. <q>If it is Thou,
raise my child!</q> she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession
halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks
with compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, <q>Maiden,
arise!</q> and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and
looks round, smiling with wide-open wondering eyes, holding a
bunch of white roses they had put in her hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that
moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the
<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>
cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a
withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of
light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was
the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman
Church&mdash;at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old, monk's cassock.
At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and
slaves and the <q>holy guard.</q> He stops at the sight of the crowd and
watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the
coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens.
He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire.
He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is
his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and
trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes
way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay
hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down
to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the
people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to
the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy
Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed
by the dark, burning, <q>breathless</q> night of Seville. The air is <q>fragrant
with laurel and lemon.</q> In the pitch darkness the iron door
of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself
comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at
once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or
two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on
the table and speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Is it Thou? Thou?</q> but receiving no answer, he adds at once,
<q>Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know
too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add
anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou
come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou
knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be to-morrow? I
know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou
or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee
and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very
people who have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest
sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest
Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,</q> he added with thoughtful
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>
penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?</q> Alyosha,
who had been listening in silence, said with a smile. <q>Is it simply
a wild fantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man&mdash;some impossible
<foreign rend='italic'>quiproquo</foreign>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it as the last,</q> said Ivan, laughing, <q>if you are so corrupted
by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic. If
you like it to be a case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,</q>
he went on, laughing, <q>the old man was ninety, and he might well
be crazy over his set idea. He might have been struck by the appearance
of the Prisoner. It might, in fact, be simply his ravings,
the delusion of an old man of ninety, over-excited
by the <foreign rend='italic'>auto da fé</foreign>
of a hundred heretics the day before. But does it matter to us after
all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy? All that
matters is that the old man should speak out, should speak openly of
what he has thought in silence for ninety years.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not
say a word?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's inevitable in any case,</q> Ivan laughed again. <q>The old
man has told Him He hasn't the right to add anything to what He
has said of old. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of
Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. <q>All has been given by
Thee to the Pope,</q> they say, <q>and all, therefore, is still in the Pope's
hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all. Thou
must not meddle for the time, at least.</q> That's how they speak and
write too&mdash;the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read it myself in the
works of their theologians. <q>Hast Thou the right to reveal to us
one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come?</q>
my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. <q>No,
Thou hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said
of old, and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst
exalt when Thou wast on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew
will encroach on men's freedom of faith; for it will be manifest
as a miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than
anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago. Didst Thou not
often say then, <q>I will make you free</q>? But now Thou hast seen
these <q>free</q> men,</q> the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile.
<q>Yes, we've paid dearly for it,</q> he goes on, looking sternly at Him,
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>
<q>but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen
centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is
ended and over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over for
good? Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be
wroth with me. But let me tell Thee that now, to-day, people are
more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom, yet they
have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet.
But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst? Was this
Thy freedom?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand again,</q> Alyosha broke in. <q>Is he ironical, is
he jesting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his
Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done
so to make men happy. <q>For now</q> (he is speaking of the Inquisition,
of course) <q>for the first time it has become possible to think of the
happiness of men. Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels
be happy? Thou wast warned,</q> he says to Him. <q>Thou hast had
no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst not listen to
those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men
might be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst
hand on the work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established
by Thy word, Thou hast given to us the right to bind and
to unbind, and now, of course, Thou canst not think of taking it
away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder us?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what's the meaning of <q>no lack of admonitions and warnings</q>?</q>
asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and
non-existence,</q>
the old man goes on, <q rend='pre'>the great spirit talked with Thee in
the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he <q>tempted</q>
Thee. Is that so? And could anything truer be said than what he
revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject, and
what in the books is called <q>the temptation</q>? And yet if there
has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle, it took place on
that day, on the day of the three temptations. The statement of
those three questions was itself the miracle. If it were possible to
imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions
of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books, and that we
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>
had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to do so had gathered
together all the wise men of the earth&mdash;rulers, chief priests,
learned men, philosophers, poets&mdash;and had set them the task to invent
three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but
express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history
of the world and of humanity&mdash;dost Thou believe that all the
wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth
and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to
Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness? From
those questions alone, from the miracle of their statement, we can
see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence,
but with the absolute and eternal. For in those three questions the
whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together
into one whole, and foretold, and in them are united all the unsolved
historical contradictions of human nature. At the time it could not
be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that fifteen
hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three
questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly
fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>Judge Thyself who was right&mdash;Thou or he who questioned
Thee then? Remember the first question; its meaning, in other
words, was this: <q>Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going
with empty hands, with some promise of freedom which men in
their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand,
which they fear and dread&mdash;for nothing has ever been more insupportable
for a man and a human society than freedom. But seest
Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness? Turn
them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of
sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest Thou
withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.</q> But Thou wouldst
not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking,
what is that freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread?
Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou
know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth
will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome
Thee, and all will follow him, crying, <q>Who can compare with this
beast? He has given us fire from heaven!</q> Dost Thou know that
the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>
sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only
hunger? <q>Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!</q> that's what
they'll write on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and
with which they will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood
will rise a new building; the terrible tower of Babel will be built
again, and though, like the one of old, it will not be finished, yet
Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short
the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come back
to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower. They will
seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall
be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to us,
<q>Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't
given it!</q> And then we shall finish building their tower, for he
finishes the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them
in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never,
never can they feed themselves without us! No science will give
them bread so long as they remain free. In the end they will lay
their freedom at our feet, and say to us, <q>Make us your slaves, but
feed us.</q> They will understand themselves, at last, that freedom
and bread enough for all are inconceivable together, for never, never
will they be able to share between them! They will be convinced,
too, that they can never be free, for they are weak, vicious, worthless
and rebellious. Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven,
but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes
of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if for the
sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is
to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures
who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread
for the sake of the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens
of thousands of the great and strong, while the millions, numerous
as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love Thee, must exist only
for the sake of the great and strong? No, we care for the weak
too. They are sinful and rebellious, but in the end they too will
become obedient. They will marvel at us and look on us as gods, because
we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so
dreadful and to rule over them&mdash;so awful it will seem to them to be
free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule
them in Thy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
Thee come to us again. That deception will be our suffering, for we
shall be forced to lie.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>This is the significance of the first question in the
wilderness, and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom
which Thou hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies
hid the great secret of this world. Choosing <q>bread,</q> Thou wouldst
have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity&mdash;to
find some one to worship. So long as man remains free he strives
for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to
worship. But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute,
so that all men would agree at once to worship it. For these
pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other
can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and
worship; what is essential is that all may be <emph>together</emph> in it. This
craving for <emph>community</emph> of worship is the chief misery of every man
individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For
the sake of common worship they've slain each other with the
sword. They have set up gods and challenged one another, <q>Put
away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and
your gods!</q> And so it will be to the end of the world, even when
gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols
just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but have known,
this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject the
one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow
down to Thee alone&mdash;the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast
rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold
what Thou didst further. And all again in the name of freedom!
I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find
some one quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom
with which the ill-fated creature is born. But only one who can
appease their conscience can take over their freedom. In bread there
was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread, and man will
worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if some
one else gains possession of his conscience&mdash;oh! then he will cast
away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience.
In that Thou wast right. For the secret of man's being is
not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable
conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>
on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth,
though he had bread in abundance. That is true. But what happened?
Instead of taking men's freedom from them, Thou didst
make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man prefers
peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of
good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom
of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,
instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience
of man at rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional,
vague and enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond
the strength of men, acting as though Thou didst not love them at
all&mdash;Thou who didst come to give Thy life for them! Instead of
taking possession of men's freedom, Thou didst increase it, and burdened
the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever.
Thou didst desire man's free love, that he should follow Thee freely,
enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the rigid ancient
law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is
good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his
guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even
Thy image and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful
burden of free choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth
is not in Thee, for they could not have been left in greater confusion
and suffering than Thou hast caused, laying upon them so many
cares and unanswerable problems.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for
the destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it.
Yet what was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers
alone, able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience
of these impotent rebels for their happiness&mdash;those forces are miracle,
mystery and authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast
set the example for doing so. When the wise and dread spirit set
Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee, <q>If Thou
wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself
down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up lest he
fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou
art the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in
Thy Father.</q> But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself
down. Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and well, like God;
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>
but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods? Oh, Thou
didst know then that in taking one step, in making one movement
to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have
lost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces
against that earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise
spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are
there many like Thee? And couldst Thou believe for one moment
that men, too, could face such a temptation? Is the nature
of men such, that they can reject miracle, and at the great
moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing
spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?
Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books,
would be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the
earth, and Thou didst hope that man, following Thee, would cling
to God and not ask for a miracle. But Thou didst not know that
when man rejects miracle he rejects God too; for man seeks not so
much God as the miraculous. And as man cannot bear to be without
the miraculous, he will create new miracles of his own for himself,
and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft, though he
might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou
didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee,
mocking and reviling Thee, <q>Come down from the cross and we will
believe that Thou art He.</q> Thou didst not come down, for again
Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and didst crave faith
given freely, not based on miracle. Thou didst crave for free love
and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has
overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highly of men
therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by nature.
Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon
them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is
weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he,
can he do what Thou didst? By showing him so much respect,
Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him, for Thou didst ask far
too much from him&mdash;Thou who hast loved him more than Thyself!
Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less of him. That
would have been more like love, for his burden would have been
lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now
rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>
pride of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting
and barring out the teacher at school. But their childish delight will
end; it will cost them dear. They will cast down temples and
drench the earth with blood. But they will see at last, the foolish
children, that, though they are rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable
to keep up their own rebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears,
they will recognize at last that He who created them rebels must
have meant to mock at them. They will say this in despair, and
their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make them more
unhappy still, for man's nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in the
end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and
unhappiness&mdash;that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear
so much for their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in
image, that he saw all those who took part in the first resurrection
and that there were of each tribe twelve thousand. But if there
were so many of them, they must have been not men but gods.
They had borne Thy cross, they had endured scores of years in the
barren, hungry wilderness, living upon locusts and roots&mdash;and Thou
mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of
free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy name. But remember
that they were only some thousands; and what of the rest? And
how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not endure
what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that
it is unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply
come to the elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and
we cannot understand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right
to preach a mystery, and to teach them that it's not the free judgment
of their hearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which
they must follow blindly, even against their conscience. So we have
done. We have corrected Thy work and have founded it upon
<emph>miracle</emph>, <emph>mystery</emph> and <emph>authority</emph>. And men rejoiced
that they were again led like sheep, and that the terrible gift that had brought them
such suffering was, at last, lifted from their hearts. Were we right
teaching them this? Speak! Did we not love mankind, so meekly
acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly lightening their burden,
and permitting their weak nature even sin with our sanction? Why
hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look
silently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
don't want Thy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for
me to hide anything from Thee? Don't I know to Whom I am
speaking? All that I can say is known to Thee already. And is it
for me to conceal from Thee our mystery? Perhaps it is Thy will
to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not working with
Thee, but with <emph>him</emph>&mdash;that is our mystery. It's long&mdash;eight
centuries&mdash;since we have been on <emph>his</emph> side and not on Thine. Just
eight centuries ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn,
that last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of
the earth. We took from him Rome and the sword of Cæsar, and
proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth, though hitherto we
have not been able to complete our work. But whose fault is that?
Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has begun. It has long to
await completion and the earth has yet much to suffer, but we
shall triumph and shall be Cæsars, and then we shall plan the universal
happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then
the sword of Cæsar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst
Thou accepted that last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst
have accomplished all that man seeks on earth&mdash;that is, some one to
worship, some one to keep his conscience, and some means of uniting
all in one unanimous and harmonious ant-heap, for the craving
for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men. Mankind
as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state. There
have been many great nations with great histories, but the more
highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for they
felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide
union. The great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans,
whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue
its people, and they too were but the unconscious expression of the
same craving for universal unity. Hadst Thou taken the world and
Cæsar's purple, Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and
have given universal peace. For who can rule men if not he who
holds their conscience and their bread in his hands? We have taken
the sword of Cæsar, and in taking it, of course, have rejected Thee
and followed <emph>him</emph>. Oh, ages are yet to come of the confusion of
free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having begun
to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,
with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>
feet and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon
the beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written, <q>Mystery.</q>
But then, and only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come
for men. Thou art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the
elect, while we give rest to all. And besides, how many of those
elect, those mighty ones who could become elect, have grown weary
waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will transfer the powers
of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp, and
end by raising their <emph>free</emph> banner against Thee. Thou didst Thyself
lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will no
more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we
shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce
their freedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right
or shall we be lying? They will be convinced that we are right,
for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to
which Thy freedom brought them. Freedom, free thought and
science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face
to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of
them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious
but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and
unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: <q>Yes,
you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back
to you, save us from ourselves!</q></q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the
bread made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without
any miracle. They will see that we do not change the stones to
bread, but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from
our hands than for the bread itself! For they will remember only
too well that in old days, without our help, even the bread they
made turned to stones in their hands, while since they have come
back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in their hands.
Too, too well will they know the value of complete submission!
And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to
blame for their not knowing it?&mdash;speak! Who scattered the flock
and sent it astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come
together again and will submit once more, and then it will be once
for all. Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of
weak creatures such as they are by nature. Oh, we shall persuade
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>
them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst lift them up and
thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them that they
are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike
happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will
look to us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They
will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be
proud at our being so powerful and clever, that we have been able
to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions. They
will tremble impotently before our wrath, their minds will grow
fearful, they will be quick to shed tears like women and children,
but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter
and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes, we shall set
them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their life
like a child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance. Oh,
we shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they
will love us like children because we allow them to sin. We shall
tell them that every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission,
that we allow them to sin because we love them, and the
punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves. And we shall take
it upon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviors who have
taken on themselves their sins before God. And they will have no
secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them to live with their
wives and mistresses, to have or not to have children&mdash;according to
whether they have been obedient or disobedient&mdash;and they will submit
to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of their
conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer
for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will
save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure
at present in making a free decision for themselves. And all will be
happy, all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand
who rule over them. For only we, we who guard the mystery, shall
be unhappy. There will be thousands of millions of happy babes,
and a hundred thousand sufferers who have taken upon themselves
the curse of the knowledge of good and evil. Peacefully they will
die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and beyond the grave
they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the secret, and
for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven
and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world,
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
it certainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that
Thou wilt come again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen,
the proud and strong, but we will say that they have only saved
themselves, but we have saved all. We are told that the harlot
who sits upon the beast, and holds in her hands the <emph>mystery</emph>, shall
be put to shame, that the weak will rise up again, and will rend her
royal purple and will strip naked her loathsome body. But then I
will stand up and point out to Thee the thousand millions of happy
children who have known no sin. And we who have taken their
sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and say:
<q>Judge us if Thou canst and darest.</q> Know that I fear Thee not.
Know that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on
roots and locusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast
blessed men, and I too was striving to stand among Thy elect, among
the strong and powerful, thirsting <q>to make up the number.</q> But
I awakened and would not serve madness. I turned back and joined
the ranks of those <emph>who have corrected Thy work</emph>. I left the proud
and went back to the humble, for the happiness of the humble.
What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will be
built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock
who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about
the pile on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For
if any one has ever deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I
shall burn Thee. <hi rend='italic'>Dixi.</hi></q></q>

<p>
Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with
excitement; when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly
moved and seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but
restrained himself. Now his words came with a rush.
</p>

<p>
<q>But ... that's absurd!</q> he cried, flushing. <q>Your poem is in
praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him&mdash;as you meant it to be. And
who will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand
it? That's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church....
That's Rome, and not even the whole of Rome, it's false&mdash;those are
the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!... And
there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor.
What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who are
these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>
for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen?
We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not
what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They
are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world
in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that's
their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about
it.... It's simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination&mdash;something
like a universal serfdom with them as masters&mdash;that's
all they stand for. They don't even believe in God perhaps.
Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, stay,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>how hot you are! A fantasy you
say, let it be so! Of course it's a fantasy. But allow me to say: do
you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last
centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly
gain? Is that Father Païssy's teaching?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, on the contrary, Father Païssy did once say something
rather the same as you ... but of course it's not the same, not a
bit the same,</q> Alyosha hastily corrected himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>A precious admission, in spite of your <q>not a bit the same.</q> I
ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile
material gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed
by great sorrow and loving humanity? You see, only suppose
that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing
but filthy material gain&mdash;if there's only one like my old
Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made
frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and perfect.
But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyes were
opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain
perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction
that millions of God's creatures have been created as a mockery,
that they will never be capable of using their freedom, that these
poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower, that
it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his dream
of harmony. Seeing all that he turned back and joined&mdash;the clever
people. Surely that could have happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Joined whom, what clever people?</q> cried Alyosha, completely
carried away. <q>They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries
and secrets.... Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
secret. Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, that's his secret!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It's perfectly
true, it's true that that's the whole secret, but isn't that suffering,
at least for a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the
desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity?
In his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the
advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of
life for the feeble, unruly, <q>incomplete, empirical creatures created
in jest.</q> And so, convinced of this, he sees that he must follow the
counsel of the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction,
and therefore accept lying and deception, and lead men consciously
to death and destruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that
they may not notice where they are being led, that the poor blind
creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy. And
note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose ideal the old
man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that tragic?
And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army <q>filled
with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain</q>&mdash;would not
one such be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such
standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of
the Roman Church with all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea.
I tell you frankly that I firmly believe that there has always been
such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement.
Who knows, there may have been some such even among the Roman
Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man
who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found
even now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by
chance but by agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for
the guarding of the mystery, to guard it from the weak and the
unhappy, so as to make them happy. No doubt it is so, and so it
must be indeed. I fancy that even among the Masons there's something
of the same mystery at the bottom, and that that's why the
Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity
of the idea, while it is so essential that there should be one flock
and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea I might
be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are perhaps a Mason yourself!</q> broke suddenly from
Alyosha. <q>You don't believe in God,</q> he added, speaking this time
<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>
very sorrowfully. He fancied besides that his brother was looking
at him ironically. <q>How does your poem end?</q> he asked, suddenly
looking down. <q>Or was it the end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking
he waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence
weighed down upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened
intently all the time, looking gently in his face and evidently not
wishing to reply. The old man longed for Him to say something,
however bitter and terrible. But He suddenly approached the
old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips.
That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His lips moved.
He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: <q>Go, and come
no more ... come not at all, never, never!</q> And he let Him out
into the dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the old man?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his
idea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you with him, you too?</q> cried Alyosha, mournfully.
</p>

<p>
Ivan laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's all nonsense, Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of a
senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do
you take it so seriously? Surely you don't suppose I am going
straight off to the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His
work? Good Lord, it's no business of mine. I told you, all I want
is to live on to thirty, and then ... dash the cup to the ground!</q>
</p>
