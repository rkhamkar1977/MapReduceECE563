savories, pies, and sweets&mdash;bring them all up at once. That box
Andrey has got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand
champagne immediately. And the girls, we must have the girls,
Marya especially.</q>
</p>

<p>
He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here, Andrey, let's settle. Here's fifteen roubles for the drive,
and fifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love....
Remember Karamazov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm afraid, sir,</q> faltered Andrey. <q>Give me five roubles extra,
but more I won't take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive
my foolish words ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you afraid of?</q> asked Mitya, scanning him. <q>Well,
go to the devil, if that's it!</q> he cried, flinging him five roubles.
<q>Now, Trifon Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get
a look at them, so that they don't see me. Where are they? In the
blue room?</q>
</p>

<p>
Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once
<pb n='467'/><anchor id='Pg467'/>
obediently did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went
himself into the first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors
were sitting, and took the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya
in, and put him in a corner in the dark, whence he could freely
watch the company without being seen. But Mitya did not look
long, and, indeed, he could not see them, he saw her, his heart
throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside
her, on the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding
his hand and seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and
not looking at her, was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov,
who sat the other side of the table, facing Grushenka.
Maximov was laughing violently at something. On the sofa sat <emph>he</emph>,
and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger. The one on
the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had an
impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was
apparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger,
struck Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing
more. He caught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute,
he put the pistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he
walked, feeling cold all over, straight into the blue room to face the
company.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie!</q> shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.
</p>

</div>

<div>

<p>
With his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the
table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering
at every word, <q>I ... I'm all right! Don't be afraid!</q> he
exclaimed, <q>I&mdash;there's nothing the matter,</q> he turned suddenly to
Grushenka, who had shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov,
and clasped his hand tightly. <q>I ... I'm coming, too. I'm here
till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with you till morning? Only
till morning, for the last time, in this same room?</q>
</p>

<pb n='468'/><anchor id='Pg468'/>

<p>
So he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting
on the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity
and observed severely:
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie</foreign>, we're here in private. There are other
rooms.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?</q>
answered Kalganov suddenly. <q>Sit down with us. How are you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always
thought a lot of you.</q> Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at
once holding out his hand across the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,</q>
laughed Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>He always squeezes like that, always,</q> Grushenka put in gayly,
with a timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face
that he was not going to make a scene. She was watching him with
intense curiosity and still some uneasiness. She was impressed by
something about him, and indeed the last thing she expected of him
was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good evening,</q> Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya
rushed up to him, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good evening. You're here, too! How glad I am to find you
here, too! Gentlemen, gentlemen, I&mdash;</q> (He addressed the Polish
gentleman with the pipe again, evidently taking him for the most
important person present.) <q>I flew here.... I wanted to spend
my last day, my last hour in this room, in this very room ...
where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,
<foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q> he
cried wildly, <q>I flew here and vowed&mdash; Oh, don't be afraid, it's my
last night! Let's drink to our good understanding. They'll bring
the wine at once.... I brought this with me.</q> (Something made
him pull out his bundle of notes.) <q>Allow me, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>!
I want to have music, singing, a revel, as we had before. But the worm, the
unnecessary worm, will crawl away, and there'll be no more of him.
I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted
to say, but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips.
The Pole gazed fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand;
looked at Grushenka, and was in evident perplexity.
</p>

<p>
<q>If my suverin lady is permitting&mdash;</q> he was beginning.
</p>

<p>
<q>What does <q>suverin</q> mean? <q>Sovereign,</q> I suppose?</q> interrupted
<pb n='469'/><anchor id='Pg469'/>
Grushenka. <q>I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit
down, Mitya, what are you talking about? Don't frighten us,
please. You won't frighten us, will you? If you won't, I am glad
to see you ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Me, me frighten you?</q> cried Mitya, flinging up his hands.
<q>Oh, pass me by, go your way, I won't hinder you!...</q>
</p>

<p>
And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as
well, by flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning
his head away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back
of the chair tight, as though embracing it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, come, what a fellow you are!</q> cried Grushenka reproachfully.
<q>That's just how he comes to see me&mdash;he begins talking, and
I can't make out what he means. He cried like that once before,
and now he's crying again! It's shameful! Why are you crying?
<emph>As though you had anything to cry for!</emph></q> she added enigmatically,
emphasizing each word with some irritability.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... I'm not crying.... Well, good evening!</q> He instantly
turned round in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his
abrupt wooden laugh, but a long, quivering, inaudible nervous
laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!</q>
Grushenka said to him persuasively. <q>I'm very glad you've come,
very glad, Mitya, do you hear, I'm very glad! I want him to stay
here with us,</q> she said peremptorily, addressing the whole company,
though her words were obviously meant for the man sitting on the
sofa. <q>I wish it, I wish it! And if he goes away I shall go, too!</q>
she added with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>What my queen commands is law!</q> pronounced the Pole, gallantly
kissing Grushenka's hand. <q>I beg you, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,
to join our company,</q> he added politely, addressing Mitya.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering
another tirade, but the words did not come.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's drink, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
he blurted out instead of making a speech.
Every one laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!</q> Grushenka
exclaimed nervously. <q>Do you hear, Mitya,</q> she went on
insistently, <q>don't prance about, but it's nice you've brought the
champagne. I want some myself, and I can't bear liqueurs. And
<pb n='470'/><anchor id='Pg470'/>
best of all, you've come yourself. We were fearfully dull here....
You've come for a spree again, I suppose? But put your money
in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled
bundle of notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were
fixed. In confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He
flushed. At that moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked
bottle of champagne, and glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up
the bottle, but he was so bewildered that he did not know what to
do with it. Kalganov took it from him and poured out the champagne.
</p>

<p>
<q>Another! Another bottle!</q> Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and,
forgetting to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly
invited to drink to their good understanding, he drank off his glass
without waiting for any one else. His whole countenance suddenly
changed. The solemn and tragic expression with which he had
entered vanished completely, and a look of something childlike came
into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued.
He looked shyly and happily at every one, with a continual
nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who has
done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten
everything, and was looking round at every one with a
childlike smile of delight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually,
and bringing his chair close up to her. By degrees he had
gained some idea of the two Poles, though he had formed no definite
conception of them yet.
</p>

<p>
The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and
his Polish accent; and, above all, by his pipe. <q>Well, what of it?
It's a good thing he's smoking a pipe,</q> he reflected. The Pole's
puffy, middle-aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin,
pointed, dyed and impudent-looking mustaches, had not so far
roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not even particularly
struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with love-locks
foolishly combed forward over the temples. <q>I suppose it's all right
since he wears a wig,</q> he went on, musing blissfully. The other,
younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company
and listening to the conversation with silent contempt, still
only impressed Mitya by his great height, which was in striking
<pb n='471'/><anchor id='Pg471'/>
contrast to the Pole on the sofa. <q>If he stood up he'd be six foot
three.</q> The thought flitted through Mitya's mind. It occurred
to him, too, that this Pole must be the friend of the other, as it
were, a <q>bodyguard,</q> and no doubt the big Pole was at the disposal
of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed to Mitya perfectly
right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglike submissiveness
all feeling of rivalry had died away.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words
he completely failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling
heart, was that she was kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and
made him sit by her. He was beside himself with delight, watching
her sip her glass of champagne. The silence of the company seemed
somehow to strike him, however, and he looked round at every one
with expectant eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don't you
begin doing something?</q> his smiling eyes seemed to ask.
</p>

<p>
<q>He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,</q> Kalganov
began suddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing
to Maximov.
</p>

<p>
Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's talking nonsense?</q> he laughed, his short, wooden laugh,
seeming suddenly delighted at something&mdash;<q>ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry
officers in the twenties married Polish women. That's awful rot,
isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Polish women?</q> repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.
</p>

<p>
Kalganov was well aware of Mitya's attitude to Grushenka, and
he guessed about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest
him, perhaps did not interest him at all; what he was interested in
was Maximov. He had come here with Maximov by chance, and
he met the Poles here at the inn for the first time in his life. Grushenka
he knew before, and had once been with some one to see
her; but she had not taken to him. But here she looked at him
very affectionately: before Mitya's arrival, she had been making
much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He
was a boy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very
charming fair-skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his
fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and
<pb n='472'/><anchor id='Pg472'/>
sometimes even deep expression, beyond his age indeed, although
the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a child,
and was not at all ashamed of it, even when he was aware of it himself.
As a rule he was very willful, even capricious, though always
friendly. Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his
expression. He would look at you and listen, seeming all the while
to be persistently dreaming over something else. Often he was listless
and lazy, at other times he would grow excited, sometimes,
apparently, over the most trivial matters.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only imagine, I've been taking him about with me for the last
four days,</q> he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally
though, without the slightest affectation. <q>Ever since your
brother, do you remember, shoved him off the carriage and sent
him flying. That made me take an interest in him at the time, and
I took him into the country, but he keeps talking such rot I'm
ashamed to be with him. I'm taking him back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is
impossible,</q> the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.
</p>

<p>
He spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended.
If he used Russian words, he always distorted them into a
Polish form.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I was married to a Polish lady myself,</q> tittered Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the
cavalry. Were you a cavalry officer?</q> put in Kalganov at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!</q> cried Mitya, listening
eagerly, and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as
though there were no knowing what he might hear from each.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you see,</q> Maximov turned to him. <q>What I mean is that
those pretty Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with
our Uhlans ... when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan
she jumps on his knee like a kitten ... a little white one ...
and the <hi rend='italic'>pan</hi>-father and <hi rend='italic'>pan</hi>-mother
look on and allow it....
They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes and offers her his
hand.... That's how it is ... offers her his hand, he he!</q> Maximov
ended, tittering.
</p>

<p>
<q>The <hi rend='italic'>pan</hi> is a <hi rend='italic'>lajdak</hi>!</q>
the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly
and crossed one leg over the other. Mitya's eye was caught
<pb n='473'/><anchor id='Pg473'/>
by his huge greased boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of
both the Poles looked rather greasy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now it's <hi rend='italic'>lajdak</hi>! What's he scolding about?</q>
said Grushenka, suddenly vexed.
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Pani</hi> Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant
girls, and not ladies of good birth,</q> the Pole with the pipe
observed to Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can reckon on that,</q> the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It
makes it cheerful,</q> Grushenka said crossly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not hindering them, <hi rend='italic'>pani</hi>,</q> said the Pole in the wig,
with a long look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he
sucked his pipe again.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.</q> Kalganov got
excited again, as though it were a question of vast import. <q>He's
never been in Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you
weren't married in Poland, were you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought
her to Russia before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her
aunt, and another female relation with a grown-up son. He brought
her straight from Poland and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant
in our regiment, a very nice young man. At first he meant
to marry her himself. But he didn't marry her, because she turned
out to be lame.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you married a lame woman?</q> cried Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed
it. I thought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I
thought it was for fun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So pleased she was going to marry you!</q> yelled Kalganov, in a
ringing, childish voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.
Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very
evening, she confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. <q>I
once jumped over a puddle when I was a child,</q> she said, <q>and injured
my leg.</q> He he!</q>
</p>

<p>
Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling
on the sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle
of happiness.
</p>

<pb n='474'/><anchor id='Pg474'/>

<p>
<q>Do you know, that's the truth, he's not lying now,</q> exclaimed
Kalganov, turning to Mitya; <q>and do you know, he's been married
twice; it's his first wife he's talking about. But his second wife, do
you know, ran away, and is alive now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it possible?</q> said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with
an expression of the utmost astonishment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. She did run away. I've had that unpleasant experience,</q>
Maximov modestly assented, <q>with a
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>monsieur</foreign>. And what was
worse, she'd had all my little property transferred to her beforehand.
<q>You're an educated man,</q> she said to me. <q>You can always
get your living.</q> She settled my business with that. A venerable
bishop once said to me: <q>One of your wives was lame, but the other
was too light-footed.</q> He he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, listen!</q> cried Kalganov, bubbling over, <q>if he's telling
lies&mdash;and he often is&mdash;he's only doing it to amuse us all. There's
no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He's
awfully low, but it's natural to him, eh? Don't you think so?
Some people are low from self-interest, but he's simply so, from
nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the
way yesterday) that Gogol wrote <hi rend='italic'>Dead Souls</hi> about him. Do you
remember, there's a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov
thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, <q>for inflicting
bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken
condition.</q> Would you believe it, he claims that he was that
Maximov and that he was beaten! Now can it be so? Tchitchikov
made his journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of the twenties,
so that the dates don't fit. He couldn't have been thrashed
then, he couldn't, could he?</q>
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but
his excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without
protest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, but if they did thrash him!</q> he cried, laughing.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is&mdash;</q>
put in Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What o'clock is it, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?</q>
the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall
friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders
in reply. Neither of them had a watch.
</p>

<pb n='475'/><anchor id='Pg475'/>

<p>
<q>Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn't other people
talk because you're bored?</q> Grushenka flew at him with evident
intention of finding fault. Something seemed for the first time to
flash upon Mitya's mind. This time the Pole answered with unmistakable
irritability.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign>, I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right then. Come, tell us your story,</q> Grushenka cried to
Maximov. <q>Why are you all silent?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish,</q> answered Maximov at
once, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. <q>Besides, all that's
by way of allegory in Gogol, for he's made all the names have a
meaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had
quite a different name, he was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really
was called Fenardi, only he wasn't an Italian but a Russian, and
Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in
tights, and she had a little short skirt with spangles, and she kept
turning round and round, only not for four hours but for four
minutes only, and she bewitched every one...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what were you beaten for?</q> cried Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>For Piron!</q> answered Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Piron?</q> cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then,
a big party of us, in a tavern at that very fair. They'd invited me,
and first of all I began quoting epigrams. <q>Is that you, Boileau?
What a funny get-up!</q> and Boileau answers that he's going to a
masquerade, that is to the baths, he he! And they took it to themselves,
so I made haste to repeat another, very sarcastic, well known
to all educated people:</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!</l>
<l>But one grief is weighing on me.</l>
<l>You don't know your way to the sea!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most
unseemly way for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things
right, I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how
he was not accepted into the French Academy, and to revenge
himself wrote his own epitaph:
</p>

<pb n='476'/><anchor id='Pg476'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Ci-gît Piron qui ne fut rien,</l>
<l>Pas même académicien.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>They seized me and thrashed me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what for? What for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,</q>
Maximov concluded, briefly and sententiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Eh, that's enough! That's all stupid, I don't want to listen. I
thought it would be amusing,</q> Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose
upon his feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out
of his element, began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his
hands behind his back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, he can't sit still,</q> said Grushenka, looking at him contemptuously.
Mitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides,
that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable
expression.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie!</foreign></q>
cried Mitya, <q>let's drink! and the other <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign>, too! Let
us drink.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them
with champagne.
</p>

<p>
<q>To Poland, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>,
I drink to your Poland!</q> cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be delighted, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
said the Pole on the sofa, with dignity
and affable condescension, and he took his glass.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the other <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign>,
what's his name? Drink, most illustrious,
take your glass!</q> Mitya urged.
</p>

<p>
<q>Pan Vrublevsky,</q> put in the Pole on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.
</p>

<p>
<q>To Poland, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie!</foreign></q>
cried Mitya, raising his glass. <q>Hurrah!</q>
</p>

<p>
All three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out
three glasses.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now to Russia, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>, and let us be brothers!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pour out some for us,</q> said Grushenka; <q>I'll drink to Russia,
too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So will I,</q> said Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!</q> tittered
Maximov.
</p>

<pb n='477'/><anchor id='Pg477'/>

<p>
<q>All! All!</q> cried Mitya. <q>Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!</q>
</p>

<p>
The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put
on the table. Mitya filled the glasses.
</p>

<p>
<q>To Russia! Hurrah!</q> he shouted again. All drank the toast
except the Poles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once.
The Poles did not touch theirs.
</p>

<p>
<q>How's this, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>?</q>
cried Mitya, <q>won't you drink it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Pan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant
voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>To Russia as she was before 1772.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, that's better!</q> cried the other Pole, and they both
emptied their glasses at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're fools, you <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>,</q>
broke suddenly from Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie!</foreign></q>
shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya
like a couple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can one help loving one's own country?</q> he shouted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Be silent! Don't quarrel! I won't have any quarreling!</q> cried
Grushenka imperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her
face glowed, her eyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had
just drunk were apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panovie</foreign>, forgive me! It was my fault,
I'm sorry. Vrublevsky,
<foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign> Vrublevsky, I'm sorry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!</q> Grushenka
scolded with angry annoyance.
</p>

<p>
Every one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,</q> Mitya began again, unable
to make anything of Grushenka's words. <q>Come, why are we sitting
here? What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, it's certainly anything but amusing!</q> Kalganov mumbled
lazily.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's play faro again, as we did just now,</q> Maximov tittered
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Faro? Splendid!</q> cried Mitya. <q>If
only the <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's lite, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>,</q>
the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were
unwillingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true,</q> assented Pan Vrublevsky.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lite? What do you mean by <q>lite</q>?</q> asked Grushenka.
</p>

<pb n='478'/><anchor id='Pg478'/>

<p>
<q>Late, <foreign rend='italic'>pani</foreign>! <q>a late hour</q> I mean,</q>
 the Pole on the sofa explained.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's always late with them. They can never do anything!</q>
Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger. <q>They're dull themselves,
so they want others to be dull. Before you came, Mitya, they were
just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My goddess!</q> cried the Pole on the sofa, <q>I see you're not well-disposed
to me, that's why I'm gloomy. I'm ready, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
added he, addressing Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Begin, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket,
and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. <q>I want to lose
a lot to you. Take your cards. Make the bank.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll have cards from the landlord, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
said the little Pole, gravely and emphatically.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's much the best way,</q> chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.
</p>

<p>
<q>From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let's get them
from him. Cards!</q> Mitya shouted to the landlord.
</p>

<p>
The landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed
Mitya that the girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the
cymbals would most likely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions
had not yet arrived. Mitya jumped up from the table and
ran into the next room to give orders, but only three girls had
arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he did not know himself
what orders to give and why he had run out. He only told
them to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets,
the toffee and the fondants. <q>And vodka for Andrey, vodka for
Andrey!</q> he cried in haste. <q>I was rude to Andrey!</q>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on
the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me five roubles,</q> he whispered to Mitya. <q>I'll stake something
at faro, too, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!</q>
</p>

<p>
Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one
for ten roubles. <q>And if you lose that, come again, come again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very good,</q> Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again.
Mitya, too, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting.
The Poles had already sat down, and opened the pack. They
looked much more amiable, almost cordial. The Pole on the sofa
<pb n='479'/><anchor id='Pg479'/>
had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw. He wore an
air of solemnity.
</p>

<p>
<q>To your places, gentlemen,</q> cried Pan Vrublevsky.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I'm not going to play any more,</q> observed Kalganov, <q>I've
lost fifty roubles to them just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign> had no luck,
perhaps he'll be lucky this time,</q> the Pole
on the sofa observed in his direction.
</p>

<p>
<q>How much in the bank? To correspond?</q> asked Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's according, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,
maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred,
as much as you will stake.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A million!</q> laughed Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What Podvysotsky?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes
against it. Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes
against the bank. The banker says, <q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie</foreign>
Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, or must we trust to your honor?</q>
<q>To my honor, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
says Podvysotsky. <q>So much the better.</q> The
banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. <q>Take it,
<foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q> says
the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million.
<q>Take it, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>, this is your gain.</q>
There was a million in the bank. <q>I didn't know that,</q>
says Podvysotsky. <q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie</foreign> Podvysotsky,</q> said
the banker, <q>you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.</q> Podvysotsky
took the million.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true,</q> said Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie</foreign> Kalganov, in
gentlemanly society one doesn't say such
things.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!</q> cried Mitya,
but checked himself at once. <q>Forgive me, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,
it's my fault again, he would, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish
honor. You see how I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles,
the knave leads.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty
little <foreign rend='italic'>panienotchka</foreign>, he he!</q>
laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen,
and, as though trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right
up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The
rouble won, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>A corner!</q> cried Mitya.
</p>

<pb n='480'/><anchor id='Pg480'/>

<p>
<q>I'll bet another rouble, a <q>single</q> stake,</q> Maximov muttered
gleefully, hugely delighted at having won a rouble.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lost!</q> shouted Mitya. <q>A <q>double</q> on the seven!</q>
</p>

<p>
The seven too was trumped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop!</q> cried Kalganov suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Double! Double!</q> Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he
doubled the stake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles.
The rouble stakes kept winning.
</p>

<p>
<q>On the double!</q> shouted Mitya furiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've lost two hundred, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>.
Will you stake another hundred?</q>
the Pole on the sofa inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred!
All doubles!</q>
</p>

<p>
And pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to
fling two hundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it
with his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough!</q> he shouted in his ringing voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter?</q> Mitya stared at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough! I don't want you to play any more. Don't!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because I don't. Hang it, come away. That's why. I won't let
you go on playing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya gazed at him in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Give it up, Mitya. He may be right. You've lost a lot as it is,</q>
said Grushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles
rose from their seats with a deeply offended air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you joking, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?</q>
said the short man, looking severely
at Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>How dare you!</q> Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't dare to shout like that,</q> cried Grushenka. <q>Ah, you turkey-cocks!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka's
face suddenly struck him, and at the same instant something
new flashed into his mind&mdash;a strange new thought!
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign> Agrippina,</q>
the little Pole was beginning, crimson with
anger, when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on
the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most illustrious, two words with you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='481'/><anchor id='Pg481'/>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the next room, I've two words to say to you, something
pleasant, very pleasant. You'll be glad to hear it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The little <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign> was taken aback and looked
apprehensively at Mitya. He agreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky
went with them.
</p>

<p>
<q>The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must
have him!</q> cried Mitya. <q>March, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where are you going?</q> asked Grushenka, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll be back in one moment,</q> answered Mitya.
</p>

<p>
There was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his
eyes. His face had looked very different when he entered the room
an hour before.
</p>

<p>
He led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls
was assembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom
on the right, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there
were two large beds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each.
There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner. The
small man and Mitya sat down to this table, facing each other,
while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them, his hands behind his
back. The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive.
</p>

<p>
<q>What can I do for you, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?</q>
lisped the little Pole.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, look here, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,
I won't keep you long. There's money
for you,</q> he pulled out his notes. <q>Would you like three thousand?
Take it and go your way.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?</q> He exchanged glances with
Vrublevsky.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three, <foreign rend='italic'>panovie</foreign>, three!
Listen, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>, I see you're a sensible man.
Take three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you&mdash;d'you
hear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You
understand that, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,
for ever. Here's the door, you go out of it.
What have you got there, a great-coat, a fur coat? I'll bring it out
to you. They'll get the horses out directly, and then&mdash;good-by,
<foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An
expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole's face.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the money, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?</q>
</p>

<pb n='482'/><anchor id='Pg482'/>

<p>
<q>The money, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?
Five hundred roubles I'll give you this
moment for the journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand
five hundred to-morrow, in the town&mdash;I swear on my honor,
I'll get it, I'll get it at any cost!</q> cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
The Poles exchanged glances again. The short man's face looked
more forbidding.
</p>

<p>
<q>Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this
minute, cash down!</q> Mitya added, feeling something wrong.
<q>What's the matter, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?
Don't you trust me? I can't give you
the whole three thousand straight off. If I give it, you may come
back to her to-morrow.... Besides, I haven't the three thousand
with me. I've got it at home in the town,</q> faltered Mitya, his
spirit sinking at every word he uttered. <q>Upon my word, the
money's there, hidden.</q>
</p>

<p>
In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed
itself in the little man's face.
</p>

<p>
<q>What next?</q> he asked ironically. <q>For shame!</q> and he spat
on the floor. Pan Vrublevsky spat too.
</p>

<p>
<q>You do that, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
said Mitya, recognizing with despair that
all was over, <q>because you hope to make more out of Grushenka?
You're a couple of capons, that's what you are!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is a mortal insult!</q> The little Pole turned as red as a crab,
and he went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear
another word. Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed,
confused and crestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka,
afraid that the <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign>
would at once raise an outcry. And so indeed
he did. The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a
theatrical attitude before Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign> Agrippina,
I have received a mortal insult!</q> he exclaimed.
But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had
wounded her in the tenderest spot.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak Russian! Speak Russian!</q> she cried, <q>not another word
of Polish! You used to talk Russian. You can't have forgotten it
in five years.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was red with passion.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign> Agrippina&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My name's Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won't
listen!</q>
</p>

<pb n='483'/><anchor id='Pg483'/>

<p>
The Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously
delivered himself in broken Russian:
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign> Agrafena,
I came here to forget the past and forgive it,
to forget all that has happened till to-day&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive? Came here to forgive me?</q> Grushenka cut him short,
jumping up from her seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so, <foreign rend='italic'>pani</foreign>,
I'm not pusillanimous, I'm magnanimous. But I
was astounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three
thousand, in the other room to depart.
I spat in the <foreign rend='italic'>pan's</foreign> face.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What? He offered you money for me?</q> cried Grushenka,
hysterically. <q>Is it true, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie, panie!</foreign></q>
yelled Mitya, <q>she's pure and shining, and I have
never been her lover! That's a lie....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How dare you defend me to him?</q> shrieked Grushenka. <q>It
wasn't virtue kept me pure, and it wasn't that I was afraid of
Kuzma, but that I might hold up my head when I met him, and
tell him he's a scoundrel. And he did actually refuse the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He took it! He took it!</q> cried Mitya; <q>only he wanted to get
the whole three thousand at once, and I could only give him seven
hundred straight off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign> Agrippina!</q>
cried the little Pole. <q>I'm&mdash;a knight, I'm&mdash;a
nobleman, and not a <foreign rend='italic'>lajdak</foreign>.
I came here to make you my wife
and I find you a different woman, perverse and shameless.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, go back where you came from! I'll tell them to turn you
out and you'll be turned out,</q> cried Grushenka, furious. <q>I've been
a fool, a fool, to have been miserable these five years! And it
wasn't for his sake, it was my anger made me miserable. And this
isn't he at all! Was he like this? It might be his father! Where
did you get your wig from? He was a falcon, but this is a gander.
He used to laugh and sing to me.... And I've been crying for
five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I was!</q>
</p>

<p>
She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At
that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the
left&mdash;a rollicking dance song.
</p>

<p>
<q>A regular Sodom!</q> Vrublevsky roared suddenly. <q>Landlord,
send the shameless hussies away!</q>
</p>

<p>
The landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping
<pb n='484'/><anchor id='Pg484'/>
in at the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were
quarreling, at once entered the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you shouting for? D'you want to split your throat?</q>
he said, addressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Animal!</q> bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.
</p>

<p>
<q>Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just
now? I gave you a pack and you hid it. You played with marked
cards! I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards,
d'you know that, for it's just the same as false banknotes....</q>
</p>

<p>
And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa
back and the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here's my pack unopened!</q>
</p>

<p>
He held it up and showed it to all in the room. <q>From where I
stood I saw him slip my pack away, and put his in place of it&mdash;you're
a cheat and not a gentleman!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I twice saw the <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign>
change a card!</q> cried Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>How shameful! How shameful!</q> exclaimed Grushenka, clasping
her hands, and blushing for genuine shame. <q>Good Lord, he's
come to that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought so, too!</q> said Mitya. But before he had uttered the
words, Vrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his
fist at Grushenka, shouting:
</p>

<p>
<q>You low harlot!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him
in the air, and in one instant had carried him into the room on
the right, from which they had just come.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've laid him on the floor, there,</q> he announced, returning at
once, gasping with excitement. <q>He's struggling, the scoundrel!
But he won't come back, no fear of that!...</q>
</p>

<p>
He closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other
ajar called out to the little Pole:
</p>

<p>
<q>Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> said Trifon Borissovitch, <q>make
them give you back the money you lost. It's as good as stolen from
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want my fifty roubles back,</q> Kalganov declared suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want my two hundred, either,</q> cried Mitya, <q>I wouldn't
take it for anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.</q>
</p>

<pb n='485'/><anchor id='Pg485'/>

<p>
<q>Bravo, Mitya! You're a trump, Mitya!</q> cried Grushenka, and
there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation.
</p>

<p>
The little <foreign rend='italic'>pan</foreign>,
crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity,
was making for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly,
addressing Grushenka:
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign>,
if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-by.</q>
</p>

<p>
And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the
door. This was a man of character: he had so good an opinion of
himself that after all that had passed, he still expected that she
would marry him. Mitya slammed the door after him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lock it,</q> said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side,
they had locked it from within.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's capital!</q> exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. <q>Serve them
right!</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter VIII. Delirium</head>

<p>
What followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were
welcome. Grushenka was the first to call for wine.
</p>

<p>
<q>I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before.
Do you remember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends
here last time!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness was
at hand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from
her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, <q>let
the stove and cottage dance</q>; as we had it last time,</q> she kept exclaiming.
She was tremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to
obey her. The chorus were in the next room. The room in which
they had been sitting till that moment was too small, and was
divided in two by cotton curtains, behind which was a huge bed
with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows. In
the four rooms for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled
herself just at the door. Mitya set an easy chair for her. She had
sat in the same place to watch the dancing and singing <q>the time
before,</q> when they had made merry there. All the girls who had
<pb n='486'/><anchor id='Pg486'/>
come had been there then; the Jewish band with fiddles and zithers
had come, too, and at last the long expected cart had arrived with
the wines and provisions.
</p>

<p>
Mitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the
room to look on, peasants and their women, who had been roused
from sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment
such as they had enjoyed a month before. Mitya remembered
their faces, greeting and embracing every one he knew. He
uncorked bottles and poured out wine for every one who presented
himself. Only the girls were very eager for the champagne. The
men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. Mitya had
chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovars
should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone
to help himself.
</p>

<p>
An absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his
natural element, and the more foolish it became, the more his spirits
rose. If the peasants had asked him for money at that moment, he
would have pulled out his notes and given them away right and left.
This was probably why the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept
hovering about Mitya to protect him. He seemed to have given
up all idea of going to bed that night; but he drank little, only one
glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out on Mitya's interests after
his own fashion. He intervened in the nick of time, civilly and
obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away <q>cigars and Rhine
wine,</q> and, above all, money to the peasants as he had done before.
He was very indignant, too, at the peasant girls drinking liqueur,
and eating sweets.
</p>

<p>
<q>They're a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> he said. <q>I'd give
them a kick, every one of them, and they'd take it as an honor&mdash;that's
all they're worth!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent
out to him. <q>I was rude to him just now,</q> he repeated with a
sinking, softened voice. Kalganov did not want to drink, and at
first did not care for the girls' singing; but after he had drunk a
couple of glasses of champagne he became extraordinarily lively,
strolling about the room, laughing and praising the music and the
songs, admiring every one and everything. Maximov, blissfully
<pb n='487'/><anchor id='Pg487'/>
drunk, never left his side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to get
drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she said to Mitya:
</p>

<p>
<q>What a dear, charming boy he is!</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh,
great were his hopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed,
purposely to refrain from speaking. But she looked at him from
time to time with caressing and passionate eyes. At last she suddenly
gripped his hand and drew him vigorously to her. She was sitting
at the moment in the low chair by the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!...
I was frightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you?
Did you really want to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I didn't want to spoil your happiness!</q> Mitya faltered blissfully.
But she did not need his answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, go and enjoy yourself ...</q> she sent him away once more.
<q>Don't cry, I'll call you back again.</q>
</p>

<p>
He would run away, and she listened to the singing and looked
at the dancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went.
But in another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and
again he would run back to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and
my coming here yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently,
feverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and
stopping abruptly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you frowning at?</q> she asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing.... I left a man ill there. I'd give ten years of my
life for him to get well, to know he was all right!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, never mind him, if he's ill. So you meant to shoot yourself
to-morrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless
fellows as you,</q> she lisped, with a rather halting tongue. <q>So you
would go any length for me, eh? Did you really mean to shoot
yourself to-morrow, you stupid? No, wait a little. To-morrow I
may have something to say to you.... I won't say it to-day, but
to-morrow. You'd like it to be to-day? No, I don't want to to-day.
Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Once, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy.
</p>

<pb n='488'/><anchor id='Pg488'/>

<p>
<q>Why are you sad? I see you're sad.... Yes, I see it,</q> she
added, looking intently into his eyes. <q>Though you keep kissing the
peasants and shouting, I see something. No, be merry. I'm merry;
you be merry, too.... I love somebody here. Guess who it is.
Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep, poor dear, he's drunk.</q>
</p>

<p>
She meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped
asleep for a moment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely
drowsy from drink; he felt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, <q>bored.</q>
He was intensely depressed by the girls' songs, which, as the drinking
went on, gradually became coarse and more reckless. And the
dances were as bad. Two girls dressed up as bears, and a lively girl,
called Stepanida, with a stick in her hand, acted the part of keeper,
and began to <q>show them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Look alive, Marya, or you'll get the stick!</q>
</p>

<p>
The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly
fashion, amid roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of
men and women.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, let them! Let them!</q> said Grushenka sententiously, with
an ecstatic expression on her face. <q>When they do get a day to
enjoy themselves, why shouldn't folks be happy?</q>
</p>

<p>
Kalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's swinish, all this peasant foolery,</q> he murmured, moving
away; <q>it's the game they play when it's light all night in summer.</q>
</p>

<p>
He particularly disliked one <q>new</q> song to a jaunty dance-tune.
It described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls,
to see whether they would love him:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The master came to try the girls:</l>
<l>Would they love him, would they not?</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But the girls could not love the master:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>He would beat me cruelly</l>
<l>And such love won't do for me.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
Then a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The gypsy came to try the girls:</l>
<l>Would they love him, would they not?</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But they couldn't love the gypsy either:
</p>

<pb n='489'/><anchor id='Pg489'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>He would be a thief, I fear,</l>
<l>And would cause me many a tear.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
And many more men come to try their luck, among them a
soldier:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The soldier came to try the girls:</l>
<l>Would they love him, would they not?</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines,
sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience.
The song ends with a merchant:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The merchant came to try the girls:</l>
<l>Would they love him, would they not?</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
And it appears that he wins their love because:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The merchant will make gold for me</l>
<l>And his queen I'll gladly be.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
Kalvanov was positively indignant.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just a song of yesterday,</q> he said aloud. <q>Who writes
such things for them? They might just as well have had a railwayman
or a Jew come to try his luck with the girls; they'd have
carried all before them.</q>
</p>

<p>
And, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared, on
the spot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately
fell asleep. His pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back
on the sofa cushion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Look how pretty he is,</q> said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to
him. <q>I was combing his hair just now; his hair's like flax, and so
thick....</q>
</p>

<p>
And, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead. Kalganov
instantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and with
the most anxious air inquired where was Maximov?
</p>

<p>
<q>So that's who it is you want.</q> Grushenka laughed. <q>Stay with
me a minute. Mitya, run and find his Maximov.</q>
</p>

<p>
Maximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the
girls, only running away from time to time to pour himself out a
glass of liqueur. He had drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was
red, and his nose was crimson; his eyes were moist and mawkishly
<pb n='490'/><anchor id='Pg490'/>
sweet. He ran up and announced that he was going to dance the
<q>sabotière.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I
was little....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go, go with him, Mitya, and I'll watch from here how he
dances,</q> said Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, I'm coming to look on, too,</q> exclaimed Kalganov, brushing
aside in the most naïve way Grushenka's offer to sit with him.
They all went to look on. Maximov danced his dance. But it
roused no great admiration in any one but Mitya. It consisted of
nothing but skipping and hopping, kicking up the feet, and at every
skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole of his foot. Kalganov
did not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks. You're tired perhaps? What are you looking for here?
Would you like some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A cigarette.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't you want a drink?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there's a heap of them on the table there. Choose one, my
dear soul!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I like one with vanilla ... for old people. He he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, brother, we've none of that special sort.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say,</q> the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya's ear. <q>That
girl there, little Marya, he he! How would it be if you were to
help me make friends with her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So that's what you're after! No, brother, that won't do!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'd do no harm to any one,</q> Maximov muttered disconsolately.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing,
you know, brother. But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink
and be merry, meanwhile. Don't you want money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Later on, perhaps,</q> smiled Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya's head was burning. He went outside to the wooden
balcony which ran round the whole building on the inner side, overlooking
the courtyard. The fresh air revived him. He stood alone
in a dark corner, and suddenly clutched his head in both hands. His
scattered thoughts came together; his sensations blended into a whole
and threw a sudden light into his mind. A fearful and terrible
<pb n='491'/><anchor id='Pg491'/>
light! <q>If I'm to shoot myself, why not now?</q> passed through his
mind. <q>Why not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here, in
this dark dirty corner, make an end?</q> Almost a minute he stood,
undecided. A few hours earlier, when he had been dashing here, he
was pursued by disgrace, by the theft he had committed, and that
blood, that blood!... But yet it was easier for him then. Then
everything was over: he had lost her, given her up. She was gone,
for him&mdash;oh, then his death sentence had been easier for him; at least
it had seemed necessary, inevitable, for what had he to stay on
earth for?
</p>

<p>
But now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one
terror at least was at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful
figure had vanished, leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had
turned into something so small, so comic; it had been carried into
the bedroom and locked in. It would never return. She was
ashamed, and from her eyes he could see now whom she loved.
Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not
go on living, he could not; oh, damnation! <q>O God! restore to life
the man I knocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass
from me! Lord, thou hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me!
But what, what if the old man's alive? Oh, then the shame of the
other disgrace I would wipe away. I would restore the stolen money.
I'd give it back; I'd get it somehow.... No trace of that shame
will remain except in my heart for ever! But no, no; oh, impossible
cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation!</q>
</p>

<p>
Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He
jumped up and ran back to the room&mdash;to her, to her, his queen for
ever! Was not one moment of her love worth all the rest of life,
even in the agonies of disgrace? This wild question clutched at his
heart. <q>To her, to her alone, to see her, to hear her, to think of
nothing, to forget everything, if only for that night, for an hour,
for a moment!</q> Just as he turned from the balcony into the passage,
he came upon the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch. He thought
he looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he had come to find him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir.</q> The landlord seemed disconcerted. <q>Why should I
be looking for you? Where have you been?</q>
</p>

<pb n='492'/><anchor id='Pg492'/>

<p>
<q>Why do you look so glum? You're not angry, are you? Wait
a bit, you shall soon get to bed.... What's the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It'll be three o'clock. Past three, it must be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll leave off soon. We'll leave off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't mention it; it doesn't matter. Keep it up as long as you
like....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with him?</q> Mitya wondered for an instant,
and he ran back to the room where the girls were dancing. But she
was not there. She was not in the blue room either; there was no
one but Kalganov asleep on the sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain&mdash;she
was there. She was sitting in the corner, on a trunk.
Bent forward, with her head and arms on the bed close by, she was
crying bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobs that she might not
be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, and when he ran
to her, she grasped his hand tightly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him
these five years, all that time! Did I love him or only my own
anger? No, him, him! It's a lie that it was my anger I loved and
not him. Mitya, I was only seventeen then; he was so kind to me,
so merry; he used to sing to me.... Or so it seemed to a silly
girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it's not the same man. Even
his face is not the same; he's different altogether. I shouldn't have
known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was
thinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we
should look at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden
it was just as though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me.
He talked to me like a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he
met me so solemnly that I was struck dumb. I couldn't get a word
in. At first I thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big
Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering why I couldn't say a
word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruined him;
you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed
him like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I'm ashamed,
I'm ashamed for all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five
years!</q>
</p>

<p>
And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya's hand
and did not let it go.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, darling, stay, don't go away. I want to say one word
<pb n='493'/><anchor id='Pg493'/>
to you,</q> she whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. <q>Listen,
tell me who it is I love? I love one man here. Who is that man?
That's what you must tell me.</q>
</p>

<p>
A smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and
her eyes shone in the half darkness.
</p>

<p>
<q>A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. <q>Fool! that's the man
you love!</q> That was what my heart whispered to me at once. You
came in and all grew bright. What's he afraid of? I wondered.
For you were frightened; you couldn't speak. It's not them he's
afraid of&mdash;could you be frightened of any one? It's me he's afraid
of, I thought, only me. So Fenya told you, you little stupid, how
I called to Alyosha out of the window that I'd loved Mityenka for
one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another. Mitya,
Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any one
after you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not?
Do you love me? Do you love me?</q> She jumped up and held him
with both hands on his shoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture,
gazed into her eyes, at her face, at her smile, and suddenly clasped
her tightly in his arms and kissed her passionately.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through
spite I tormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out
of his mind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house
one day and broke the wine-glass? I remembered that and I broke
a glass to-day and drank <q>to my vile heart.</q> Mitya, my falcon, why
don't you kiss me? He kissed me once, and now he draws back
and looks and listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me, kiss me hard,
that's right. If you love, well, then, love! I'll be your slave now,
your slave for the rest of my life. It's sweet to be a slave. Kiss
me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I
do deserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won't have that....</q>
she suddenly thrust him away. <q>Go along, Mitya, I'll come and have
some wine, I want to be drunk, I'm going to get drunk and dance;
I must, I must!</q> She tore herself away from him and disappeared
behind the curtain. Mitya followed like a drunken man.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, come what may&mdash;whatever may happen now, for one minute
I'd give the whole world,</q> he thought. Grushenka did, in fact,
toss off a whole glass of champagne at one gulp, and became at once
very tipsy. She sat down in the same chair as before, with a blissful
<pb n='494'/><anchor id='Pg494'/>
smile on her face. Her cheeks were glowing, her lips were burning,
her flashing eyes were moist; there was passionate appeal in her eyes.
Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heart and went up to her.
</p>
