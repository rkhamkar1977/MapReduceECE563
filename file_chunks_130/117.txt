the lighted windows of the house too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She's there!</q> and he
leapt from the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory
was ill and very likely Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one
to hear him, he instinctively hid himself, stood still, and began to
<pb n='437'/><anchor id='Pg437'/>
listen. But there was dead silence on all sides and, as though of
design, complete stillness, not the slightest breath of wind.
</p>

<p>
<q>And naught but the whispering silence,</q> the line for some reason
rose to his mind. <q>If only no one heard me jump over the fence!
I think not.</q> Standing still for a minute, he walked softly over the
grass in the garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked
slowly, creeping stealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps.
It took him five minutes to reach the lighted window. He
remembered that just under the window there were several thick
and high bushes of elder and whitebeam. The door from the house
into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut; he had carefully
looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached the bushes
and hid behind them. He held his breath. <q>I must wait now,</q> he
thought, <q>to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are
listening ... if only I don't cough or sneeze.</q>
</p>

<p>
He waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at
moments, he could scarcely breathe. <q>No, this throbbing at my
heart won't stop,</q> he thought. <q>I can't wait any longer.</q> He was
standing behind a bush in the shadow. The light of the window fell
on the front part of the bush.
</p>

<p>
<q>How red the whitebeam berries are!</q> he murmured, not knowing
why. Softly and noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window,
and raised himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch's bedroom
lay open before him. It was not a large room, and was divided in
two parts by a red screen, <q>Chinese,</q> as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to
call it. The word <q>Chinese</q> flashed into Mitya's mind, <q>and behind
the screen, is Grushenka,</q> thought Mitya. He began watching
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his new striped-silk dressing-gown,
which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cord with tassels
round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen with gold
studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown. On his
head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha
had seen.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has got himself up,</q> thought Mitya.
</p>

<p>
His father was standing near the window, apparently lost in
thought. Suddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and
hearing nothing went up to the table, poured out half a glass of
brandy from a decanter and drank it off. Then he uttered a deep
<pb n='438'/><anchor id='Pg438'/>
sigh, again stood still a moment, walked carelessly up to the looking-glass
on the wall, with his right hand raised the red bandage on his
forehead a little, and began examining his bruises and scars, which
had not yet disappeared.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's alone,</q> thought Mitya, <q>in all probability he's alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned
suddenly to the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped
away into the shadow.
</p>

<p>
<q>She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she's asleep by
now,</q> he thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch
moved away from the window. <q>He's looking for her out of the
window, so she's not there. Why should he stare out into the dark?
He's wild with impatience.</q> ... Mitya slipped back at once, and
fell to gazing in at the window again. The old man was sitting
down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he put his
elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya
watched him eagerly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's alone, he's alone!</q> he repeated again. <q>If she were here,
his face would be different.</q>
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart
that she was not here. <q>It's not that she's not here,</q> he explained
to himself, immediately, <q>but that I can't tell for certain whether
she is or not.</q> Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at
that moment exceptionally clear, that he took in everything to the
slightest detail, and missed no point. But a feeling of misery, the
misery of uncertainty and indecision, was growing in his heart with
every instant. <q>Is she here or not?</q> The angry doubt filled his
heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out his hand and
softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal the
old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then
three times more quickly, the signal that meant <q>Grushenka is
here!</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly,
ran to the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor
Pavlovitch opened the window and thrust his whole head out.
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?</q> he said, in a sort of trembling
half-whisper. <q>Where are you, my angel, where are you?</q> He
was fearfully agitated and breathless.
</p>

<pb n='439'/><anchor id='Pg439'/>

<p>
<q>He's alone.</q> Mitya decided.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where are you?</q> cried the old man again; and he thrust his
head out farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions,
right and left. <q>Come here, I've a little present for you.
Come, I'll show you....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He means the three thousand,</q> thought Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>But where are you? Are you at the door? I'll open it directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out
to the right, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see
into the darkness. In another second he would certainly have run
out to open the door without waiting for Grushenka's answer.
</p>

<p>
Mitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old
man's profile that he loathed so, his pendent Adam's apple, his hooked
nose, his lips that smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly
lighted up by the slanting lamplight falling on the left from the
room. A horrible fury of hatred suddenly surged up in Mitya's
heart: <q>There he was, his rival, the man who had tormented him,
had ruined his life!</q> It was a rush of that sudden, furious, revengeful
anger of which he had spoken, as though foreseeing it, to
Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer to Alyosha's
question, <q>How can you say you'll kill our father?</q> <q>I don't know,
I don't know,</q> he had said then. <q>Perhaps I shall not kill him, perhaps
I shall. I'm afraid he'll suddenly be so loathsome to me at
that moment. I hate his double chin, his nose, his eyes, his shameless
grin. I feel a personal repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of,
that's what may be too much for me.</q> ... This personal repulsion
was growing unendurable. Mitya was beside himself, he suddenly
pulled the brass pestle out of his pocket.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
<q>God was watching over me then,</q> Mitya himself said afterwards.
At that very moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness.
Earlier in the evening he had undergone the treatment which
Smerdyakov had described to Ivan. He had rubbed himself all over
with vodka mixed with a secret, very strong decoction, had drunk
what was left of the mixture while his wife repeated a <q>certain
prayer</q> over him, after which he had gone to bed. Marfa Ignatyevna
had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong drink,
slept like the dead beside her husband.
</p>

<pb n='440'/><anchor id='Pg440'/>

<p>
But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a
moment's reflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his
back, he sat up in bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and
dressed hurriedly. Perhaps his conscience was uneasy at the thought
of sleeping while the house was unguarded <q>in such perilous times.</q>
Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, lay motionless in the next room.
Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. <q>The stuff's been too much for
the woman,</q> Grigory thought, glancing at her, and groaning, he
went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out from
the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and
his right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that
he had not locked the little gate into the garden that evening. He
was the most punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an
unchangeable routine, and habits that lasted for years. Limping and
writhing with pain he went down the steps and towards the garden.
Yes, the gate stood wide open. Mechanically he stepped into the
garden. Perhaps he fancied something, perhaps caught some sound,
and, glancing to the left he saw his master's window open. No one
was looking out of it then.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's it open for? It's not summer now,</q> thought Grigory,
and suddenly, at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something
extraordinary before him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him
a man seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving
very fast.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Lord!</q> cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the
pain in his back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He
took a short cut, evidently he knew the garden better; the flying
figure went towards the bath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the
garden fence. Grigory followed, not losing sight of him, and ran,
forgetting everything. He reached the fence at the very moment
the man was climbing over it. Grigory cried out, beside himself,
pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two hands.
</p>

<p>
Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him,
it was he, the <q>monster,</q> the <q>parricide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Parricide!</q> the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood
could hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as
though struck by lightning.
</p>

<p>
Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man.
<pb n='441'/><anchor id='Pg441'/>
In Mitya's hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in
the grass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass
but on the path, in a most conspicuous place. For some seconds he
examined the prostrate figure before him. The old man's head was
covered with blood. Mitya put out his hand and began feeling it.
He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had been awfully anxious
to make sure whether he had broken the old man's skull, or simply
stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing horribly;
and in a moment Mitya's fingers were drenched with the hot stream.
He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white handkerchief
with which he had provided himself for his visit to Madame
Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man's head, senselessly trying
to wipe the blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief
was instantly soaked with blood.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens! what am I doing it for?</q> thought Mitya, suddenly
pulling himself together. <q>If I have broken his skull, how
can I find out now? And what difference does it make now?</q> he
added, hopelessly. <q>If I've killed him, I've killed him.... You've
come to grief, old man, so there you must lie!</q> he said aloud. And
suddenly turning to the fence, he vaulted over it into the lane and
fell to running&mdash;the handkerchief soaked with blood he held,
crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the back
pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who
met him in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they
had met a man running that night. He flew back again to the
widow Morozov's house.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed
to the chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christ's
sake, <q>not to let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.</q> Nazar
Ivanovitch promised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had
suddenly sent for him, and meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty,
who had recently come from the country, on the way up told him
to take his place, but forgot to mention <q>the captain.</q> Mitya,
running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly recognized
him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening the gate
at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a good-humored
smile that <q>Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now,
you know.</q>
</p>

<pb n='442'/><anchor id='Pg442'/>

<p>
<q>Where is she then, Prohor?</q> asked Mitya, stopping short.
</p>

<p>
<q>She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to
Mokroe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What for?</q> cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I can't say. To see some officer. Some one invited her
and horses were sent to fetch her.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter V. A Sudden Resolution</head>

<p>
She was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were
both just going to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had
not locked themselves in. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and
seized her by the throat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at
Mokroe?</q> he roared furiously.
</p>

<p>
Both the women squealed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! I'll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I'll
tell you everything directly, I won't hide anything,</q> gabbled Fenya,
frightened to death; <q>she's gone to Mokroe, to her officer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What officer?</q> roared Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who
threw her over five years ago,</q> cackled Fenya, as fast as she could
speak.
</p>

<p>
Mitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her
throat. He stood facing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word,
but his eyes showed that he realized it all, all, from the first word,
and guessed the whole position. Poor Fenya was not in a condition
at that moment to observe whether he understood or not. She
remained sitting on the trunk as she had been when he ran into the
room, trembling all over, holding her hands out before her as though
trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grown rigid in that
position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably upon
him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared
with blood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead
<pb n='443'/><anchor id='Pg443'/>
with them, wiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead
and his right cheek were blood-stained patches. Fenya was on the
verge of hysterics. The old cook had jumped up and was staring
at him like a mad woman, almost unconscious with terror.
</p>

<p>
Mitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair
next to Fenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror-stricken,
benumbed. Yet everything was clear as day: that officer,
he knew about him, he knew everything perfectly, he had known
it from Grushenka herself, had known that a letter had come from
him a month before. So that for a month, for a whole month, this
had been going on, a secret from him, till the very arrival of this
new man, and he had never thought of him! But how could he,
how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten
this officer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of
him? That was the question that faced him like some monstrous
thing. And he looked at this monstrous thing with horror, growing
cold with horror.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate
child, he began speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly forgotten
how he had scared and hurt her just now. He fell to questioning
Fenya with an extreme preciseness, astonishing in his position, and
though the girl looked wildly at his blood-stained hands, she, too,
with wonderful readiness and rapidity, answered every question as
though eager to put the whole truth and nothing but the truth
before him. Little by little, even with a sort of enjoyment, she
began explaining every detail, not wanting to torment him, but, as
it were, eager to be of the utmost service to him. She described
the whole of that day, in great detail, the visit of Rakitin and
Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the watch, how the mistress
had set off, and how she had called out of the window to Alyosha
to give him, Mitya, her greetings, and to tell him <q>to remember
for ever how she had loved him for an hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
Hearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was
a flush of color on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said
to him, not a bit afraid now to be inquisitive:
</p>

<p>
<q>Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They're all over
blood!</q>
</p>

<pb n='444'/><anchor id='Pg444'/>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at
his hands and at once forgot them and Fenya's question.
</p>

<p>
He sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since
he had run in. His first horror was over, but evidently some new
fixed determination had taken possession of him. He suddenly stood
up, smiling dreamily.
</p>

<p>
<q>What has happened to you, sir?</q> said Fenya, pointing to his
hands again. She spoke compassionately, as though she felt very
near to him now in his grief. Mitya looked at his hands again.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's blood, Fenya,</q> he said, looking at her with a strange expression.
<q>That's human blood, and my God! why was it shed?
But ... Fenya ... there's a fence here</q> (he looked at her as
though setting her a riddle), <q>a high fence, and terrible to look at.
But at dawn to-morrow, when the sun rises, Mitya will leap over
that fence.... You don't understand what fence, Fenya, and,
never mind.... You'll hear to-morrow and understand ... and
now, good-by. I won't stand in her way. I'll step aside, I know
how to step aside. Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour,
remember Mityenka Karamazov so for ever.... She always used
to call me Mityenka, do you remember?</q>
</p>

<p>
And with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen.
Fenya was almost more frightened at this sudden departure than she
had been when he ran in and attacked her.
</p>

<p>
Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin,
the young official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was
by now half-past eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening
tea, and had just put his coat on again to go to the <q>Metropolis</q> to
play billiards. Mitya caught him coming out.
</p>

<p>
Seeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man
uttered a cry of surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens! What is the matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've come for my pistols,</q> said Mitya, <q>and brought you the
money. And thanks very much. I'm in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch,
please make haste.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught
sight of a bundle of bank-notes in Mitya's hand, and what was more,
he had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one
carries money: he had them in his right hand, and held them outstretched
<pb n='445'/><anchor id='Pg445'/>
as if to show them. Perhotin's servant-boy, who met
Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that he walked into the passage
in the same way, with the money outstretched in his hand, so
he must have been carrying them like that even in the streets. They
were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes, and the fingers holding
them were covered with blood.
</p>

<p>
When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of
money, he said that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it
might have been two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big,
<q>fat</q> bundle. <q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> so he testified afterwards,
<q>seemed unlike himself, too; not drunk, but, as it were, exalted,
lost to everything, but at the same time, as it were, absorbed, as
though pondering and searching for something and unable to come
to a decision. He was in great haste, answered abruptly and very
strangely, and at moments seemed not at all dejected but quite
cheerful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what <emph>is</emph> the matter with you? What's wrong?</q> cried Pyotr
Ilyitch, looking wildly at his guest. <q>How is it that you're all
covered with blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!</q>
</p>

<p>
He took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.
</p>

<p>
Seeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation! That's the last straw,</q> he muttered angrily, hurriedly
changing the notes from his right hand to the left, and impulsively
jerked the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the handkerchief
turned out to be soaked with blood, too (it was the handkerchief
he had used to wipe Grigory's face). There was scarcely
a white spot on it, and it had not merely begun to dry, but had
stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not be pulled apart. Mitya
threw it angrily on the floor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, damn it!</q> he said. <q>Haven't you a rag of some sort ...
to wipe my face?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you're only stained, not wounded? You'd better wash,</q> said
Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>Here's a wash-stand. I'll pour you out some
water.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A wash-stand? That's all right ... but where am I to put
this?</q>
</p>

<p>
With the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred-rouble
<pb n='446'/><anchor id='Pg446'/>
notes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were
for him to decide what he, Mitya, was to do with his own money.
</p>

<p>
<q>In your pocket, or on the table here. They won't be lost.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I
say, that's all nonsense,</q> he cried, as though suddenly coming out of
his absorption. <q>Look here, let's first settle that business of the
pistols. Give them back to me. Here's your money ... because I
am in great need of them ... and I haven't a minute, a minute
to spare.</q>
</p>

<p>
And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to
Pyotr Ilyitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I shan't have change enough. Haven't you less?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not
trusting his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost
ones.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, they're all alike,</q> he added, and again he looked inquiringly
at Pyotr Ilyitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>How have you grown so rich?</q> the latter asked. <q>Wait, I'll
send my boy to Plotnikov's, they close late&mdash;to see if they won't
change it. Here, Misha!</q> he called into the passage.
</p>

<p>
<q>To Plotnikov's shop&mdash;first-rate!</q> cried Mitya, as though struck
by an idea. <q>Misha,</q> he turned to the boy as he came in, <q>look
here, run to Plotnikov's and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
sends his greetings, and will be there directly.... But listen, listen,
tell them to have champagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I
come, and packed as it was to take to Mokroe. I took four dozen
with me then,</q> he added (suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch); <q>they
know all about it, don't you trouble, Misha,</q> he turned again to
the boy. <q>Stay, listen; tell them to put in cheese, Strasburg pies,
smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything, everything they've got,
up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twenty as before....
But wait: don't let them forget dessert, sweets, pears, water-melons,
two or three or four&mdash;no, one melon's enough, and chocolate, candy,
toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to Mokroe before, three
hundred roubles' worth with the champagne ... let it be just the
same again. And remember, Misha, if you are called Misha&mdash;His
name is Misha, isn't it?</q> He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a minute,</q> Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching
<pb n='447'/><anchor id='Pg447'/>
him uneasily, <q>you'd better go yourself and tell them. He'll muddle
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss
you for the commission.... If you don't make a mistake, there's
ten roubles for you, run along, make haste.... Champagne's the
chief thing, let them bring up champagne. And brandy, too, and
red and white wine, and all I had then.... They know what I
had then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But listen!</q> Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience.
<q>I say, let him simply run and change the money and tell them not
to close, and you go and tell them.... Give him your note. Be
off, Misha! Put your best leg forward!</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the
boy remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparently
understanding little of Mitya's orders, gazing up with amazement
and terror at his blood-stained face and the trembling bloodstained
fingers that held the notes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now come and wash,</q> said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. <q>Put
the money on the table or else in your pocket.... That's right,
come along. But take off your coat.</q>
</p>

<p>
And beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out again:
</p>

<p>
<q>Look, your coat's covered with blood, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That ... it's not the coat. It's only a little here on the sleeve....
And that's only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have
soaked through. I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya's,
and the blood's come through,</q> Mitya explained at once with a
childlike unconsciousness that was astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch listened,
frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been
fighting with some one,</q> he muttered.
</p>

<p>
They began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out
the water. Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands
(they were trembling, and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards).
But the young official insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and
rubbing them more. He seemed to exercise more and more sway
over Mitya, as time went on. It may be noted in passing that he
was a young man of sturdy character.
</p>

<p>
<q>Look, you haven't got your nails clean. Now rub your face;
<pb n='448'/><anchor id='Pg448'/>
here, on your temples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt?
Where are you going? Look, all the cuff of your right sleeve is
covered with blood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it's all bloody,</q> observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his
shirt.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then change your shirt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't time. You see I'll ...</q> Mitya went on with the
same confiding ingenuousness, drying his face and hands on the
towel, and putting on his coat. <q>I'll turn it up at the wrist. It
won't be seen under the coat.... You see!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been
fighting with some one? In the tavern again, as before? Have you
been beating that captain again?</q> Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully.
<q>Whom have you been beating now ... or killing, perhaps?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q> said Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why <q>nonsense</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't worry,</q> said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. <q>I smashed
an old woman in the market-place just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Smashed? An old woman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An old man!</q> cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the
face, laughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you
killed some one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We made it up. We had a row&mdash;and made it up. In a place I
know of. We parted friends. A fool.... He's forgiven me....
He's sure to have forgiven me by now ... if he had got up, he
wouldn't have forgiven me</q>&mdash;Mitya suddenly winked&mdash;<q>only damn
him, you know, I say, Pyotr Ilyitch, damn him! Don't worry about
him! I don't want to just now!</q> Mitya snapped out, resolutely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one
for? ... Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense....
You've been fighting and now you're rushing off on the spree&mdash;that's
you all over! Three dozen champagne&mdash;what do you want
all that for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor I've no
time now. I should like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but
I haven't the time. And there's no need, it's too late for talking.
<pb n='449'/><anchor id='Pg449'/>
Where's my money? Where have I put it?</q> he cried, thrusting his
hands into his pockets.
</p>

<p>
<q>You put it on the table ... yourself.... Here it is. Had
you forgotten? Money's like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here
are your pistols. It's an odd thing, at six o'clock you pledged them
for ten roubles, and now you've got thousands. Two or three I
should say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three, you bet,</q> laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the side-pocket
of his trousers.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll lose it like that. Have you found a gold-mine?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The mines? The gold-mines?</q> Mitya shouted at the top of his
voice and went off into a roar of laughter. <q>Would you like to go
to the mines, Perhotin? There's a lady here who'll stump up three
thousand for you, if only you'll go. She did it for me, she's so
awfully fond of gold-mines. Do you know Madame Hohlakov?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know her, but I've heard of her and seen her. Did she
really give you three thousand? Did she really?</q> said Pyotr Ilyitch,
eyeing him dubiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>As soon as the sun rises to-morrow, as soon as Phœbus, ever
young, flies upwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her, this
Madame Hohlakov, and ask her whether she did stump up that
three thousand or not. Try and find out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know on what terms you are ... since you say it so
positively, I suppose she did give it to you. You've got the money
in your hand, but instead of going to Siberia you're spending it all....
Where are you really off to now, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Mokroe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Mokroe? But it's night!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Once the lad had all, now the lad has naught,</q> cried Mitya
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How <q>naught</q>? You say that with all those thousands!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I'm not talking about thousands. Damn thousands! I'm talking
of the female character.</q>

<p>
<q>Am I drunk?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not drunk, but worse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm drunk in spirit, Pyotr Ilyitch, drunk in spirit! But that's
enough!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you doing, loading the pistol?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm loading the pistol.</q>
</p>

<p>
Unfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder
horn, and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then
he took the bullet and, before inserting it, held it in two fingers in
front of the candle.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you looking at the bullet?</q> asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching
him with uneasy curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your
brain, would you look at it or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why look at it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's going into my brain, so it's interesting to look and see what
it's like. But that's foolishness, a moment's foolishness. Now
that's done,</q> he added, putting in the bullet and driving it home
with the ramrod. <q>Pyotr Ilyitch, my dear fellow, that's nonsense,
all nonsense, and if only you knew what nonsense! Give me a little
piece of paper now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here's some paper.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, a clean new piece, writing-paper. That's right.</q>
</p>

<p>
And taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two
lines, folded the paper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket.
He put the pistols in the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand.
Then he looked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, let's go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where are we going? No, wait a minute.... Are you thinking
of putting that bullet in your brain, perhaps?</q> Pyotr Ilyitch
asked uneasily.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was fooling about the bullet! I want to live. I love life! You
may be sure of that. I love golden-haired Phœbus and his warm
light.... Dear Pyotr Ilyitch, do you know how to step aside?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>stepping aside</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Making way. Making way for a dear creature, and for one I
hate. And to let the one I hate become dear&mdash;that's what making
<pb n='451'/><anchor id='Pg451'/>
way means! And to say to them: God bless you, go your way, pass
on, while I&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>While you&mdash;?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough, let's go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word. I'll tell some one to prevent your going there,</q>
said Pyotr Ilyitch, looking at him. <q>What are you going to Mokroe
for, now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's a woman there, a woman. That's enough for you. You
shut up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, though you're such a savage I've always liked you....
I feel anxious.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, old fellow. I'm a savage you say. Savages, savages!
That's what I am always saying. Savages! Why, here's Misha! I
was forgetting him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Misha ran in, post-haste, with a handful of notes in change, and
reported that every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs'; <q>They're
carrying down the bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be
ready directly.</q> Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr
Ilyitch, then tossed another ten-rouble note to Misha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't dare to do such a thing!</q> cried Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>I won't
have it in my house, it's a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money
away. Here, put it here, why waste it? It would come in handy
to-morrow, and I dare say you'll be coming to me to borrow ten
roubles again. Why do you keep putting the notes in your side-pocket?
Ah, you'll lose them!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say, my dear fellow, let's go to Mokroe together.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I go for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say, let's open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want to
drink, and especially to drink with you. I've never drunk with you,
have I?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, we can go to the <q>Metropolis.</q> I was just going
there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't time for that. Let's drink at the Plotnikovs', in the
back room. Shall I ask you a riddle?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ask away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket, unfolded
it and showed it. In a large, distinct hand was written: <q>I
punish myself for my whole life, my whole life I punish!</q>
</p>

<pb n='452'/><anchor id='Pg452'/>

<p>
<q>I will certainly speak to some one, I'll go at once,</q> said Pyotr
Ilyitch, after reading the paper.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't have time, dear boy, come and have a drink. March!</q>
</p>

<p>
Plotnikov's shop was at the corner of the street, next door but
one to Pyotr Ilyitch's. It was the largest grocery shop in our
town, and by no means a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants.
They kept everything that could be got in a Petersburg
shop, grocery of all sort, wines <q>bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,</q>
fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar, and so on. There were three shop-assistants
and two errand boys always employed. Though our part
of the country had grown poorer, the landowners had gone away,
and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished as before,
every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of purchasers
for their goods.
</p>

<p>
They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They
had vivid recollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks
ago, wine and goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred
roubles, paid for in cash (they would never have let him have anything
on credit, of course). They remembered that then, as now,
he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand, and had
scattered them at random, without bargaining, without reflecting,
or caring to reflect what use so much wine and provisions would be
to him. The story was told all over the town that, driving off then
with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had <q>spent three thousand in one
night and the following day, and had come back from the spree
without a penny.</q> He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies (encamped
in our neighborhood at the time), who for two days got
money without stint out of him while he was drunk, and drank
expensive wine without stint. People used to tell, laughing at
Mitya, how he had given champagne to grimy-handed peasants,
and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and Strasburg
pies. Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a risky
proceeding, there was much laughter behind his back, especially in
the tavern, at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got
out of Grushenka by this <q>escapade</q> was <q>permission to kiss her
foot, and that was the utmost she had allowed him.</q>
</p>

<p>
By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they
found a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and
<pb n='453'/><anchor id='Pg453'/>
with Andrey, the driver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance.
In the shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of
provisions, and were only waiting for Mitya's arrival to nail it down
and put it in the cart. Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?</q> he asked Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight here
to the shop. There's no time to lose. Last time I drove with
Timofey, but Timofey now has gone on before me with the witch.
Shall we be very late, Andrey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They'll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that
maybe. I got Timofey ready to start. I know how he'll go. Their
pace won't be ours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They
won't get there an hour earlier!</q> Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged
driver, wearing a full-skirted coat, and with a kaftan on
his arm, replied warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fifty roubles for vodka if we're only an hour behind them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won't be
half an hour before us, let alone an hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his orders
strangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He began
a sentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found himself
obliged to come to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
<q>Four hundred roubles' worth, not less than four hundred roubles'
worth, just as it was then,</q> commanded Mitya. <q>Four dozen
champagne, not a bottle less.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want with so much? What's it for? Stay!</q> cried
Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>What's this box? What's in it? Surely there isn't
four hundred roubles' worth here?</q>
</p>

<p>
The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that
the first box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and
only <q>the most indispensable articles,</q> such as savories, sweets, toffee,
etc. But the main part of the goods ordered would be packed
and sent off, as on the previous occasion, in a special cart also with
three horses traveling at full speed, so that it would arrive not more
than an hour later than Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in
more toffee and fondants. The girls there are so fond of it,</q> Mitya
insisted hotly.
</p>

<pb n='454'/><anchor id='Pg454'/>

<p>
<q>The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four
dozen of champagne? One would be enough,</q> said Pyotr Ilyitch,
almost angry. He began bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods,
and refused to be satisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a hundred
roubles. In the end it was agreed that only three hundred
roubles' worth should be sent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you may go to the devil!</q> cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second
thoughts. <q>What's it to do with me? Throw away your money,
since it's cost you nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This way, my economist, this way, don't be angry.</q> Mitya
drew him into a room at the back of the shop. <q>They'll give us a
bottle here directly. We'll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along
with me, for you're a nice fellow, the sort I like.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered
with a dirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and
the champagne soon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the
gentlemen. <q>First-class oysters, the last lot in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hang the oysters. I don't eat them. And we don't need anything,</q>
cried Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no time for oysters,</q> said Mitya. <q>And I'm not hungry.
Do you know, friend,</q> he said suddenly, with feeling, <q>I never
have liked all this disorder.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon
my word, that's enough to make any one angry!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not what I mean. I'm talking of a higher order. There's
no order in me, no higher order. But ... that's all over. There's
no need to grieve about it. It's too late, damn it! My whole
life has been disorder, and one must set it in order. Is that a
pun, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're raving, not making puns!</q>

<q>Why do you bring him in all of a sudden?</q>
</p>

<pb n='455'/><anchor id='Pg455'/>

<p>
<q>Why do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end;

</p>

<p>
<q>You know, I keep thinking of your pistols.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's all foolery, too! Drink, and don't be fanciful. I love
life. I've loved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Let's
drink to life, dear boy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with
myself? I'm a scoundrel, but I'm satisfied with myself. And yet
I'm tortured by the thought that I'm a scoundrel, but satisfied with
myself. I bless the creation. I'm ready to bless God and His creation
directly, but ... I must kill one noxious insect for fear it
should crawl and spoil life for others.... Let us drink to life,
dear brother. What can be more precious than life? Nothing!
To life, and to one queen of queens!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
They drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive,
yet he was melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy,
overwhelming anxiety were weighing upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Misha ... here's your Misha come! Misha, come here, my
boy, drink this glass to Phœbus, the golden-haired, of to-morrow
morn....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you giving it him for?</q> cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>E&mdash;ech!</q>
</p>

<p>
Misha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out.
</p>

<p>
<q>He'll remember it afterwards,</q> Mitya remarked. <q>Woman, I
love woman! What is woman? The queen of creation! My heart
is sad, my heart is sad, Pyotr Ilyitch. Do you remember Hamlet?
<q>I am very sorry, good Horatio! Alas, poor Yorick!</q> Perhaps that's
me, Yorick? Yes, I'm Yorick now, and a skull afterwards.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a
while.
</p>

<p>
<q>What dog's that you've got here?</q> he asked the shopman, casually,
noticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes, sitting in the
corner.
</p>

<p>
<q>It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,</q> answered the
clerk. <q>She brought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back
to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I saw one like it ... in the regiment ...</q> murmured Mitya
<pb n='456'/><anchor id='Pg456'/>
dreamily, <q>only that one had its hind leg broken.... By the
way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wanted to ask you: have you ever stolen anything
in your life?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a question!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I didn't mean anything. From somebody's pocket, you
know. I don't mean government money, every one steals that, and
no doubt you do, too....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You go to the devil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm talking of other people's money. Stealing straight out of a
pocket? Out of a purse, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years
old. I took it off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my
hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, and what happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed,
and gave it back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you
stolen something?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> said Mitya, winking slyly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have you stolen?</q> inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years
old, and gave it back three days after.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won't you come now?</q> called Andrey from
the door of the shop.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you ready? We'll come!</q> Mitya started. <q>A few more
last words and&mdash;Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him
some brandy as well! That box</q> (the one with the pistols) <q>put
under my seat. Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch, don't remember evil
against me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you're coming back to-morrow?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you settle the little bill now?</q> cried the clerk, springing
forward.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, the bill. Of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out
three hundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly
<pb n='457'/><anchor id='Pg457'/>
out of the shop. Every one followed him out, bowing and
wishing him good luck. Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had
just swallowed, jumped up on the box. But Mitya was only just
taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before
him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before him with a cry,
and plumped down at his feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don't
harm my mistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And
don't murder him, he came first, he's hers! He'll marry Agrafena
Alexandrovna now. That's why he's come back from Siberia.
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don't take a fellow creature's life!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut! That's it, is it? So you're off there to make
trouble!</q> muttered Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>Now, it's all clear, as clear as
daylight. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you
mean to behave like a man,</q> he shouted aloud to Mitya. <q>Do you
hear, Dmitri?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I'll throw them into the pool
on the road,</q> answered Mitya. <q>Fenya, get up, don't kneel to me.
Mitya won't hurt any one, the silly fool won't hurt any one again.
But I say, Fenya,</q> he shouted, after having taken his seat. <q>I hurt
you just now, so forgive me and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel....
But it doesn't matter if you don't. It's all the same now.
Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full speed!</q>
</p>

<p>
Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,</q> Pyotr
Ilyitch thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay
and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions,
knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly
feeling vexed with himself, he turned away with a curse and
went to the tavern to play billiards.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a fool, though he's a good fellow,</q> he muttered as he went.
<q>I've heard of that officer, Grushenka's former flame. Well, if he
has turned up.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I'm not his
nurse! Let them do what they like! Besides, it'll all come to
nothing. They're a set of brawlers, that's all. They'll drink and
fight, fight and make friends again. They are not men who do
anything real. What does he mean by <q>I'm stepping aside, I'm punishing
<pb n='458'/><anchor id='Pg458'/>
myself?</q> It'll come to nothing! He's shouted such phrases
a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he's not drunk.
<q>Drunk in spirit</q>&mdash;they're fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I
his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood.
With whom? I shall find out at the <q>Metropolis.</q> And his handkerchief
was soaked in blood.... It's still lying on my floor....
Hang it!</q>
</p>

<p>
He reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a
game. The game cheered him. He played a second game, and
suddenly began telling one of his partners that Dmitri Karamazov
had come in for some cash again&mdash;something like three thousand
roubles, and had gone to Mokroe again to spend it with Grushenka....
This news roused singular interest in his listeners. They all
spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity. They left off
playing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov's present
was received with skepticism.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hasn't he robbed his old father?&mdash;that's the question.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand! There's something odd about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him,
here. And it was three thousand he talked about ...</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in
his answers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya's face
and hands, though he had meant to speak of it at first.
</p>

<p>
They began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya
died away. But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no
more desire for billiards; he laid down the cue, and without having
supper as he had intended, he walked out of the tavern. When he
reached the market-place he stood still in perplexity, wondering at
himself. He realized that what he wanted was to go to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's and find out if anything had happened there. <q>On
account of some stupid nonsense&mdash;as it's sure to turn out&mdash;am I
going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn
it, is it my business to look after them?</q>
</p>

<p>
In a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered
Fenya. <q>Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her
just now,</q> he thought with vexation, <q>I should have heard everything.</q>
<pb n='459'/><anchor id='Pg459'/>
And the desire to speak to her, and so find out, became so
pressing and importunate that when he was half-way home he
turned abruptly and went towards the house where Grushenka
lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock
in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed.
And no one answered him; every one in the house was asleep.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I shall be making a fuss!</q> he thought, with a feeling of
positive discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell
to knocking again with all his might, filling the street with clamor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!</q> he muttered
at each knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled
his knocks on the gate.
</p>

<p>
But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was
a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey's three
horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered
in an hour and a quarter. The swift motion revived Mitya. The
air was fresh and cool, there were big stars shining in the sky. It
was the very night, and perhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha
fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.
</p>

<p>
All was confusion, confusion, in Mitya's soul, but although many
things were goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was
yearning for her, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her
for the last time. One thing I can say for certain; his heart did not
waver for one instant. I shall perhaps not be believed when I say
that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new
rival, who seemed to have sprung out of the earth. If any other
had appeared on the scene, he would have been jealous at once, and
would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again. But
as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no hostility even, for
the man who had been her first lover.... It is true he had not yet
seen him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his;
<pb n='460'/><anchor id='Pg460'/>
this was her first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten;
so she had loved him only for those five years, and I, how do I
come in? What right have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way!
What am I now? Now everything is over apart from the officer&mdash;even
if he had not appeared, everything would be over ...</q>
</p>

<p>
These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had
been capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment.
His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At
Fenya's first words, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted
in a flash, with all its consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution,
there was confusion in his soul, an agonizing confusion: his
resolution did not give him peace. There was so much behind that
tortured him. And it seemed strange to him, at moments, to think
that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper:
<q>I punish myself,</q> and the paper was lying there in his pocket,
ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next
morning, he would meet the first warm ray of <q>golden-haired
Phœbus.</q>
</p>

<p>
And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left
behind and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the
thought of it sank into his heart with despair. There was one moment
when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey, to jump out of the
cart, to pull out his loaded pistol, and to make an end of everything
without waiting for the dawn. But that moment flew by like a
spark. The horses galloped on, <q>devouring space,</q> and as he drew
near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took more
and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearful
images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon
her, if only for a moment, if only from a distance!
</p>

<p>
<q>She's now with <emph>him</emph>,</q> he thought, <q>now I shall see what she
looks like with him, her first love, and that's all I want.</q> Never had
this woman, who was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused
such love in his breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising
even to himself, a feeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement
before her! <q>I will efface myself!</q> he said, in a rush of almost
hysterical ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
They had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and
though Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter
<pb n='461'/><anchor id='Pg461'/>
a word, either. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up
smartly his three lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya
cried out in horrible anxiety:
</p>

<p>
<q>Andrey! What if they're asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to
him before.
</p>

<p>
<q>It may well be that they're gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing
there ... with such feelings ... while they were asleep ...
she was asleep, perhaps, there too.... An angry feeling surged up
in his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!</q> he cried, beside
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>But maybe they're not in bed!</q> Andrey went on after a pause.
<q>Timofey said they were a lot of them there&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At the station?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn, where
they let out horses, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that?
Who are they?</q> cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected
news.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our
town&mdash;who they are I can't say&mdash;and there are two others, strangers,
maybe more besides. I didn't ask particularly. They've set to
playing cards, so Timofey said.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards. It's most likely
not more than eleven.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!</q> Mitya cried again, nervously.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I ask you something, sir?</q> said Andrey, after a pause.
<q>Only I'm afraid of angering you, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you
not to harm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see,
sir&mdash; It's I am taking you there ... forgive me, sir, it's my conscience ...
maybe it's stupid of me to speak of it&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.
</p>

<pb n='462'/><anchor id='Pg462'/>

<p>
<q>Are you a driver?</q> he asked frantically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you know that one has to make way. What would you
say to a driver who wouldn't make way for any one, but would
just drive on and crush people? No, a driver mustn't run over
people. One can't run over a man. One can't spoil people's lives.
And if you have spoilt a life&mdash;punish yourself.... If only you've
spoilt, if only you've ruined any one's life&mdash;punish yourself and go
away.</q>
</p>

<p>
These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though
Andrey was surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one
mustn't crush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every
creature is created by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some
folks, even among us drivers, drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain
them, they just force it along.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To hell?</q> Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short
laugh. <q>Andrey, simple soul,</q> he seized him by the shoulders again,
<q>tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not,
what do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you
see, sir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He
went straight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners
that were in agony. And the devil groaned, because he thought
that he would get no more sinners in hell. And God said to him,
then, <q>Don't groan, for you shall have all the mighty of the earth,
the rulers, the chief judges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up
as you have been in all the ages till I come again.</q> Those were His
very words ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you see, sir, who it is hell's for,</q> said Andrey, whipping up
the left horse, <q>but you're like a little child ... that's how we
look on you ... and though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God
will forgive you for your kind heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any
harm.</q>
</p>

<pb n='463'/><anchor id='Pg463'/>

<p>
<q>No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road,
will you forgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering
to himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn
me. Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for
I have condemned myself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee,
O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love Thee. If Thou sendest me to
hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there I shall cry out that I
love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love to the end....
Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of Thy
day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannot
help loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop
up, I shall fall before her and say, <q>You are right to pass on and
leave me. Farewell and forget your victim ... never fret yourself
about me!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mokroe!</q> cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.
</p>

<p>
Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass
of buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village
of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour
all were asleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on, Andrey, I come!</q> Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.
</p>

<p>
<q>They're not asleep,</q> said Andrey again, pointing with his whip
to the Plastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village.
The six windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.
</p>

<p>
<q>They're not asleep,</q> Mitya repeated joyously. <q>Quicker,
Andrey! Gallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing!
Let all know that I have come. I'm coming! I'm coming, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash
and pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.
</p>

<p>
Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way
to bed, peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.
</p>

<p>
<q>Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?</q>
</p>

<p>
The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps,
and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?</q>
</p>

<pb n='464'/><anchor id='Pg464'/>

<p>
Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle
height, with a rather fat face. His expression was severe and
uncompromising, especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had
the power of assuming the most obsequious countenance, when he
had an inkling that it was to his interest. He dressed in Russian
style, with a shirt buttoning down on one side, and a full-skirted
coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was for ever dreaming
of improving his position. More than half the peasants were in
his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him.
From the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which
were worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could
never shake off. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters.
One of them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her two
children, his grandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman.
Another of his daughters was married to a petty official, and in one
of the rooms of the inn, on the wall could be seen, among the family
photographs, a miniature photograph of this official in uniform and
official epaulettes. The two younger daughters used to wear fashionable
blue or green dresses, fitting tight at the back, and with
trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when they went to pay
visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as usual, sweep
out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean up
after lodgers.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch
was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest,
and remembering that not a month ago he had, in twenty-four
hours, made two if not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when
he had come on his escapade with Grushenka, he met him now with
eager welcome, scenting his prey the moment Mitya drove up to
the steps.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,</q> began Mitya, <q>first and foremost,
where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Agrafena Alexandrovna?</q> The inn-keeper understood at once,
looking sharply into Mitya's face. <q>She's here, too ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With whom? With whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge
from his speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there's
<pb n='465'/><anchor id='Pg465'/>
another with him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there's no
telling. They're dressed like civilians.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, are they feasting? Have they money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They're two gentlemen from the town.... They've come back
from Tcherny, and are putting up here. One's quite a young gentleman,
a relative of Mr. Miüsov, he must be, but I've forgotten
his name ... and I expect you know the other, too, a gentleman
called Maximov. He's been on a pilgrimage, so he says, to the
monastery in the town. He's traveling with this young relation
of Mr. Miüsov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that all?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What
of her? How is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, she's only just come. She's sitting with them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I think she's not laughing much. She's sitting quite dull.
She's combing the young gentleman's hair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Pole&mdash;the officer?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's not young, and he's not an officer, either. Not him, sir.
It's the young gentleman that's Mr. Miüsov's relation ... I've forgotten
his name.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Kalganov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's it, Kalganov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right. I'll see for myself. Are they playing cards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been
drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for myself.
Now answer one more question: are the gypsies here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The
authorities have sent them away. But we've Jews that play the
cymbals and the fiddle in the village, so one might send for them.
They'd come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Send for them. Certainly send for them!</q> cried Mitya. <q>And
you can get the girls together as you did then, Marya especially,
Stepanida, too, and Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!</q>
</p>

<pb n='466'/><anchor id='Pg466'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though
by now they're asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like
that on such coarseness and rudeness! What's the good of giving a
peasant a cigar to smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are
all lousy. Besides, I'll get my daughters up for nothing, let alone
a sum like that. They've only just gone to bed, I'll give them a
kick and set them singing for you. You gave the peasants champagne
to drink the other day, e&mdash;ech!</q>
</p>

<p>
For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch
had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion,
and had picked up a hundred-rouble note under the table, and
it had remained in his clutches.
</p>

<p>
<q>Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last
time I was here. Do you remember?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have
left three thousand behind you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?</q>
</p>

<p>
And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the
innkeeper's nose.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, listen and remember. In an hour's time the wine will arrive,
