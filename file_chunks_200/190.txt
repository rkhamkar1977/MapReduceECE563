<q>We gave these three thousand together&mdash;Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna
and I&mdash;but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow
herself. The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but
the case has become known all over Russia; it's talked of in all the
papers and journals. Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the
glory of the thing, because the case has become so notorious. I saw
him yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well? Did you talk to him?</q> Grushenka put in eagerly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already
formed his opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They'll ruin him. And
why did she send for the doctor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya's mad and committed
the murder when he didn't know what he was doing</q>;
Alyosha smiled gently; <q>but Mitya won't agree to that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!</q> cried
Grushenka. <q>He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my
fault, wretch that I am! But, of course, he didn't do it, he didn't
do it! And they are all against him, the whole town. Even Fenya's
evidence went to prove he had done it. And the people at the shop,
and that official, and at the tavern, too, before, people had heard
him say so! They are all, all against him, all crying out against
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there's a fearful accumulation of evidence,</q> Alyosha observed
grimly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And Grigory&mdash;Grigory Vassilyevitch&mdash;sticks to his story that
the door was open, persists that he saw it&mdash;there's no shaking him.
I went and talked to him myself. He's rude about it, too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='641'/><anchor id='Pg641'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, that's perhaps the strongest evidence against him,</q> said
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>And as for Mitya's being mad, he certainly seems like it now,</q>
Grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air.
<q>Do you know, Alyosha, I've been wanting to talk to you about it
for a long time. I go to him every day and simply wonder at him.
Tell me, now, what do you suppose he's always talking about? He
talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. I fancied he was
talking of something intellectual that I couldn't understand in my
foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe&mdash;that
is, about some child. <q>Why is the babe poor?</q> he said. <q>It's
for that babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but
I must go to Siberia!</q> What that meant, what babe, I couldn't
tell for the life of me. Only I cried when he said it, because he
said it so nicely. He cried himself, and I cried, too. He suddenly
kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me. What did it
mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be Rakitin, who's been going to see him lately,</q> smiled
Alyosha, <q>though ... that's not Rakitin's doing. I didn't see
Mitya yesterday. I'll see him to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not Rakitin; it's his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting
him. It's his going to see him, that's what it is,</q> Grushenka
began, and suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself
that Ivan hasn't been once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There ... there! What a girl I am! Blurring things out!</q>
exclaimed Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. <q>Stay,
Alyosha, hush! Since I've said so much I'll tell the whole truth&mdash;he's
been to see him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped
here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and
the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you
about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact.
He came secretly.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The
news evidently impressed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan doesn't talk to me of Mitya's case,</q> he said slowly. <q>He's
said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go
to see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I've not been to him
<pb n='642'/><anchor id='Pg642'/>
for the last three weeks. H'm!... if he was there a week ago ...
there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There has been a change,</q> Grushenka assented quickly. <q>They
have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was
a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can't rest. Before then, he was
cheerful&mdash;and, indeed, he is cheerful now&mdash;but when he shakes his
head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling
at the hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know there
is something on his mind worrying him.... I know! He was
cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you said he was worried.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable
for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you
know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him&mdash;with this awful
thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as
though he were a baby himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he
say, <q>Don't tell him</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he told me, <q>Don't tell him.</q> It's you that Mitya's most
afraid of. Because it's a secret: he said himself it was a secret.
Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and
come and tell me,</q> Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness.
<q>Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that's in store for
me. That's why I sent for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think it's something to do with you? If it were, he
wouldn't have told you there was a secret.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn't dare to.
He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won't tell me
what it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you think yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do I think? It's the end for me, that's what I think.
They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina's in it. It's
all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that
means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand&mdash;warns me.
He is planning to throw me over, that's the whole secret. They've
planned it together, the three of them&mdash;Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan
Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I've been wanting to ask you a long time.
A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina,
<pb n='643'/><anchor id='Pg643'/>
because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not?
Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna,
I think.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, that's what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver,
that's what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as
to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can't disguise
what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I'll give it to
him, I'll give it to him! <q>You believe I did it,</q> he said. He said
that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him!
You wait, I'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I'll just say a
word then ... I'll tell everything then!</q>
</p>

<p>
And again she cried bitterly.
</p>

<p>
<q>This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,</q> Alyosha said, getting
up. <q>First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the
world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second
thing is that I don't want to worm his secret out of him, but if
he'll tell me of himself to-day, I shall tell him straight out that I
have promised to tell you. Then I'll come to you to-day, and tell
you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to
do with it, and that the secret is about something else. That's certain.
It isn't likely it's about Katerina Ivanovna, it seems to me.
Good-by for now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He
saw that she put little faith in his consolation, but she was better
for having had her sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was
sorry to leave her in such a state of mind, but he was in haste. He
had a great many things to do still.

<head>Chapter II. The Injured Foot</head>

<p>
The first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov,
and he hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not
be too late for Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing
for the last three weeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up,
<pb n='644'/><anchor id='Pg644'/>
and though she was not in bed, she lay all day half-reclining on the
couch in her boudoir, in a fascinating but decorous
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>déshabillé</foreign>.
Alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that, in spite of
her illness, Madame Hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy&mdash;top-knots,
ribbons, loose wrappers, had made their appearance, and he
had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed such ideas from
his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the young
official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go
straight to Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had
sent a maid to him the previous day, specially asking him to come
to her <q>about something very important,</q> a request which, for certain
reasons, had interest for Alyosha. But while the maid went
to take his name in to Lise, Madame Hohlakov heard of his arrival
from some one, and immediately sent to beg him to come to her
<q>just for one minute.</q> Alyosha reflected that it was better to
accede to the mamma's request, or else she would be sending down
to Lise's room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov
was lying on a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was
evidently in a state of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted
Alyosha with cries of rapture.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's ages, ages, perfect ages since I've seen you! It's a whole
week&mdash;only think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago,
on Wednesday. You have come to see Lise. I'm sure you meant
to slip into her room on tiptoe, without my hearing you. My dear,
dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only knew how worried I am
about her! But of that later, though that's the most important
thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly
with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima&mdash;God
rest his soul!</q> (she crossed herself)&mdash;<q>I look upon you as a monk,
though you look charming in your new suit. Where did you find
such a tailor in these parts? No, no, that's not the chief thing&mdash;of
that later. Forgive me for sometimes calling you Alyosha; an
old woman like me may take liberties,</q> she smiled coquettishly;
<q>but that will do later, too. The important thing is that I shouldn't
forget what is important. Please remind me of it yourself. As soon
as my tongue runs away with me, you just say <q>the important thing?</q>
Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever since
<pb n='645'/><anchor id='Pg645'/>
Lise took back her promise&mdash;her childish promise, Alexey Fyodorovitch&mdash;to
marry you, you've realized, of course, that it was only
the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to
her chair&mdash;thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor
Katya sent for from Moscow for your unhappy brother, who will
to-morrow&mdash;But why speak of to-morrow? I am ready to die at
the very thought of to-morrow. Ready to die of curiosity....
That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I paid him
fifty roubles for the visit. But that's not the point, that's not the
point again. You see, I'm mixing everything up. I am in such a
hurry. Why am I in a hurry? I don't understand. It's awful how
I seem growing unable to understand anything. Everything seems
mixed up in a sort of tangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will
jump up and run away, and that will be all I shall see of you.
Goodness! Why are we sitting here and no coffee? Yulia, Glafira,
coffee!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just
had coffee.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At Agrafena Alexandrovna's.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At ... at that woman's? Ah, it's she has brought ruin on
every one. I know nothing about it though. They say she has
become a saint, though it's rather late in the day. She had better
have done it before. What use is it now? Hush, hush, Alexey
Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you that I am afraid I
shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shall certainly go, I
am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my chair;
besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know,
I am a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don't know
what I shall say. One has to take an oath, hasn't one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; but I don't think you will be able to go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage
act, and then they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married,
and all this so quickly, so quickly, everything's changing, and at
last&mdash;nothing. All grow old and have death to look forward to.
Well, so be it! I am weary. This Katya,
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>cette charmante personne</foreign>,
has disappointed all my hopes. Now she is going to follow one of
your brothers to Siberia, and your other brother is going to follow
<pb n='646'/><anchor id='Pg646'/>
her, and will live in the nearest town, and they will all torment one
another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of all&mdash;the publicity.
The story has been told a million times over in all the papers in
Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there's a
paragraph that I was <q>a dear friend</q> of your brother's &mdash;&mdash;, I can't
repeat the horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday.
Here, in the Petersburg paper <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi>. The paper began coming out
this year. I am awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now
it pays me out&mdash;this is what gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this
passage. Read it.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been
under her pillow.
</p>

<p>
It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed
and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head.
The paragraph was very typical, and must have been a great shock
to her, but, fortunately perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind
fixed on any one subject at that moment, and so might race off in
a minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had
spread all over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about
his brother, about the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read
in the course of those two months, among other equally credible
items! One paper had even stated that he had gone into a monastery
and become a monk, in horror at his brother's crime. Another contradicted
this, and stated that he and his elder, Father Zossima, had
broken into the monastery chest and <q>made tracks from the monastery.</q>
The present paragraph in the paper <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi> was under the
heading, <q>The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.</q> (That, alas!
was the name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.)
It was brief, and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in
it. No names appeared, in fact. It was merely stated that the
criminal, whose approaching trial was making such a sensation&mdash;retired
army captain, an idle swaggerer, and reactionary bully&mdash;was
continually involved in amorous intrigues, and particularly popular
with certain ladies <q>who were pining in solitude.</q> One such lady,
a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a grown-up
<pb n='647'/><anchor id='Pg647'/>
daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before
the crime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that
he would elope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting
on escaping punishment, had preferred to murder his father to
get the three thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged
charms of his pining lady. This playful paragraph finished, of
course, with an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness
of parricide and at the lately abolished institution of serfdom.
Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha folded up the paper and handed
it back to Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that must be me,</q> she hurried on again. <q>Of course I
am meant. Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold
mines to him, and here they talk of <q>middle-aged charms</q> as though
that were my motive! He writes that out of spite! God Almighty
forgive him for the middle-aged charms, as I forgive him! You
know it's&mdash; Do you know who it is? It's your friend Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps,</q> said Alyosha, <q>though I've heard nothing about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's he, it's he! No <q>perhaps</q> about it. You know I turned
him out of the house.... You know all that story, don't you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but
why it was, I haven't heard ... from you, at least.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, then you've heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose,
abuses me dreadfully?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you've
given him up I haven't heard from him either. I meet him very
seldom now, indeed. We are not friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, I'll tell you all about it. There's no help for it,
I'll confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame.
Only a little, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn't count.
You see, my dear boy</q>&mdash;Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch
and a charming, though enigmatic, smile played about her lips&mdash;<q rend='pre'>you
see, I suspect ... You must forgive me, Alyosha. I am like
a mother to you.... No, no; quite the contrary. I speak to you
now as though you were my father&mdash;mother's quite out of place.
Well, it's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima, that's just
it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man, your
friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can't be angry with him. I feel
cross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe
<pb n='648'/><anchor id='Pg648'/>
it, seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I
only noticed it later. At first&mdash;a month ago&mdash;he only began to
come oftener to see me, almost every day; though, of course, we
were acquainted before. I knew nothing about it ... and suddenly
it dawned upon me, and I began to notice things with surprise.
You know, two months ago, that modest, charming, excellent young
man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who's in the service here, began to be a
regular visitor at the house. You met him here ever so many times
yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man, isn't he? He
comes once every three days, not every day (though I should be glad
to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I love
young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost
the mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,
certainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat.
On that awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the
night. And your friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always
stretches them out on the carpet.... He began hinting at his
feelings, in fact, and one day, as he was going, he squeezed my hand
terribly hard. My foot began to swell directly after he pressed my
hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here before, and would
you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling at him, for some
reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together and
laughed inwardly. So I was sitting here alone&mdash;no, I was laid up
then. Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in,
and only fancy! brought me some verses of his own composition&mdash;a
short poem, on my bad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem.
Wait a minute&mdash;how did it go?</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>A captivating little foot.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I've got
it here. I'll show it to you later. But it's a charming thing&mdash;charming;
and, you know, it's not only about the foot, it had a
good moral, too, a charming idea, only I've forgotten it; in fact, it
was just the thing for an album. So, of course, I thanked him, and
he was evidently flattered. I'd hardly had time to thank him when
in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly looked as black as
night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way, for Rakitin
certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses. I
<pb n='649'/><anchor id='Pg649'/>
had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr
Ilyitch the verses and didn't say who was the author. But I am
convinced that he guessed, though he won't own it to this day, and
declares he had no idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch
began to laugh at once, and fell to criticizing it. <q>Wretched doggerel,</q>
he said they were, <q>some divinity student must have written
them,</q> and with such vehemence, such vehemence! Then, instead
of laughing, your friend flew into a rage. <q>Good gracious!</q> I
thought, <q>they'll fly at each other.</q> <q>It was I who wrote them,</q> said
he. <q>I wrote them as a joke,</q> he said, <q>for I think it degrading to
write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a
monument to your Pushkin for writing about women's feet, while
I wrote with a moral purpose, and you,</q> said he, <q>are an advocate
of serfdom. You've no humane ideas,</q> said he. <q>You have no modern
enlightened feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are
a mere official,</q> he said, <q>and you take bribes.</q> Then I began screaming
and imploring them. And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything
but a coward. He at once took up the most gentlemanly tone,
looked at him sarcastically, listened, and apologized. <q>I'd no idea,</q>
said he. <q>I shouldn't have said it, if I had known. I should have
praised it. Poets are all so irritable,</q> he said. In short, he laughed at
him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He explained to
me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was in earnest.
Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, <q>Would it,
or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for
shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?</q> And, would you believe
it, I lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the
proper thing or not. I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart
began to beat, and I couldn't make up my mind whether to make
an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be telling me, <q>Speak,</q> and
the other <q>No, don't speak.</q> And no sooner had the second voice
said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, there was a fuss.
I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, <q>It's painful for me to say it,
but I don't wish to see you in my house again.</q> So I turned him out.
Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting
it on. I wasn't angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly
fancied&mdash;that was what did it&mdash;that it would be such a fine scene....
And yet, believe me, it was quite natural, for I really shed
<pb n='650'/><anchor id='Pg650'/>
tears and cried for several days afterwards, and then suddenly, one
afternoon, I forgot all about it. So it's a fortnight since he's been
here, and I kept wondering whether he would come again. I wondered
even yesterday, then suddenly last night came this <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi>.
I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He must have
written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it,
and they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha,
it's awful how I keep talking and don't say what I want to say.
Ah! the words come of themselves!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,</q>
Alyosha faltered.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen,
what is an aberration?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What aberration?</q> asked Alyosha, wondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.
Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming
creature, only I never can make out who it is she is in love
with. She was with me some time ago and I couldn't get anything
out of her. Especially as she won't talk to me except on the surface
now. She is always talking about my health and nothing else,
and she takes up such a tone with me, too. I simply said to myself,
<q>Well, so be it. I don't care</q>... Oh, yes. I was talking of aberration.
This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come? Of
course, you know it&mdash;the one who discovers madmen. You wrote
for him. No, it wasn't you, but Katya. It's all Katya's doing.
Well, you see, a man may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly
have an aberration. He may be conscious and know what he is doing
and yet be in a state of aberration. And there's no doubt that
Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from aberration. They found
out about aberration as soon as the law courts were reformed. It's
all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctor has been
here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines.
<q>How did he seem then?</q> he asked me. He must have been in a
state of aberration. He came in shouting, <q>Money, money, three
thousand! Give me three thousand!</q> and then went away and
immediately did the murder. <q>I don't want to murder him,</q> he said,
<pb n='651'/><anchor id='Pg651'/>
and he suddenly went and murdered him. That's why they'll acquit
him, because he struggled against it and yet he murdered him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But he didn't murder him,</q> Alyosha interrupted rather sharply.
He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grigory?</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck
him down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed
Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why, why?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow
Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from
aberration; he went and committed the murder. As for his saying
he didn't, he very likely doesn't remember. Only, you know, it'll be
better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him.
And that's how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory.
It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that's better, ever so
much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his
father, I don't defend that. Children ought to honor their parents,
and yet it would be better if it were he, as you'd have nothing to
cry over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when
he was conscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them
acquit him&mdash;that's so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed
law courts are. I knew nothing about it, but they say they
have been so a long time. And when I heard it yesterday, I was
so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at once. And if
he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courts to
dinner with me, and I'll have a party of friends, and we'll drink to
the reformed law courts. I don't believe he'd be dangerous; besides,
I'll invite a great many friends, so that he could always be
led out if he did anything. And then he might be made a justice
of the peace or something in another town, for those who have been
in trouble themselves make the best judges. And, besides, who isn't
suffering from aberration nowadays?&mdash;you, I, all of us are in a state
of aberration, and there are ever so many examples of it: a man
sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him, he takes a pistol
and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one blames
him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The
<pb n='652'/><anchor id='Pg652'/>
doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my
Lise is in a state of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday,
and the day before, too, and to-day I suddenly realized that it's all
due to aberration. Oh, Lise grieves me so! I believe she's quite mad.
Why did she send for you? Did she send for you or did you come
of yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.</q> Alyosha got
up resolutely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that's what's
most important,</q> Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into
tears. <q>God knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it's
no matter her sending for you on the sly, without telling her mother.
But forgive me, I can't trust my daughter so easily to your brother
Ivan Fyodorovitch, though I still consider him the most chivalrous
young man. But only fancy, he's been to see Lise and I knew nothing
about it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How? What? When?</q> Alyosha was exceedingly surprised.
He had not sat down again and listened standing.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will tell you; that's perhaps why I asked you to come, for I
don't know now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch
has been to see me twice, since he came back from Moscow.
First time he came as a friend to call on me, and the second time
Katya was here and he came because he heard she was here. I
didn't, of course, expect him to come often, knowing what a lot he
has to do as it is, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>vous comprenez, cette affaire et
la mort terrible de votre papa</foreign>. But I suddenly heard he'd been here again,
not to see me but to see Lise. That's six days ago now. He came, stayed five
minutes, and went away. And I didn't hear of it till three days
afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for
Lise directly. She laughed. <q>He thought you were asleep,</q> she said,
<q>and came in to me to ask after your health.</q> Of course, that's how
it happened. But Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me!
Would you believe it, one night, four days ago, just after you saw
her last time, and had gone away, she suddenly had a fit, screaming,
shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never have hysterics? Then, next
day another fit, and the same thing on the third, and yesterday too,
and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly screamed out, <q>I
hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting him come to
<pb n='653'/><anchor id='Pg653'/>
the house again.</q> I was struck dumb at these amazing words, and
answered, <q>On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent
young man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?</q>&mdash;for
all this business is a misfortune, isn't it? She suddenly burst
out laughing at my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was
pleased; I thought I had amused her and the fits would pass off,
especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on
account of his strange visits without my knowledge, and meant to
ask him for an explanation. But early this morning Lise waked up
and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you believe it, slapped
her in the face. That's monstrous; I am always polite to my servants.
And an hour later she was hugging Yulia's feet and kissing
them. She sent a message to me that she wasn't coming to me at
all, and would never come and see me again, and when I dragged
myself down to her, she rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed
me, she pushed me out of the room without saying a word, so I
couldn't find out what was the matter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,
I rest all my hopes on you, and, of course, my whole life is in
your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and find out everything
from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell me&mdash;me, her
mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply the
death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand no
more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then
something awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr
Ilyitch!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin
enter the room. <q>You are late, you are late! Well, sit down,
speak, put us out of suspense. What does the counsel say. Where
are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Lise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes. You won't forget, you won't forget what I asked you?
It's a question of life and death!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I won't forget, if I can ... but I am so late,</q> muttered
Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, be sure, be sure to come in; don't say <q>If you can.</q> I shall
die if you don't,</q> Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha
had already left the room.

<head>Chapter III. A Little Demon</head>

<p>
Going in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair,
in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to
walk. She did not move to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were
simply riveted on his face. There was a feverish look in her eyes, her
face was pale and yellow. Alyosha was amazed at the change that
had taken place in her in three days. She was positively thinner.
She did not hold out her hand to him. He touched the thin, long
fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he sat down facing
her, without a word.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,</q> Lise said
curtly, <q>and mamma's kept you there for hours; she's just been telling
you about me and Yulia.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen
and I do listen, there's no harm in that. I don't apologize.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are upset about something?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been reflecting
for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and
shall not be your wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were
to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after
you, you'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer
back, too. If you were forty, you would still go on taking my
love-letters for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
She suddenly laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,</q>
Alyosha smiled to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself
with you. What's more, I don't want to feel ashamed with you,
just with you. Alyosha, why is it I don't respect you? I am very
fond of you, but I don't respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn't
talk to you without shame, should I?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<pb n='655'/><anchor id='Pg655'/>

<p>
<q>But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison.
Alyosha, you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully
for having so quickly allowed me not to love you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one
to torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go
away. I don't want to be happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are in love with disorder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I
keep imagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the
sly; it must be on the sly. They'll try to put it out, but it'll go on
burning. And I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness!
And how bored I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's your luxurious life,</q> said Alyosha, softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it better, then, to be poor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is better.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what your monk taught you. That's not true. Let me
be rich and all the rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and
not give any to any one else. Ach, don't speak, don't say anything,</q>
she shook her hand at him, though Alyosha had not opened
his mouth. <q>You've told me all that before, I know it all by heart.
It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder somebody, and even
if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps&mdash;why do nothing!
But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry
you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt,
shall we? Do you know Kalganov?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, <q>Why live in
real life? It's better to dream. One can dream the most delightful
things, but real life is a bore.</q> But he'll be married soon for all that;
he's been making love to me already. Can you spin tops?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, he's just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning
<pb n='656'/><anchor id='Pg656'/>
and then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry
him, I'll keep him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be
with me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things.
I don't want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world
for the greatest sin? You must know all about that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God will censure you.</q> Alyosha was watching her steadily.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just what I should like. I would go up and they would
censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should
dreadfully like to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you
still don't believe me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing
to set fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It's
a sort of disease.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but
that's not what I mean.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your
illness, perhaps.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You do despise me, though! It's simply that I don't want to do
good, I want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do evil?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would
be if everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes
think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I
should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly every one
would find it out. Every one will stand round and point their fingers
at me and I would look at them all. That would be awfully nice.
Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as
you say, to set fire to something. It happens sometimes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I not only say it, I shall do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not
lying one little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this
on purpose to annoy you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't think that ... though perhaps there is a little
desire to do that in it, too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='657'/><anchor id='Pg657'/>

<p>
<q>There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,</q> she declared, with
a strange fire in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness.
There was not a trace of humor or jesting in her face now, though,
in old days, fun and gayety never deserted her even at her most
<q>earnest</q> moments.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are moments when people love crime,</q> said Alyosha
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every
one loves crime, they love it always, not at some <q>moments.</q> You
know, it's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it
and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they hate
evil, but secretly they all love it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And are you still reading nasty books?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow
and I steal them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you ashamed to destroy yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I want to destroy myself. There's a boy here, who lay down between
the railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow!
Listen, your brother is being tried now for murdering his father
and every one loves his having killed his father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Loves his having killed his father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it's so awful,
but secretly they simply love it. I for one love it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is some truth in what you say about every one,</q> said
Alyosha softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, what ideas you have!</q> Lise shrieked in delight. <q>And you a
monk, too! You wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for
never telling lies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I
sometimes dream of devils. It's night; I am in my room with a
candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the
corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there's a crowd of
them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me. And
they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross myself
and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether, they
stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have
a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then
they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and
<pb n='658'/><anchor id='Pg658'/>
I cross myself again and they all draw back. It's awful fun. it
takes one's breath away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've had the same dream, too,</q> said Alyosha suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really?</q> cried Lise, surprised. <q>I say, Alyosha, don't laugh,
that's awfully important. Could two different people have the same
dream?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seems they can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important,</q> Lise went on, with
really excessive amazement. <q>It's not the dream that's important,
but your having the same dream as me. You never lie to me, don't
lie now: is it true? You are not laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's true.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she
was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,</q> she
said suddenly, in a supplicating voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll always come to see you, all my life,</q> answered Alyosha firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are the only person I can talk to, you know,</q> Lise began
again. <q>I talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole
world. And to you more readily than to myself. And I am not
a bit ashamed with you, not a bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed
with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it true that at Easter the Jews
steal a child and kill it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew,
who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both
hands, and then crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him
and crucified him, and afterwards, when he was tried, he said that
the child died soon, within four hours. That was <q>soon</q>! He said
the child moaned, kept on moaning and he stood admiring it. That's
nice!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nice?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him.
He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating
pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign>. I am
awfully fond of pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign>. Do
you like it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly
contorted, her eyes burned.
</p>

<pb n='659'/><anchor id='Pg659'/>

<p>
<q>You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all
night. I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a
child of four years old understands, you know), and all the while
the thought of pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign> haunted me. In the
morning I wrote a letter to a certain person, begging him <emph>particularly</emph> to
come and see me. He came and I suddenly told him all about the child
and the pineapple <foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign>. <emph>All</emph> about it,
<emph>all</emph>, and said that it
was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice. Then he got up
and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did he despise me?
Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise me
or not?</q> She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me,</q> Alyosha asked anxiously, <q>did you send for that
person?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I did.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you send him a letter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Simply to ask about that, about that child?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about
that at once. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That person behaved honorably,</q> Alyosha murmured.
</p>

<p>
<q>And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple
<foreign rend='italic'>compote</foreign> himself.
He is very ill now, too, Lise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he does believe in it,</q> said Lise, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>He doesn't despise any one,</q> Alyosha went on. <q>Only he does not
believe any one. If he doesn't believe in people, of course, he does
despise them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he despises me, me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good,</q> Lise seemed to grind her teeth. <q>When he went out
laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised. The child with
fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice....</q>
</p>

<p>
And she laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like&mdash;Alyosha,
save me!</q> She suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and
seized him with both hands. <q>Save me!</q> she almost groaned. <q>Is
there any one in the world I could tell what I've told you? I've
told you the truth, the truth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe
<pb n='660'/><anchor id='Pg660'/>
everything! I don't want to live, because I loathe everything! I
loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you love me in
the least?</q> she finished in a frenzy.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I do love you!</q> answered Alyosha warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And will you weep over me, will you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you! It's only your tears I want. Every one else may
punish me and trample me under foot, every one, every one, not
excepting <emph>any one</emph>. For I don't love any one. Do you hear, not any
one! On the contrary, I hate him! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went
to your brother</q>; she tore herself away from him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I leave you like this?</q> said Alyosha, almost in alarm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here's your hat.
Give my love to Mitya, go, go!</q>
</p>

<p>
And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He
looked at her with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of
a letter in his right hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed.
He glanced at it and instantly read the address, <q>To Ivan Fyodorovitch
Karamazov.</q> He looked quickly at Lise. Her face had
become almost menacing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Give it to him, you must give it to him!</q> she ordered him,
trembling and beside herself. <q>To-day, at once, or I'll poison myself!
That's why I sent for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha
put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without
going back to Madame Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon
as Alyosha had gone, Lise unbolted the door, opened it a little, put
her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might,
pinching her finger. Ten seconds after, releasing her finger, she
walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat up straight in it and looked
intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from
under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept whispering
rapidly to herself:
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!</q>

It was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha
rang at the prison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But
Alyosha knew that he would be admitted without difficulty. Things
were managed in our little town, as everywhere else. At first, of
course, on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, relations and
a few other persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going
through certain inevitable formalities. But later, though the
formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at
least, of Mitya's visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews
with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were
practically <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tête-à-tête</foreign>.

These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka,
Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the
police, Mihail Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka.
His abuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man's
