he came back. The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing
his Moscow address, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph
to him, and she, not knowing his address either, telegraphed
to her sister and aunt, reckoning on Ivan's going to see them as soon
as he arrived in Moscow. But he did not go to them till four days
<pb n='682'/><anchor id='Pg682'/>
after his arrival. When he got the telegram, he had, of course,
set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him was Alyosha,
and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to the
general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion
against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer.
Later on, after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and
hearing the details of the charge and the arrest, he was still more
surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated
brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha,
as Ivan knew, was very fond.
</p>

<p>
By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his
brother Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes
a compassion for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt,
almost repugnance. Mitya's whole personality, even his appearance,
was extremely unattractive to him. Ivan looked with
indignation on Katerina Ivanovna's love for his brother. Yet he
went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and that interview,
far from shaking Ivan's belief in his guilt, positively strengthened
it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya
had been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He
used violent language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled.
He talked principally about the three thousand roubles, which
he said had been <q>stolen</q> from him by his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>The money was mine, it was my money,</q> Mitya kept repeating.
<q>Even if I had stolen it, I should have had the right.</q>
</p>

<p>
He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to
turn a fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent
way. He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any
one else. Quite the contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful
of the charges against him; he was continually firing up and abusing
every one. He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory's evidence
about the open door, and declared that it was <q>the devil that opened
it.</q> But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of
the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first
interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared
that <q>everything was lawful,</q> to suspect and question him.
Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.
<pb n='683'/><anchor id='Pg683'/>
Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for
the first time to see Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking
of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening
before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling
and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating
lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He
put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in
the hospital.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the
hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan's persistent questions,
that Smerdyakov's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and
were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have
been shamming on the day of the catastrophe. They gave him to
understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting
and recurring several times, so that the patient's life was positively
in danger, and it was only now, after they had applied remedies,
that they could assert with confidence that the patient would
survive. <q>Though it might well be,</q> added Doctor Herzenstube,
<q>that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period, if not
permanently.</q> On Ivan's asking impatiently whether that meant
that he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case,
in the full sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were
perceptible. Ivan decided to find out for himself what those
abnormalities were.
</p>

<p>
At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov
was lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was
only one other bed in the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the
town, swollen with dropsy, who was obviously almost dying; he
could be no hindrance to their conversation. Smerdyakov grinned
uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the first instant seemed nervous.
So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only momentary. For the
rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by Smerdyakov's
composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he was
very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move his
tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout
the interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining
of headache and of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate
<pb n='684'/><anchor id='Pg684'/>
face seemed to have become so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his
crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye,
which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something,
Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. <q>It's always worth while
speaking to a clever man.</q> Ivan was reminded of that at once.
He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful
effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to speak.
He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you talk to me?</q> asked Ivan. <q>I won't tire you much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I can,</q> mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. <q>Has
your honor been back long?</q> he added patronizingly, as though
encouraging a nervous visitor.
</p>

<p>
<q>I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.</q>
Smerdyakov sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,</q> Ivan blurted out.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how
could I tell it would turn out like that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What would turn out? Don't prevaricate! You've foretold
you'd have a fit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You
mentioned the very spot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you said so at the examination yet?</q> Smerdyakov queried
with composure.
</p>

<p>
Ivan felt suddenly angry.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a
great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let
you play with me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you,
as in God Almighty?</q> said Smerdyakov, with the same composure,
only for a moment closing his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the first place,</q> began Ivan, <q>I know that epileptic fits can't
be told beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in.
You can't foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me
the day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How
could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit,
if you didn't sham a fit on purpose?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,</q>
Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. <q>I fell from the garret just in
<pb n='685'/><anchor id='Pg685'/>
the same way a year ago. It's quite true you can't tell the day and
hour of a fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment
of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you did foretell the day and the hour!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the
doctors here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham;
it's no use my saying any more about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the
cellar?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going
down to the cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened
me most was losing you and being left without defense in all
the world. So I went down into the cellar thinking, <q>Here, it'll
come on directly, it'll strike me down directly, shall I fall?</q> And
it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always
comes ... and so I went flying. All that and all my previous
conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when I told
you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that
to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating
lawyer, and it's all been written down in the protocol. And the
doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was
just the thought of it brought it on, the apprehension that I might
fall. It was just then that the fit seized me. And so they've written
it down, that it's just how it must have happened, simply from
my fear.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you have said all that in your evidence?</q> said Ivan, somewhat
taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat
of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov
had already reported it all himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole
truth,</q> Smerdyakov pronounced firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And have you told them every word of our conversation at the
gate?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not to say every word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted
then?</q>
</p>

<pb n='686'/><anchor id='Pg686'/>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't tell them that either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was afraid you'd go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer,
anyway.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told
me to get out of the way of trouble.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,
foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to
spare myself even more. That's why I told you to get out of
harm's way, that you might understand that there would be trouble
in the house, and would remain at home to protect your father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!</q> Ivan
suddenly fired up.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my
fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I
might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would
make a scene and carry away that money, for he considered it as
good as his own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder
like this? I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand
that lay under the master's mattress in the envelope, and you
see, he's murdered him. How could you guess it either, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could
I have guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!</q>
said Ivan, pondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya
and not to Moscow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I guess it from that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for
a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to
go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you
nearer, for Moscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
knowing you are not far off, would not be so bold. And if anything
had happened, you might have come to protect me, too, for
I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch's illness, and that I was
afraid of having a fit. And when I explained those knocks to you,
by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that Dmitri
Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would
<pb n='687'/><anchor id='Pg687'/>
guess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so
wouldn't go to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He talks very coherently,</q> thought Ivan, <q>though he does mumble;
what's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube
talked of?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are cunning with me, damn you!</q> he exclaimed, getting
angry.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,</q> Smerdyakov
parried with the simplest air.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I'd guessed, I should have stayed,</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went
away in such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away
and save yourself in your fright.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, I thought you were like me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I ought to have guessed,</q> Ivan said in agitation; <q>and
I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only
you are lying, you are lying again,</q> he cried, suddenly recollecting.
<q>Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me,
<q>It's always worth while speaking to a clever man</q>? So you were
glad I went away, since you praised me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into
his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I was pleased,</q> he articulated rather breathlessly, <q>it was
simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya.
For it was nearer, anyway. Only when I said these
words to you, it was not by way of praise, but of reproach. You
didn't understand it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What reproach?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own
father, and would not protect us, for I might have been taken up
any time for stealing that three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn you!</q> Ivan swore again. <q>Stay, did you tell the prosecutor
and the investigating lawyer about those knocks?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I told them everything just as it was.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan wondered inwardly again.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I thought of anything then,</q> he began again, <q>it was solely
of some wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that
he would steal&mdash;I did not believe that then.... But I was prepared
<pb n='688'/><anchor id='Pg688'/>
for any wickedness from you. You told me yourself you
could sham a fit. What did you say that for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a
fit on purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you.
It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted
with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What else is left for him to do?</q> said Smerdyakov, with a bitter
grin. <q>And who will believe him with all the proofs against him?
Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after
that? But never mind him! He is trembling to save himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection,
added:
</p>

<p>
<q>And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make
out that it is the work of my hands&mdash;I've heard that already. But
as to my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand
that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design
against your father? If I had been planning such a murder could
I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself
beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely?
As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one
hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you
were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you
might defend me completely by doing so, for who would be likely
to be such a criminal, if he is so open-hearted beforehand? Any
one can see that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck
by Smerdyakov's last argument. <q>I don't suspect you at all, and I
think it's absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am
grateful to you for setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but
I'll come again. Meanwhile, good-by. Get well. Is there anything
you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not
forget me, and provides me anything I want, according to her kindness.
Good people visit me every day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by. But I shan't say anything of your being able to
sham a fit, and I don't advise you to, either,</q> something made Ivan
say suddenly.
</p>

<pb n='689'/><anchor id='Pg689'/>

<p>
<q>I quite understand. And if you don't speak of that, I shall say
nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had
gone a dozen steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there
was an insulting significance in Smerdyakov's last words. He was
almost on the point of turning back, but it was only a passing
impulse, and muttering, <q>Nonsense!</q> he went out of the hospital.
</p>

<p>
His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not
Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though
he might have been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want
to analyze the reason for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance
at prying into his sensations. He felt as though he wanted
to make haste to forget something. In the following days he became
convinced of Mitya's guilt, as he got to know all the weight
of evidence against him. There was evidence of people of no importance,
Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it
was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern,
and at Plotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their
evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning.
The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as
much as Grigory's evidence as to the open door. Grigory's wife,
Marfa, in answer to Ivan's questions, declared that Smerdyakov
had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. <q>He
was not three paces from our bed,</q> and that although she was a
sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, <q>He
was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.</q>
</p>

<p>
Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov
was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from
the old man a subtle smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know how he spends his time now?</q> he asked; <q>learning
lists of French words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his
pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him
by some one, he he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of
Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however.
Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that <q>in all
probability</q> Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha's
opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it
<pb n='690'/><anchor id='Pg690'/>
now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not
make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never
began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too,
struck Ivan particularly.
</p>

<p>
But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something
quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned
himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina
Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion
of Ivan's, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would
furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never
write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving
Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I've related already, told
him, <q>I am not keen on her,</q> it was an absolute lie: he loved her
madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered
her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered
by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan's return
to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated
in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who
had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well),
and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own.
But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to
the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions
and the great fascination he had for her. She was continually
tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted Mitya,
and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they were numerous)
she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to
Alyosha <q>lies upon lies.</q> There was, of course, much that was false
in it, and that angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all
this later.
</p>

<p>
He did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov's existence,
and yet, a fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be
haunted by the same strange thoughts as before. It's enough to say
that he was continually asking himself, why was it that on that
last night in Fyodor Pavlovitch's house he had crept out on to the
stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his father was doing
below? Why had he recalled that afterwards with repulsion? Why
next morning, had he been suddenly so depressed on the journey?
Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to himself, <q>I am a scoundrel</q>?
<pb n='691'/><anchor id='Pg691'/>
And now he almost fancied that these tormenting thoughts
would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so completely did
they take possession of him again. It was just after fancying this,
that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once, and put
a question to him:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat
father, and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved <q>the
right to desire</q>?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired
father's death or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did think so,</q> answered Alyosha, softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn't you
fancy then that what I wished was just that <q>one reptile should
devour another</q>; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as
soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help
to bring that about?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother's
face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak!</q> cried Ivan, <q>I want above everything to know what
you thought then. I want the truth, the truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his
answer came.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,</q> whispered
Alyosha, and he did not add one softening phrase.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks,</q> snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly
on his way. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously
to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to
him, so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately
after that meeting with him, Ivan had not gone home, but
went straight to Smerdyakov again.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital.
Ivan knew his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house,
divided in two by a passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna
<pb n='692'/><anchor id='Pg692'/>
and her mother, and on the other, Smerdyakov. No one
knew on what terms he lived with them, whether as a friend or as
a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with
them as Marya Kondratyevna's betrothed, and was living there for
a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and
daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as
greatly superior to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into
the passage. By Marya Kondratyevna's directions he went straight
to the better room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was
a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot. The walls were
gay with blue paper, which was a good deal used however, and in
the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers, so
that there was a continual rustling from them. The furniture was
very scanty: two benches against each wall and two chairs by the
table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink
patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two
little windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the
table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a
tray with two cups. But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the
samovar was out. He was sitting at the table on a bench. He was
looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen. There
was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick, but with a
composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov's face that he
had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,
fuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down
at the sides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown,
rather dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his
nose, which Ivan had never seen him wearing before. This trifling
circumstance suddenly redoubled Ivan's anger: <q>A creature like that
and wearing spectacles!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his
visitor through his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and
rose from the bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily,
doing the least possible required by common civility. All this struck
Ivan instantly; he took it all in and noted it at once&mdash;most of all
the look in Smerdyakov's eyes, positively malicious, churlish and
haughty. <q>What do you want to intrude for?</q> it seemed to say;
<pb n='693'/><anchor id='Pg693'/>
<q>we settled everything then; why have you come again?</q> Ivan
could scarcely control himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's hot here,</q> he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take off your coat,</q> Smerdyakov conceded.
</p>

<p>
Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling
hands. He took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down.
Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>To begin with, are we alone?</q> Ivan asked sternly and impulsively.
<q>Can they overhear us in there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a
passage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was
leaving the hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of
shamming fits, you wouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our
conversation at the gate? What do you mean by <emph>all</emph>? What could
you mean by it? Were you threatening me? Have I entered into
some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am afraid of
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with
obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and
meant to show his cards. Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully,
his left eye winked, and he at once gave his answer, with his habitual
composure and deliberation. <q>You want to have everything above-board;
very well, you shall have it,</q> he seemed to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you,
knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him
to his fate, and that people mightn't after that conclude any evil
about your feelings and perhaps of something else, too&mdash;that's what
I promised not to tell the authorities.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling
himself, yet there was something in his voice, determined and
emphatic, resentful and insolently defiant. He stared impudently
at Ivan. A mist passed before Ivan's eyes for the first moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>How? What? Are you out of your mind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you suppose I <emph>knew</emph> of the murder?</q> Ivan cried at last, and
<pb n='694'/><anchor id='Pg694'/>
he brought his fist violently on the table. <q>What do you mean by
<q>something else, too</q>? Speak, scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent
stare.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that <q>something else, too</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The <q>something else</q> I meant was that you probably, too, were
very desirous of your parent's death.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder,
so that he fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was
bathed in tears. Saying, <q>It's a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,</q>
he dried his eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank
into quiet weeping. A minute passed.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough! Leave off,</q> Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down
again. <q>Don't put me out of all patience.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered
face reflected the insult he had just received.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri
I meant to kill my father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I didn't know what thoughts were in your mind then,</q> said
Smerdyakov resentfully; <q>and so I stopped you then at the gate to
sound you on that very point.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To sound what, what?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father
to be murdered or not.</q>
</p>

<p>
What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive,
insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was you murdered him?</q> he cried suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't I murdered him.
And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible
man to speak of it again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in
such a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I
resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same
as your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I
should be crushed like a fly, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago.</q>
</p>

<pb n='695'/><anchor id='Pg695'/>

<p>
<q>I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I
thought you'd understand without wasting words, and that being
such a sensible man you wouldn't care to talk of it openly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ...
what could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your
mean soul?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't
want to, but as for wanting some one else to do it, that was just
what you did want.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have
wanted it; what grounds had I for wanting it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?</q> said
Smerdyakov sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. <q>Why,
after your parent's death there was at least forty thousand to come
to each of you, and very likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got
married then to that lady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have
had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding, for
she's plenty of sense, so that your parent would not have left you
two roubles between the three of you. And were they far from a
wedding, either? Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only to lift
her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with
his tongue out.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very good,</q> he commented at last. <q>You see, I haven't jumped
up, I haven't knocked you down, I haven't killed you. Speak on.
So, according to you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning
on him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then
he would lose all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property,
and would go off to exile; so his share of the inheritance would come
to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so
you'd each have not forty, but sixty thousand each. There's not a
doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had
reckoned on any one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri,
and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you ... at the
time.... I remember my impression!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning
<pb n='696'/><anchor id='Pg696'/>
on me as well,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. <q>So that
it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was
in your mind. For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went
away, you as good as said to me, <q>You can murder my parent, I
won't hinder you!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You scoundrel! So that's how you understood it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were
meaning to go to Moscow and refused all your father's entreaties to
go to Tchermashnya&mdash;and simply at a foolish word from me you
consented at once! What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya?
Since you went to Tchermashnya with no reason, simply
at my word, it shows that you must have expected something
from me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I swear I didn't!</q> shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.
</p>

<p>
<q>You didn't? Then you ought, as your father's son, to have had
me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ...
or at least, to have given me a punch in the face on the spot,
but you were not a bit angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly
way acted on my foolish word and went away, which was utterly
absurd, for you ought to have stayed to save your parent's life. How
could I help drawing my conclusions?</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am sorry I didn't punch you in the face,</q> he said with a
bitter smile. <q>I couldn't have taken you to the lock-up just then.
Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against
you? But the punch in the face ... oh, I'm sorry I didn't think
of it. Though blows are forbidden, I should have pounded your
ugly face to a jelly.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the ordinary occasions of life,</q> he said in the same complacent
and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued
with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch's table, <q>in the ordinary
occasions of life, blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by
law, and people have given them up, but in exceptional occasions
of life people still fly to blows, not only among us but all over the
world, be it even the fullest Republic of France, just as in the time
of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave off, but you, even in an
exceptional case, did not dare.</q>
</p>

<pb n='697'/><anchor id='Pg697'/>

<p>
<q>What are you learning French words for?</q> Ivan nodded towards
the exercise-book lying on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why shouldn't I learn them so as to improve my education,
supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy
parts of Europe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, monster.</q> Ivan's eyes flashed and he trembled all over.
<q>I am not afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like
about me, and if I don't beat you to death, it's simply because I
suspect you of that crime and I'll drag you to justice. I'll unmask
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To my thinking, you'd better keep quiet, for what can you
accuse me of, considering my absolute innocence? and who would
believe you? Only if you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I
must defend myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think I am afraid of you now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If the court doesn't believe all I've said to you just now, the
public will, and you will be ashamed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's as much as to say, <q>It's always worth while speaking to a
sensible man,</q> eh?</q> snarled Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You hit the mark, indeed. And you'd better be sensible.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat,
and without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking
at him, walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air
refreshed him. There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare
of ideas and sensations filled his soul. <q>Shall I go at once and give
information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give?
He is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he'll accuse me. And
in fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then? What for?
What for?</q> Ivan asked himself. <q>Yes, of course, I was expecting
something and he is right....</q> And he remembered for the hundredth
time how, on the last night in his father's house, he had
listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish
that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. <q>Yes,
I expected it then, that's true! I wanted the murder, I did want
the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must
kill Smerdyakov! If I don't dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not
worth living!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna
<pb n='698'/><anchor id='Pg698'/>
and alarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He
repeated all his conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it.
He couldn't be calmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he
kept walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly.
At last he sat down, put his elbows on the table, leaned his head on
his hands and pronounced this strange sentence: <q>If it's not Dmitri,
but Smerdyakov who's the murderer, I share his guilt, for I put him
up to it. Whether I did, I don't know yet. But if he is the murderer,
and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat
without a word, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing
on it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was
the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a <q>conclusive
proof</q> that Dmitri had killed his father. It was the letter
written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the
very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the
monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna's, when Grushenka
had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed
to Grushenka. I don't know whether he saw her, but in the evening
he was at the <q>Metropolis,</q> where he got thoroughly drunk. Then
he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences
to himself. It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a
drunken letter in fact. It was like the talk of a drunken man, who,
on his return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife
or one of his household how he has just been insulted, what a rascal
had just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the other hand,
and how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length,
with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows
on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary
paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern and
there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently
not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only
filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.
The letter ran as follows:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Fatal Katya</hi>: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your
three thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell,
too, my love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get
it from every one, and if I can't borrow it, I give you my word of
<pb n='699'/><anchor id='Pg699'/>
honor I shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money
from under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to
Siberia for it, I'll give you back your three thousand. And farewell.
I bow down to the ground before you, for I've been a scoundrel to
you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you'll be happier
and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love another
woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can you
forgive? I will murder the man who's robbed me! I'll leave you all
and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not <emph>her</emph> either, for you
are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!
</p>

<p>
P.S.&mdash;I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart.
One string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two!
I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three thousand
from him and fling it to you. Though I've been a scoundrel
to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand. The cur
keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a thief, but
I'll murder my thief. Katya, don't look disdainful. Dmitri is not a
thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father and ruined himself
to hold his ground, rather than endure your pride. And he
doesn't love you.
</p>

<p>
P.P.S.&mdash;I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.&mdash;Katya, pray to God
that some one'll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in
gore, and if no one does&mdash;I shall! Kill me!
</p>

<p>
Your slave and enemy,

<p>
When Ivan read this <q>document</q> he was convinced. So then it
was his brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then
not he, Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of
a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of
Mitya's guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way,
that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with
Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts.
Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only thought
of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later he
positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed
at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and
forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about
Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and
out of his mind.
</p>

<pb n='700'/><anchor id='Pg700'/>

<p>
<q>He'll end in madness,</q> the young doctor Varvinsky observed
about him, and Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that
month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the
Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just
before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina
Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in
love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna's <q>returns</q> to Mitya,
that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor, drove
Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene described
above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan
had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of
Mitya's guilt, in spite of those <q>returns</q> that were so hateful to him.
It is remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more
and more every day, he realized that it was not on account of
Katya's <q>returns</q> that he hated him, but just <emph>because he was the
murderer of his father</emph>. He was conscious of this and fully recognized
it to himself.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and
proposed to him a plan of escape&mdash;a plan he had obviously thought
over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place
still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov's, that it was to
his, Ivan's, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as that
would increase his inheritance and Alyosha's from forty to sixty
thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on
arranging Mitya's escape. On his return from seeing him, he was
very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was
anxious for Mitya's escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing
thirty thousand, but for another reason. <q>Is it because I am
as much a murderer at heart?</q> he asked himself. Something very
deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above
all suffered cruelly all that month. But of that later....
</p>

<p>
When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided
with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he
obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly
remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him
in Alyosha's presence: <q>It was you, you, persuaded me of his</q>
(that is, Mitya's) <q>guilt!</q> Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled
it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was
<pb n='701'/><anchor id='Pg701'/>
the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her
presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was
<emph>she</emph>, she, who had produced that <q>document</q> and proved his
brother's guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: <q>I've been at
Smerdyakov's myself!</q> When had she been there? Ivan had known
nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya's guilt! And
what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said
to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could not understand
how he could, half an hour before, have let those words pass
and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and
rushed off to Smerdyakov. <q>I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,</q>
he thought on the way.
</p>

<head>Chapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
When he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been
blowing early that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow
began falling thickly. It did not lie on the ground, but was
whirled about by the wind, and soon there was a regular snowstorm.
There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of the town where
Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness, unconscious
of the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His head ached
and there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that his
hands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevna's
cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken
little peasant. He was wearing a coarse and patched coat, and was
walking in zigzags, grumbling and swearing to himself. Then
suddenly he would begin singing in a husky drunken voice:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>I won't wait till he comes back.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing
again; then he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an
intense hatred for him before he had thought about him at all.
Suddenly he realized his presence and felt an irresistible impulse to
<pb n='702'/><anchor id='Pg702'/>
knock him down. At that moment they met, and the peasant with
a violent lurch fell full tilt against Ivan, who pushed him back
furiously. The peasant went flying backwards and fell like a log
on the frozen ground. He uttered one plaintive <q>O&mdash;oh!</q> and then
was silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He was lying on his back,
without movement or consciousness. <q>He will be frozen,</q> thought
Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakov's.
</p>

<p>
In the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the
door with a candle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was
very ill, <q>It's not that he's laid up, but he seems not himself, and
he even told us to take the tea away; he wouldn't have any.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, does he make a row?</q> asked Ivan coarsely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he's very quiet. Only please
don't talk to him too long,</q> Marya Kondratyevna begged him.
Ivan opened the door and stepped into the room.
</p>

<p>
It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room.
One of the benches at the side had been removed, and in its place
had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed
had been made up, with fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov
was sitting on the sofa, wearing the same dressing-gown. The table
had been brought out in front of the sofa, so that there was hardly
room to move. On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover, but
Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be sitting doing nothing.
He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was apparently not
at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in his
face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and
there were blue marks under them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you really are ill?</q> Ivan stopped short. <q>I won't keep
you long, I won't even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?</q>
</p>

<p>
He went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and
sat down on it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you look at me without speaking? I've only come with
one question, and I swear I won't go without an answer. Has the
young lady, Katerina Ivanovna, been with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.
Suddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with you?</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>

<q>What do you mean by <q>nothing</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, she has. It's no matter to you. Let me alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I won't let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I'd quite forgotten about her,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a
scornful smile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him
with a look of frenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on
him at their last interview, a month before.
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don't look
like yourself,</q> he said to Ivan.
