
<p>
<q>Never mind. If you won't have it, we will,</q> said Fyodor Pavlovitch,
beaming. <q>But stay&mdash;have you dined?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece
of bread and drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior's kitchen.
<q>Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo, my darling! He'll have some coffee. Does it want
warming? No, it's boiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's making.
My Smerdyakov's an artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at
fish soup, too. You must come one day and have some fish soup.
Let me know beforehand.... But, stay; didn't I tell you this
morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all?
Have you brought your mattress? He he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I haven't,</q> said Alyosha, smiling, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning,
weren't you? There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex
you. Do you know, Ivan, I can't resist the way he looks one straight
in the face and laughs? It makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>
of him. Alyosha, let me give you my blessing&mdash;a father's blessing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his
mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no,</q> he said. <q>I'll just make the sign of the cross over you,
for now. Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own line,
too. It'll make you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to us
here&mdash;and how he talks! How he talks!</q>
</p>

<p>
Balaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a
young man of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and
taciturn. Not that he was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he
was conceited and seemed to despise everybody.
</p>

<p>
But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was
brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up <q>with no
sense of gratitude,</q> as Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly
boy, and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully. In his childhood
he was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with
great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were
a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead cat as
though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the greatest
secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a
sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a
week. <q>He doesn't care for you or me, the monster,</q> Grigory used
to say to Marfa, <q>and he doesn't care for any one. Are you a human
being?</q> he said, addressing the boy directly. <q>You're not a
human being. You grew from the mildew in the bath-house.<note place='foot'>A
proverbial expression in Russia.</note>
That's what you are.</q> Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could
never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to read and
write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the
Scriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or
third lesson the boy suddenly grinned.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that for?</q> asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly
from under his spectacles.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun,
moon, and stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from
on the first day?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his
teacher. There was something positively condescending in his expression.
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>
Grigory could not restrain himself. <q>I'll show you
where!</q> he cried, and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek. The
boy took the slap without a word, but withdrew into his corner
again for some days. A week later he had his first attack of the
disease to which he was subject all the rest of his life&mdash;epilepsy.
When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy seemed
changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though
he never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met
him. Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the
boy something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his
illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and
tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The fits
occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals.
The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very
severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal
punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to come upstairs
to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a
time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch
noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles
through the glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books&mdash;over
a hundred&mdash;but no one ever saw him reading. He at once
gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. <q>Come, read. You
shall be my librarian. You'll be better sitting reading than hanging
about the courtyard. Come, read this,</q> and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave
him <hi rend='italic'>Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka</hi>.
</p>

<p>
He read a little but didn't like it. He did not once smile, and
ended by frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? Isn't it funny?</q> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov did not speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>Answer, stupid!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all untrue,</q> mumbled the boy, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay,
here's Smaragdov's <hi rend='italic'>Universal History</hi>. That's all true. Read
that.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov.
He thought it dull. So the bookcase was closed again.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch
that Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary
fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>
spoon and look into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a
spoonful and hold it to the light.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it? A beetle?</q> Grigory would ask.
</p>

<p>
<q>A fly, perhaps,</q> observed Marfa.
</p>

<p>
The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with
his bread, his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece
on his fork to the light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after
long deliberation decide to put it in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs!</q> Grigory muttered, looking
at him.
</p>

<p>
When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov
he determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow
to be trained. He spent some years there and came back remarkably
changed in appearance. He looked extraordinarily old for his
age. His face had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate.
In character he seemed almost exactly the same as before he
went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not the slightest
inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard
afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little interest
for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice
of anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and
displeased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from
Moscow well dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed
his clothes most scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very
fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special English polish,
so that they shone like mirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook.
Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the whole of which
Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things.
But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for
men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor
Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were becoming
more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked,
which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are your fits getting worse?</q> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch,
looking askance at his new cook. <q>Would you like to get married?
Shall I find you a wife?</q>
</p>

<p>
But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply.
Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>
thing was that he had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened
once, when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in
the muddy courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he had only
just received. He only missed them next day, and was just hastening
to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table.
Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked them up and
brought them in the day before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
said shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he
not only believed in his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking
for him, although the young man looked as morosely at him as at
every one and was always silent. He rarely spoke. If it had occurred
to any one to wonder at the time what the young man was
interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have been impossible
to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop
suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand
still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his
face would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection,
but only a sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by
the painter Kramskoy, called <q>Contemplation.</q> There is a forest in
winter, and on a roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude,
stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it
were, lost in thought. Yet he is not thinking; he is <q>contemplating.</q>
If any one touched him he would start and look at one as
though awakening and bewildered. It's true he would come to
himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been thinking
about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden
within himself, the impression which had dominated him during
the period of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and
no doubt he hoards them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously.
How and why, of course, he does not know either. He may suddenly,
after hoarding impressions for many years, abandon everything
and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his soul's salvation,
or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native village, and perhaps
do both. There are a good many <q>contemplatives</q> among the
peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he
probably was greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing
why.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. The Controversy</head>

<p>
But Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a
strange one. Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases,
and had heard from the shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of
a Russian soldier which had appeared in the newspaper of that day.
This soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia,
and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death if he did
not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny
his faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and
glorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor
Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and
talk, if only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly
good-humored and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening
to the story, he observed that they ought to make a saint of a
soldier like that, and to take his skin to some monastery. <q>That
would make the people flock, and bring the money in.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means
touched, but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment
Smerdyakov, who was standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov
often waited at table towards the end of dinner, and since Ivan's
arrival in our town he had done so every day.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you grinning at?</q> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching
the smile instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, my opinion is,</q> Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly
in a loud voice, <q>that if that laudable soldier's exploit was
so very great there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it
if he had on such an emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of
Christ and his own christening, to save by that same his life, for
good deeds, by which, in the course of years to expiate his cowardice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that
you'll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,</q> put in
Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>

<p>
It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch,
as we have seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.
</p>

<p>
<q>We're on your subject, your subject,</q> he chuckled gleefully,
making Alyosha sit down to listen.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for
this, and there shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,</q>
Smerdyakov maintained stoutly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean <q>according to justice</q>?</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cried still more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a rascal, that's what he is!</q> burst from Grigory. He looked
Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,</q>
answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure. <q>You'd better consider
yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the
Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God
and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by
my own reason, since there would be no sin in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,</q>
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Soup-maker!</q> muttered Grigory contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for
yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as
I say to those enemies, <q>No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my
true God,</q> then at once, by God's high judgment, I become immediately
and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the
Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that
very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying
it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off. Is that
so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was
really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware
of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the
questions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, <q>stoop down for me
to whisper. He's got this all up for your benefit. He wants you
to praise him. Praise him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his father's excited
whisper.
</p>

<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>

<p>
<q>Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch
once more. <q>Ivan, your ear again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.
</p>

<p>
<q>I love you as I do Alyosha. Don't think I don't love you. Some
brandy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.&mdash;But you're rather drunk yourself,</q> thought Ivan, looking
steadily at his father.
</p>

<p>
He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're anathema accursed, as it is,</q> Grigory suddenly burst
out, <q>and how dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't scold him, Grigory, don't scold him,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cut him short.
</p>

<p>
<q>You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time,
and listen, for I haven't finished all I had to say. For at the very
moment I become accursed, at that same highest moment, I become
exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes
of no avail. Isn't that so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste and finish, my boy,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him,
sipping from his wine-glass with relish.
</p>

<p>
<q>And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the
enemy when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian,
seeing I had already been relieved by God Himself of my
Christianity by reason of the thought alone, before I had time to
utter a word to the enemy. And if I have already been discharged,
in what manner and with what sort of justice can I be held responsible
as a Christian in the other world for having denied Christ, when,
through the very thought alone, before denying Him I had been
relieved from my christening? If I'm no longer a Christian, then
I can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to renounce. Who
will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even
in heaven, for not having been born a Christian? And who would
punish him for that, considering that you can't take two skins off
one ox? For God Almighty Himself, even if He did make the
Tatar responsible, when he dies would give him the smallest possible
punishment, I imagine (since he must be punished), judging that
he is not to blame if he has come into the world an unclean heathen,
from heathen parents. The Lord God can't surely take a Tatar and
say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>
would tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth
tell a lie, even in one word?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes
nearly starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand
what was said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and
stood, looking like a man who has just hit his head against a wall.
Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his glass and went off into his shrill
laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist!
He must have been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh,
you stinking Jesuit, who taught you? But you're talking nonsense,
you casuist, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don't cry, Grigory, we'll
reduce him to smoke and ashes in a moment. Tell me this, O ass;
you may be right before your enemies, but you have renounced your
faith all the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in
that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once you're
anathema they won't pat you on the head for it in hell. What do
you say to that, my fine Jesuit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart,
but there was no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the
most ordinary.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How's that the most ordinary?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You lie, accursed one!</q> hissed Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,</q> Smerdyakov went on,
staid and unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous
to the vanquished foe. <q>Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch;
it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a
mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move
without the least delay at your bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
if I'm without faith and you have so great a faith that you
are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain,
not to move into the sea for that's a long way off, but even
to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden.
You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will remain just
where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory
Vassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper manner, and only
abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one
in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea&mdash;except
perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and
they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the
Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them&mdash;if so it be, if all the
rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population
of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert,
and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them?
And so I'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall
be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. <q>So
you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan,
make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all
over!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the people's
faith,</q> Ivan assented, with an approving smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't it,
Alyosha? That's the Russian faith all over, isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,</q> said Alyosha
firmly and gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert,
only that idea. Surely that's Russian, isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that's purely Russian,</q> said Alyosha smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to you
to-day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only
from carelessness, because we haven't time; things are too much for
us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time,
only twenty-four hours in the day, so that one hasn't even time to
get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's sins. While you have
denied your faith to your enemies when you'd nothing else to think
about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes
a sin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had
believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really
would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith,
and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course,
it wouldn't have come to torture then, because I should only have
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>
had to say at that instant to the mountain, <q>Move and crush the
tormentor,</q> and it would have moved and at the very instant have
crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have walked away as
though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God. But,
suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that
mountain, <q>Crush these tormentors,</q> and it hadn't crushed them,
how could I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such
a dread hour of mortal terror? And apart from that, I should know
already that I could not attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of
Heaven (for since the mountain had not moved at my word, they
could not think very much of my faith up aloft, and there could
be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come). So
why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no good
purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my
back, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or
at my cry. And at such a moment not only doubt might come over
one but one might lose one's reason from fear, so that one would
not be able to think at all. And, therefore, how should I be particularly
to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or
here, I should, at least, save my skin. And so trusting fully in the
grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be altogether
forgiven.</q>

<head>Chapter VIII. Over The Brandy</head>

<p>
The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
who had been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He
frowned and gulped brandy, and it was already a glass too much.
</p>

<p>
<q>Get along with you, Jesuits!</q> he cried to the servants. <q>Go
away, Smerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day,
but be off! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She'll comfort
you and put you to bed. The rascals won't let us sit in peace after
dinner,</q> he snapped peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew
at his word.
</p>

<p>
<q>Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It's
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>
you he's so interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?</q>
he added to Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing whatever,</q> answered Ivan. <q>He's pleased to have a
high opinion of me; he's a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material
for revolution, however, when the time comes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For revolution?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There will be others and better ones. But there will be some
like him as well. His kind will come first, and better ones after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when will the time come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants
are not very fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, brother, but a Balaam's ass like that thinks and thinks, and
the devil knows where he gets to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's storing up ideas,</q> said Ivan, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, I know he can't bear me, nor any one else, even you,
though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still
with Alyosha, he despises Alyosha. But he doesn't steal, that's one
thing, and he's not a gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn't wash
our dirty linen in public. He makes capital fish pasties too. But,
damn him, is he worth talking about so much?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course he isn't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant,
generally speaking, needs thrashing. That I've always maintained.
Our peasants are swindlers, and don't deserve to be pitied, and it's
a good thing they're still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in
birches. If they destroyed the forests, it would be the ruin of Russia.
I stand up for the clever people. We've left off thrashing the
peasants, we've grown so clever, but they go on thrashing themselves.
And a good thing too. <q>For with what measure ye mete
it shall be measured to you again,</q> or how does it go? Anyhow, it
will be measured. But Russia's all swinishness. My dear, if you
only knew how I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this
vice! But maybe I mean Russia. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Tout
cela c'est de la cochonnerie</foreign>....
Do you know what I like? I like wit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've had another glass. That's enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a bit. I'll have one more, and then another, and then I'll
stop. No, stay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to
an old man, and he told me: <q>There's nothing we like so much as
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>
sentencing girls to be thrashed, and we always give the lads the job
of thrashing them. And the girl he has thrashed to-day, the young
man will ask in marriage to-morrow. So it quite suits the girls,
too,</q> he said. There's a set of de Sades for you! But it's clever,
anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh? Alyosha, are
you blushing? Don't be bashful, child. I'm sorry I didn't stay to
dinner at the Superior's and tell the monks about the girls at
Mokroe. Alyosha, don't be angry that I offended your Superior this
morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then,
of course, I'm to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if
there isn't a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It's
not enough to cut their heads off, for they keep back progress.
Would you believe it, Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No,
you don't believe it as I see from your eyes. You believe what people
say, that I'm nothing but a buffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that
I'm nothing but a buffoon?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I believe you don't, and that you speak the truth. You
look sincere and you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan's supercilious....
I'd make an end of your monks, though, all the same.
I'd take all that mystic stuff and suppress it, once for all, all over
Russia, so as to bring all the fools to reason. And the gold and the
silver that would flow into the mint!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why suppress it?</q> asked Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>That Truth may prevail. That's why.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you'd be the first to
be robbed and suppressed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! I dare say you're right. Ah, I'm an ass!</q> burst out Fyodor
Pavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. <q>Well, your
monastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that's how it is. And we
clever people will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan,
it must have been so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan,
speak, is there a God or not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously.
Why are you laughing again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm laughing that you should have made a clever remark just
now about Smerdyakov's belief in the existence of two saints who
could move mountains.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, am I like him now, then?</q>
</p>

<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>

<p>
<q>Very much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that shows I'm a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.
And you may be caught in the same way, though you
are a philosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I'll
catch you to-morrow. Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not?
Only, be serious. I want you to be serious now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there is no God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, is there a God?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a
tiny bit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no immortality either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None at all?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?
Anything is better than nothing!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Absolute nothingness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, is there immortality?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God and immortality?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God and immortality. In God is immortality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>H'm! It's more likely Ivan's right. Good Lord! to think what
faith, what force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that
dream, and for how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at
man? Ivan! For the last time, once for all, is there a God or not?
I ask for the last time!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And for the last time there is not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be the devil,</q> said Ivan, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the devil? Does he exist?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there's no devil either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn't I do to the man who
first invented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too
good for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There would have been no civilization if they hadn't invented
God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wouldn't there have been? Without God?</q>
</p>

<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>

<p>
<q>No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must
take your brandy away from you, anyway.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I've hurt
Alyosha's feelings. You're not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear
little Alexey!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better
than your head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that
from you. Ivan, do you love Alyosha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You must love him</q> (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very
drunk). <q>Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning.
But I was excited. But there's wit in that elder, don't you think,
Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very likely.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is, there is. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Il y a du Piron
là-dedans.</foreign> He's a Jesuit, a
Russian one, that is. As he's an honorable person there's a hidden
indignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, of course, he believes in God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bit of it. Didn't you know? Why, he tells every one
so, himself. That is, not every one, but all the clever people who
come to him. He said straight out to Governor Schultz not long
ago: <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Credo</foreign>, but I don't know in
what.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He really did. But I respect him. There's something of
Mephistopheles about him, or rather of <q>The hero of our time</q> ...
Arbenin, or what's his name?... You see, he's a sensualist. He's
such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my
wife if she went to confess to him. You know, when he begins telling
stories.... The year before last he invited us to tea, tea with
liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began telling us about
old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially how he once
cured a paralyzed woman. <q>If my legs were not bad I know a
dance I could dance you,</q> he said. What do you say to that? <q>I've
plenty of tricks in my time,</q> said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant,
out of sixty thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, he stole it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>

<p>
<q>He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying,
<q>Take care of it for me, friend, there'll be a police search at my
place to-morrow.</q> And he kept it. <q>You have given it to the
Church,</q> he declared. I said to him: <q>You're a scoundrel,</q> I said.
<q>No,</q> said he, <q>I'm not a scoundrel, but I'm broad-minded.</q> But that
wasn't he, that was some one else. I've muddled him with some
one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass and that's
enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I've been telling lies. Why
didn't you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I knew you'd stop of yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me.
You despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own
house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I'm going away. You've had too much brandy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've begged you for Christ's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a
day or two, and you don't go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll go to-morrow if you're so set upon it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't go. You want to keep an eye on me. That's what
you want, spiteful fellow. That's why you won't go.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness
when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to
pick a quarrel and to assert himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that?
Your eyes look at me and say, <q>You ugly drunkard!</q> Your eyes
are mistrustful. They're contemptuous.... You've come here
with some design. Alyosha, here, looks at me and his eyes shine.
Alyosha doesn't despise me. Alexey, you mustn't love Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking
him,</q> Alyosha said emphatically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy,
Ivan. It's the third time I've told you.</q>
</p>

<p>
He mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his
face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don't
love me, but don't be angry all the same. You've nothing to love
me for. You go to Tchermashnya. I'll come to you myself and
bring you a present. I'll show you a little wench there. I've had
my eye on her a long time. She's still running about bare-foot.
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
Don't be afraid of bare-footed wenches&mdash;don't despise them&mdash;they're
pearls!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he kissed his hand with a smack.
</p>

<p>
<q>To my thinking,</q> he revived at once, seeming to grow sober
the instant he touched on his favorite topic. <q>To my thinking ...
Ah, you boys! You children, little sucking-pigs, to my
thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life&mdash;that's
been my rule! Can you understand that? How could you understand
it? You've milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of
your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something
devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find
in any other. Only, one must know how to find it, that's the point!
That's a talent! To my mind there are no ugly women. The very
fact that she is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you
understand that? Even in <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>vieilles
filles</foreign>, even in them you may discover
something that makes you simply wonder that men have been
such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them. Bare-footed
girls or unattractive ones, you must take by surprise. Didn't
you know that? You must astound them till they're fascinated,
upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a
little slut. It's a jolly good thing that there always are and will
be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little
maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that's all that's
needed for happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to
surprise your mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention
to her at all, but all at once, when the minute came, I'd be all devotion
to her, crawl on my knees, kiss her feet, and I always, always&mdash;I
remember it as though it were to-day&mdash;reduced her to that
tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh. It was peculiar to her.
I knew her attacks always used to begin like that. The next day
she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh was not
a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That's
the great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky&mdash;he
was a handsome fellow, and rich&mdash;used to like to come here
and hang about her&mdash;suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her
presence. And she&mdash;such a mild sheep&mdash;why, I thought she would
have knocked me down for that blow. How she set on me! <q>You're
beaten, beaten now,</q> she said. <q>You've taken a blow from him.
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
You have been trying to sell me to him,</q> she said.... <q>And how
dared he strike you in my presence! Don't dare come near me
again, never, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!</q>...
I took her to the monastery then to bring her to her senses. The
holy Fathers prayed her back to reason. But I swear, by God,
Alyosha, I never insulted the poor crazy girl! Only once, perhaps,
in the first year; then she was very fond of praying. She used to
keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn me out
of her room then. I'll knock that mysticism out of her, thought I!
<q>Here,</q> said I, <q>you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it
down. You believe it's miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it directly
and nothing will happen to me for it!</q>... When she saw it, good
Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung
her hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all
over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha,
what's the matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun
speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over
Alyosha's face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips
quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing,
till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha.
Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly
repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his
mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in
them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical
paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance
to his mother particularly impressed the old man.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her, exactly as she used
to be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth,
that's what I used to do to her. He's upset about his mother, his
mother,</q> he muttered to Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she
not?</q> said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old
man shrank before his flashing eyes. But something very strange
had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have
escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's mother actually was the
mother of Ivan too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your mother?</q> he muttered, not understanding. <q>What do
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>
you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?...
Why, damn it! of course she was yours too! Damn it! My mind
has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why, I was thinking,
Ivan.... He he he!</q> He stopped. A broad, drunken, half-senseless
grin overspread his face.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the
hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri
burst into the room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Don't let him get at me!</q> he
screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan's coat.

<head>Chapter IX. The Sensualists</head>

<p>
Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri.
They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing
to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch
some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri
stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory
ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of
the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the
closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance,
so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,
Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then she's there! She's hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him
back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory
with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping
over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling
at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's here!</q> shouted Dmitri. <q>I saw her turn towards the house
just now, but I couldn't catch her. Where is she? Where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
That shout, <q>She's here!</q> produced an indescribable effect on
Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.
</p>

<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>

<p>
<q>Hold him! Hold him!</q> he cried, and dashed after Dmitri.
Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed
stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third
room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash:
it was a large glass vase&mdash;not an expensive one&mdash;on a marble pedestal
which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.
</p>

<p>
<q>At him!</q> shouted the old man. <q>Help!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing
him back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright,</q> Ivan
cried wrathfully at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He
said he saw her himself, running.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time,
and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.
He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come,</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>But she may have come by that other entrance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of
course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was
in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket. The windows of all the rooms
were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor
have run out anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold him!</q> shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him
again. <q>He's been stealing money in my bedroom.</q> And tearing
himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up
both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts
of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung
him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times
with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan,
though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and
with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his
slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madman! You've killed him!</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Serve him right!</q> shouted Dmitri breathlessly. <q>If I haven't
killed him, I'll come again and kill him. You can't protect him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri! Go away at once!</q> cried Alyosha commandingly.
</p>

<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>

<p>
<q>Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here
just now, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence
from the lane. I shouted, she ran away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I saw her.... So she must ... I'll find out at once
where she is.... Good-by, Alexey! Not a word to Æsop about
the money now. But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure
to say, <q>He sends his compliments to you!</q> Compliments, his compliments!
Just compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated
him in an arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was
conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still
fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri
looked at him with hatred as he went out.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't repent shedding your blood!</q> he cried. <q>Beware, old
man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you,
and disown you altogether.</q>
</p>

<p>
He ran out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!</q> the
old man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his
finger.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she's not here, you old lunatic!</q> Ivan shouted at him angrily.
<q>Here, he's fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed,
and put him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his
head. Exhausted by the brandy, by his violent emotion, and the
blows he had received, he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his
head touched the pillow. Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room.
Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase,
while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed,
too?</q> Alyosha said to him. <q>We'll look after him. My brother
gave you a terrible blow&mdash;on the head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's insulted me!</q> Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's <q>insulted</q> his father, not only you,</q> observed Ivan with a
forced smile.
</p>
