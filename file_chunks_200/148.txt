impatiently. Her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. "Good heavens,
he is going to begin again!"

"You are laughing, I think? Why do you keep laughing at me?" said
Hippolyte irritably to Evgenie Pavlovitch, who certainly was laughing.

"I only want to know, Mr. Hippolyte--excuse me, I forget your surname."

"Mr. Terentieff," said the prince.

"Oh yes, Mr. Terentieff. Thank you prince. I heard it just now, but had
forgotten it. I want to know, Mr. Terentieff, if what I have heard about
you is true. It seems you are convinced that if you could speak to the
people from a window for a quarter of an hour, you could make them all
adopt your views and follow you?"

"I may have said so," answered Hippolyte, as if trying to remember.
"Yes, I certainly said so," he continued with sudden animation, fixing
an unflinching glance on his questioner. "What of it?"

"Nothing. I was only seeking further information, to put the finishing
touch." Evgenie Pavlovitch was silent, but Hippolyte kept his eyes fixed
upon him, waiting impatiently for more.

"Well, have you finished?" said Lizabetha Prokofievna to Evgenie. "Make
haste, sir; it is time he went to bed. Have you more to say?" She was
very angry.

"Yes, I have a little more," said Evgenie Pavlovitch, with a smile. "It
seems to me that all you and your friends have said, Mr. Terentieff, and
all you have just put forward with such undeniable talent, may be summed
up in the triumph of right above all, independent of everything else, to
the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having discovered
what constitutes the right. I may be mistaken?"

"You are certainly mistaken; I do not even understand you. What else?"

Murmurs arose in the neighbourhood of Burdovsky and his companions;
Lebedeff's nephew protested under his breath.

"I have nearly finished," replied Evgenie Pavlovitch.

"I will only remark that from these premises one could conclude that
might is right--I mean the right of the clenched fist, and of personal
inclination. Indeed, the world has often come to that conclusion.
Prudhon upheld that might is right. In the American War some of the most
advanced Liberals took sides with the planters on the score that the
blacks were an inferior race to the whites, and that might was the right
of the white race."

"Well?"

"You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?"

"What then?"

"You are at least logical. I would only point out that from the right
of might, to the right of tigers and crocodiles, or even Daniloff and
Gorsky, is but a step."

"I know nothing about that; what else?"

Hippolyte was scarcely listening. He kept saying "well?" and "what else?"
mechanically, without the least curiosity, and by mere force of habit.

"Why, nothing else; that is all."

"However, I bear you no grudge," said Hippolyte suddenly, and, hardly
conscious of what he was doing, he held out his hand with a smile. The
gesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost gravity
he touched the hand that was offered him in token of forgiveness.

"I can but thank you," he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere,
"for your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that
our Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own,
and immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have
recourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature."

"What you say is quite true," observed General Epanchin; then, clasping
his hands behind his back, he returned to his place on the terrace
steps, where he yawned with an air of boredom.

"Come, sir, that will do; you weary me," said Lizabetha Prokofievna
suddenly to Evgenie Pavlovitch.

Hippolyte rose all at once, looking troubled and almost frightened.

"It is time for me to go," he said, glancing round in perplexity. "I
have detained you... I wanted to tell you everything... I thought you
all... for the last time... it was a whim..."

He evidently had sudden fits of returning animation, when he awoke
from his semi-delirium; then, recovering full self-possession for a
few moments, he would speak, in disconnected phrases which had perhaps
haunted him for a long while on his bed of suffering, during weary,
sleepless nights.

"Well, good-bye," he said abruptly. "You think it is easy for me to say
good-bye to you? Ha, ha!"

Feeling that his question was somewhat gauche, he smiled angrily. Then
as if vexed that he could not ever express what he really meant, he said
irritably, in a loud voice:

"Excellency, I have the honour of inviting you to my funeral; that is,
if you will deign to honour it with your presence. I invite you all,
gentlemen, as well as the general."

He burst out laughing again, but it was the laughter of a madman.
Lizabetha Prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm.
He stared at her for a moment, still laughing, but soon his face grew
serious.

"Do you know that I came here to see those trees?" pointing to the
trees in the park. "It is not ridiculous, is it? Say that it is not
ridiculous!" he demanded urgently of Lizabetha Prokofievna. Then he
seemed to be plunged in thought. A moment later he raised his head, and
his eyes sought for someone. He was looking for Evgenie Pavlovitch, who
was close by on his right as before, but he had forgotten this, and
his eyes ranged over the assembled company. "Ah! you have not gone!" he
said, when he caught sight of him at last. "You kept on laughing just
now, because I thought of speaking to the people from the window for a
quarter of an hour. But I am not eighteen, you know; lying on that bed,
and looking out of that window, I have thought of all sorts of things
for such a long time that... a dead man has no age, you know. I was
saying that to myself only last week, when I was awake in the night. Do
you know what you fear most? You fear our sincerity more than anything,
although you despise us! The idea crossed my mind that night... You
thought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha Prokofievna? No, the
idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to praise you. Colia
told me the prince called you a child--very well--but let me see, I had
something else to say..." He covered his face with his hands and tried
to collect his thoughts.

"Ah, yes--you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: 'I
shall never see these people again-never again! This is the last time
I shall see the trees, too. I shall see nothing after this but the red
brick wall of Meyer's house opposite my window. Tell them about it--try
to tell them,' I thought. 'Here is a beautiful young girl--you are a
dead man; make them understand that. Tell them that a dead man may
say anything--and Mrs. Grundy will not be angry--ha-ha! You are not
laughing?" He looked anxiously around. "But you know I get so many queer
ideas, lying there in bed. I have grown convinced that nature is full of
mockery--you called me an atheist just now, but you know this nature...
why are you laughing again? You are very cruel!" he added suddenly,
regarding them all with mournful reproach. "I have not corrupted Colia,"
he concluded in a different and very serious tone, as if remembering
something again.

"Nobody here is laughing at you. Calm yourself," said Lizabetha
Prokofievna, much moved. "You shall see a new doctor tomorrow; the
other was mistaken; but sit down, do not stand like that! You are
delirious--" Oh, what shall we do with him she cried in anguish, as she
made him sit down again in the arm-chair.

A tear glistened on her cheek. At the sight of it Hippolyte seemed
amazed. He lifted his hand timidly and, touched the tear with his
finger, smiling like a child.

"I... you," he began joyfully. "You cannot tell how I... he always spoke
so enthusiastically of you, Colia here; I liked his enthusiasm. I was
not corrupting him! But I must leave him, too--I wanted to leave
them all--there was not one of them--not one! I wanted to be a man of
action--I had a right to be. Oh! what a lot of things I wanted! Now I
want nothing; I renounce all my wants; I swore to myself that I would
want nothing; let them seek the truth without me! Yes, nature is full
of mockery! Why"--he continued with sudden warmth--"does she create
the choicest beings only to mock at them? The only human being who is
recognized as perfect, when nature showed him to mankind, was given the
mission to say things which have caused the shedding of so much blood
that it would have drowned mankind if it had all been shed at once! Oh!
it is better for me to die! I should tell some dreadful lie too; nature
would so contrive it! I have corrupted nobody. I wanted to live for the
happiness of all men, to find and spread the truth. I used to look out
of my window at the wall of Meyer's house, and say to myself that if I
could speak for a quarter of an hour I would convince the whole world,
and now for once in my life I have come into contact with... you--if
not with the others! And what is the result? Nothing! The sole result
is that you despise me! Therefore I must be a fool, I am useless, it is
time I disappeared! And I shall leave not even a memory! Not a sound,
not a trace, not a single deed! I have not spread a single truth!... Do
not laugh at the fool! Forget him! Forget him forever! I beseech you,
do not be so cruel as to remember! Do you know that if I were not
consumptive, I would kill myself?"

Though he seemed to wish to say much more, he became silent. He fell
back into his chair, and, covering his face with his hands, began to sob
like a little child.

"Oh! what on earth are we to do with him?" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.
She hastened to him and pressed his head against her bosom, while he
sobbed convulsively.

"Come, come, come! There, you must not cry, that will do. You are a good
child! God will forgive you, because you knew no better. Come now, be a
man! You know presently you will be ashamed."

Hippolyte raised his head with an effort, saying:

"I have little brothers and sisters, over there, poor avid innocent. She
will corrupt them! You are a saint! You are a child yourself--save them!
Snatch them from that... she is... it is shameful! Oh! help them! God
will repay you a hundredfold. For the love of God, for the love of
Christ!"

"Speak, Ivan Fedorovitch! What are we to do?" cried Lizabetha
Prokofievna, irritably. "Please break your majestic silence! I tell you,
if you cannot come to some decision, I will stay here all night myself.
You have tyrannized over me enough, you autocrat!"

She spoke angrily, and in great excitement, and expected an immediate
reply. But in such a case, no matter how many are present, all prefer
to keep silence: no one will take the initiative, but all reserve their
comments till afterwards. There were some present--Varvara Ardalionovna,
for instance--who would have willingly sat there till morning without
saying a word. Varvara had sat apart all the evening without opening her
lips, but she listened to everything with the closest attention; perhaps
she had her reasons for so doing.

"My dear," said the general, "it seems to me that a sick-nurse would be
of more use here than an excitable person like you. Perhaps it would be
as well to get some sober, reliable man for the night. In any case we
must consult the prince, and leave the patient to rest at once. Tomorrow
we can see what can be done for him."

"It is nearly midnight; we are going. Will he come with us, or is he to
stay here?" Doktorenko asked crossly of the prince.

"You can stay with him if you like," said Muishkin.

"There is plenty of room here."

Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Keller went quickly up to the
general.

"Excellency," he said, impulsively, "if you want a reliable man for the
night, I am ready to sacrifice myself for my friend--such a soul as he
has! I have long thought him a great man, excellency! My article showed
my lack of education, but when he criticizes he scatters pearls!"

Ivan Fedorovitch turned from the boxer with a gesture of despair.

"I shall be delighted if he will stay; it would certainly be difficult
for him to get back to Petersburg," said the prince, in answer to the
eager questions of Lizabetha Prokofievna.

"But you are half asleep, are you not? If you don't want him, I will
take him back to my house! Why, good gracious! He can hardly stand up
himself! What is it? Are you ill?"

Not finding the prince on his death-bed, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been
misled by his appearance to think him much better than he was. But his
recent illness, the painful memories attached to it, the fatigue of this
evening, the incident with "Pavlicheff's son," and now this scene with
Hippolyte, had all so worked on his oversensitive nature that he was now
almost in a fever. Moreover, anew trouble, almost a fear, showed itself
in his eyes; he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something
further.

Suddenly Hippolyte arose. His face, shockingly pale, was that of a man
overwhelmed with shame and despair. This was shown chiefly in the look
of fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the
wild smile upon his trembling lips. Then he cast down his eyes, and with
the same smile, staggered towards Burdovsky and Doktorenko, who stood at
the entrance to the verandah. He had decided to go with them.

"There! that is what I feared!" cried the prince. "It was inevitable!"

Hippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the
muscles of his face quivering.

"Ah! that is what you feared! It was inevitable, you say! Well, let me
tell you that if I hate anyone here--I hate you all," he cried, in a
hoarse, strained voice--"but you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your
soul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaire--I hate you
worse than anything or anyone on earth! I saw through you and hated you
long ago; from the day I first heard of you. I hated you with my whole
heart. You have contrived all this! You have driven me into this state!
You have made a dying man disgrace himself. You, you, you are the cause
of my abject cowardice! I would kill you if I remained alive! I do not
want your benefits; I will accept none from anyone; do you hear? Not
from any one! I want nothing! I was delirious, do not dare to triumph! I
curse every one of you, once for all!"

Breath failed him here, and he was obliged to stop.

"He is ashamed of his tears!" whispered Lebedeff to Lizabetha
Prokofievna. "It was inevitable. Ah! what a wonderful man the prince is!
He read his very soul."

But Mrs. Epanchin would not deign to look at Lebedeff. Drawn up
haughtily, with her head held high, she gazed at the "riff-raff,"
with scornful curiosity. When Hippolyte had finished, Ivan Fedorovitch
shrugged his shoulders, and his wife looked him angrily up and down, as
if to demand the meaning of his movement. Then she turned to the prince.

"Thanks, prince, many thanks, eccentric friend of the family, for the
pleasant evening you have provided for us. I am sure you are quite
pleased that you have managed to mix us up with your extraordinary
affairs. It is quite enough, dear family friend; thank you for giving us
an opportunity of getting to know you so well."

She arranged her cloak with hands that trembled with anger as she waited
for the "riff-raff" to go. The cab which Lebedeff's son had gone to
fetch a quarter of an hour ago, by Doktorenko's order, arrived at that
moment. The general thought fit to put in a word after his wife.

"Really, prince, I hardly expected after--after all our friendly
intercourse--and you see, Lizabetha Prokofievna--"

"Papa, how can you?" cried Adelaida, walking quickly up to the prince
and holding out her hand.

He smiled absently at her; then suddenly he felt a burning sensation in
his ear as an angry voice whispered:

"If you do not turn those dreadful people out of the house this very
instant, I shall hate you all my life--all my life!" It was Aglaya. She
seemed almost in a frenzy, but she turned away before the prince could
look at her. However, there was no one left to turn out of the house,
for they had managed meanwhile to get Hippolyte into the cab, and it had
driven off.

"Well, how much longer is this going to last, Ivan Fedorovitch? What do
you think? Shall I soon be delivered from these odious youths?"

"My dear, I am quite ready; naturally... the prince."

Ivan Fedorovitch held out his hand to Muishkin, but ran after his wife,
who was leaving with every sign of violent indignation, before he had
time to shake it. Adelaida, her fiance, and Alexandra, said good-bye to
their host with sincere friendliness. Evgenie Pavlovitch did the same,
and he alone seemed in good spirits.

"What I expected has happened! But I am sorry, you poor fellow, that
you should have had to suffer for it," he murmured, with a most charming
smile.

Aglaya left without saying good-bye. But the evening was not to end
without a last adventure. An unexpected meeting was yet in store for
Lizabetha Prokofievna.

She had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road
that skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart
open carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. Having passed
some ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one
of the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just
caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see.

"Evgenie Pavlovitch! Is that you?" cried a clear, sweet voice, which
caused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble. "Well, I AM
glad I've found you at last! I've sent to town for you twice today
myself! My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!"

Evgenie Pavlovitch stood on the steps like one struck by lightning.
Mrs. Epanchin stood still too, but not with the petrified expression of
Evgenie. She gazed haughtily at the audacious person who had addressed
her companion, and then turned a look of astonishment upon Evgenie
himself.

"There's news!" continued the clear voice. "You need not be anxious
about Kupferof's IOU's--Rogojin has bought them up. I persuaded him
to!--I dare say we shall settle Biscup too, so it's all right, you
see! Au revoir, tomorrow! And don't worry!" The carriage moved on, and
disappeared.

"The woman's mad!" cried Evgenie, at last, crimson with anger, and
looking confusedly around. "I don't know what she's talking about! What
IOU's? Who is she?" Mrs. Epanchin continued to watch his face for a
couple of seconds; then she marched briskly and haughtily away towards
her own house, the rest following her.

A minute afterwards, Evgenie Pavlovitch reappeared on the terrace, in
great agitation.

"Prince," he said, "tell me the truth; do you know what all this means?"

"I know nothing whatever about it!" replied the latter, who was,
himself, in a state of nervous excitement.

"No?"

"No?

"Well, nor do I!" said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing suddenly. "I haven't
the slightest knowledge of any such IOU's as she mentioned, I swear I
haven't--What's the matter, are you fainting?"

"Oh, no-no-I'm all right, I assure you!"

XI.

THE anger of the Epanchin family was unappeased for three days. As usual
the prince reproached himself, and had expected punishment, but he was
inwardly convinced that Lizabetha Prokofievna could not be seriously
angry with him, and that she probably was more angry with herself. He
was painfully surprised, therefore, when three days passed with no word
from her. Other things also troubled and perplexed him, and one of these
grew more important in his eyes as the days went by. He had begun to
blame himself for two opposite tendencies--on the one hand to extreme,
almost "senseless," confidence in his fellows, on the other to a "vile,
gloomy suspiciousness."

By the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and
Evgenie Pavlovitch had attained enormous and mysterious proportions in
his mind. He sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of
this new "monstrosity," or was it... but he refrained from saying who
else might be in fault. As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as
a harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischief--so childish that
he felt it would be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any
importance to it.

The day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the
honour of receiving a visit from Adelaida and her fiance, Prince S. They
came, ostensibly, to inquire after his health. They had wandered out for
a walk, and called in "by accident," and talked for almost the whole
of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree in the
park, which Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. This, and a
little amiable conversation on Prince S.'s part, occupied the time, and
not a word was said about last evening's episodes. At length Adelaida
burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had come
incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said nothing
about the prince's either walking back with them or coming to see them
later on, the latter inferred that he was in Mrs. Epanchin's black
books. Adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like to show
him, and explained that she would either send it by Colia, or bring it
herself the next day--which to the prince seemed very suggestive.

At length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of departing,
Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. "Oh yes, by-the-by," he
said, "do you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch, who that lady
was who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from the carriage?"

"It was Nastasia Philipovna," said the prince; "didn't you know that? I
cannot tell you who her companion was."

"But what on earth did she mean? I assure you it is a real riddle
to me--to me, and to others, too!" Prince S. seemed to be under the
influence of sincere astonishment.

"She spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitch's," said the prince,
simply, "which Rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that
Rogojin would not press him."

"Oh, I heard that much, my dear fellow! But the thing is so impossibly
absurd! A man of property like Evgenie to give IOU's to a money-lender,
and to be worried about them! It is ridiculous. Besides, he cannot
possibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave
us to understand; that's the principal part of the mystery! He has given
me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and of
course I believe him. Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know
anything about it? Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it come
across you?"

"No, I know nothing whatever about it. I assure you I had nothing at all
to do with it."

"Oh, prince, how strange you have become! I assure you, I hardly know
you for your old self. How can you suppose that I ever suggested you
could have had a finger in such a business? But you are not quite
yourself today, I can see." He embraced the prince, and kissed him.

"What do you mean, though," asked Muishkin, "'by such a business'? I
don't see any particular 'business' about it at all!"

"Oh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to
do Evgenie Pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to him--before
witnesses--qualities which he neither has nor can have," replied Prince
S. drily enough.

Muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and
questioningly into Prince S.'s face. The latter, however, remained
silent.

"Then it was not simply a matter of bills?" Muishkin said at last, with
some impatience. "It was not as she said?"

"But I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between
Evgenie Pavlovitch, and--her, and again Rogojin? I tell you he is a man
of immense wealth--as I know for a fact; and he has further expectations
from his uncle. Simply Nastasia Philipovna--"

Prince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about Nastasia
Philipovna.

"Then at all events he knows her!" remarked the prince, after a moment's
silence.

"Oh, that may be. He may have known her some time ago--two or three
years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that
there should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the
place--many people don't even know that she has returned from Moscow! I
have only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so."

"It's a lovely carriage," said Adelaida.

"Yes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!"

The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than
before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from
his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from
the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that
Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his
suspicions and justified his fears. It was all clear to him; Prince S.
was wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere near
the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to be
an intrigue of some sort going on. Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more
clearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand. At all events,
nothing could be plainer than that he and Adelaida had come for the
express purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him
of being concerned in the affair. And if all this were so, then SHE must
have some terrible object in view! What was it? There was no stopping
HER, as Muishkin knew from experience, in the performance of anything
she had set her mind on! "Oh, she is mad, mad!" thought the poor prince.

But there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required
immediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad. A visit from Vera
Lebedeff distracted him a little. She brought the infant Lubotchka with
her as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time. Then came her younger
sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by. He
informed Muishkin that his father had lately found a new interpretation
of the star called "wormwood," which fell upon the water-springs, as
described in the Apocalypse. He had decided that it meant the network of
railroads spread over the face of Europe at the present time. The
prince refused to believe that Lebedeff could have given such an
interpretation, and they decided to ask him about it at the earliest
opportunity. Vera related how Keller had taken up his abode with them on
the previous evening. She thought he would remain for some time, as he
was greatly pleased with the society of General Ivolgin and of the
whole family. But he declared that he had only come to them in order
to complete his education! The prince always enjoyed the company of
Lebedeff's children, and today it was especially welcome, for Colia did
not appear all day. Early that morning he had started for Petersburg.
Lebedeff also was away on business. But Gavrila Ardalionovitch had
promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his coming.

About seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. At the first
glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the
details of last night's affair. Indeed, it would have been impossible
for him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship
between him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin. But although he and the
prince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed
the Burdovsky affair in his hands-and this was not the only mark of
confidence he had received--it seemed curious how many matters there
were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. Muishkin thought
that Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness.
It was apparent now, when he entered, that he, was convinced that the
moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last.

But all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at
Lebedeff's to consult him on an urgent matter of business. If he had
anticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was
soon undeceived. The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little
absent-minded, and asked none of the questions--one in particular--that
Gania had expected. So he imitated the prince's demeanour, and talked
fast and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their
thoughts were engaged. Among other things Gania told his host that
Nastasia Philipovna had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that
everyone was talking about her already. She was staying with Daria
Alexeyevna, in an ugly little house in Mattrossky Street, but drove
about in the smartest carriage in the place. A crowd of followers
had pursued her from the first, young and old. Some escorted her on
horse-back when she took the air in her carriage.

She was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and
admitted few into her narrow circle. Yet she already had a numerous
following and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need.
One gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her
account, and an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the
same reason.

She was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen,
a distant relative of her hostess. This young lady sang very well; in
fact, her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house.
Nastasia, however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole. She
dressed quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies
in Pavlofsk mad with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her
carriage and horses.

"As for yesterday's episode," continued Gania, "of course it was
pre-arranged." Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how
he knew that. But the prince did not inquire. Concerning Evgenie
Pavlovitch, Gania stated, without being asked, that he believed the
former had not known Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had
probably been introduced to her by somebody in the park during these
four days. As to the question of the IOU's she had spoken of, there
might easily be something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly
a man of wealth, yet certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in
disorder. Arrived at this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off,
and said no more about Nastasia's prank of the previous evening.

At last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and remained
for a few minutes. Without Muishkin's asking her, she informed him that
Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and perhaps would
remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also gone to town,
probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitch's affairs.

"Lizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today," she
added, as she went out, "but the most curious thing is that Aglaya has
quarrelled with her whole family; not only with her father and mother,
but with her sisters also. It is not a good sign." She said all this
quite casually, though it was extremely important in the eyes of
the prince, and went off with her brother. Regarding the episode of
"Pavlicheff's son," Gania had been absolutely silent, partly from a kind
of false modesty, partly, perhaps, to "spare the prince's feelings." The
latter, however, thanked him again for the trouble he had taken in the
affair.

Muishkin was glad enough to be left alone. He went out of the garden,
crossed the road, and entered the park. He wished to reflect, and to
make up his mind as to a certain "step." This step was one of those
things, however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for
or against hastily, and without much reflection. The fact is, he felt a
longing to leave all this and go away--go anywhere, if only it were
far enough, and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone. He felt a
presentiment that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and
among these people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and permanently.
However, in a very few minutes he decided that to run away was
impossible; that it would be cowardly; that great problems lay before
him, and that he had no right to leave them unsolved, or at least to
refuse to give all his energy and strength to the attempt to solve them.
Having come to this determination, he turned and went home, his walk
having lasted less than a quarter of an hour. At that moment he was
thoroughly unhappy.

Lebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to
penetrate into the prince's apartments. He was not drunk, but in a
confidential and talkative mood. He announced that he had come to tell
the story of his life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk for
that purpose. There was no means of turning him out; nothing short of an
earthquake would have removed him.

In the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history;
but after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which
was that "having ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every
vestige of morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft." "Could
you imagine such a thing?" said he.

"Listen to me, Keller," returned the prince. "If I were in your place, I
should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for some
reason. But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than you
are, purposely?"

"I should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it now
as a help to my soul's evolution. When I die, that secret will die with
me! But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea, how
difficult it is to get money nowadays! Where to find it is the question.
Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: 'Give us gold, jewels, or
diamonds, and it will be quite easy.' Exactly what one has not got! Can
you picture that to yourself? I got angry at last, and said, 'I
suppose you would accept emeralds?' 'Certainly, we accept emeralds with
pleasure. Yes!' 'Well, that's all right,' said I. 'Go to the devil, you
den of thieves!' And with that I seized my hat, and walked out."

"Had you any emeralds?" asked the prince.

"What? I have emeralds? Oh, prince! with what simplicity, with what
almost pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!"

Could not something be made of this man under good influences? asked the
prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his visitor.
He thought little of the value of his own personal influence, not from
a sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at things
in general. Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated and more
interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring it to a
close. Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having been guilty
of many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince that he
could mention them, even to him. At every fresh avowal he professed the
deepest repentance, and described himself as being "bathed in tears";
but this did not prevent him from putting on a boastful air at times,
and some of his stories were so absurdly comical that both he and the
prince laughed like madmen.

"One point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind,
and extreme truthfulness," said the prince at last. "Do you know that
that atones for much?"

"I am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!" said Keller,
much softened. "But, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a
dream, if one may put it so? It never appears in practice or deed. Now,
why is that? I can never understand."

"Do not despair. I think we may say without fear of deceiving ourselves,
that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life. I, at
least, think it would be impossible to add much to what you have just
told me."

"Impossible?" cried Keller, almost pityingly. "Oh prince, how little you
really seem to understand human nature!"

"Is there really much more to be added?" asked the prince, with mild
surprise. "Well, what is it you really want of me? Speak out; tell me
why you came to make your confession to me?"

"What did I want? Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like
you. It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. I know you for
one of the best of men... and then... then..."

He hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped
him out.

"Then you wanted me to lend you money?"

The words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly.

Keller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the
table with his fist.

"Well, prince, that's enough to knock me down! It astounds me! Here you
are, as simple and innocent as a knight of the golden age, and yet...
yet... you read a man's soul like a psychologist! Now, do explain it to
me, prince, because I... I really do not understand!... Of course, my
aim was to borrow money all along, and you... you asked the question
as if there was nothing blameable in it--as if you thought it quite
natural."

"Yes... from you it is quite natural."

"And you are not offended?"

"Why should I be offended?"

"Well, just listen, prince. I remained here last evening, partly because
I have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue. I
enjoyed a discussion over him till three o'clock in the morning, with
Lebedeff; and then... then--I swear by all I hold sacred that I am
telling you the truth--then I wished to develop my soul in this frank
and heartfelt confession to you. This was my thought as I was sobbing
myself to sleep at dawn. Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in
my soul, tears on my face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea
from hell struck me. 'Why not, after confessing, borrow money from him?'
You see, this confession was a kind of masterstroke; I intended to use
it as a means to your good grace and favour--and then--then I meant to
walk off with a hundred and fifty roubles. Now, do you not call that
base?"

"It is hardly an exact statement of the case," said the prince in reply.
"You have confused your motives and ideas, as I need scarcely say too
often happens to myself. I can assure you, Keller, I reproach myself
bitterly for it sometimes. When you were talking just now I seemed to be
listening to something about myself. At times I have imagined that all
men were the same," he continued earnestly, for he appeared to be much
interested in the conversation, "and that consoled me in a certain
degree, for a DOUBLE motive is a thing most difficult to fight against.
I have tried, and I know. God knows whence they arise, these ideas that
you speak of as base. I fear these double motives more than ever just
now, but I am not your judge, and in my opinion it is going too far to
give the name of baseness to it--what do you think? You were going
to employ your tears as a ruse in order to borrow money, but you also
say--in fact, you have sworn to the fact--that independently of this
your confession was made with an honourable motive. As for the money,
you want it for drink, do you not? After your confession, that is
weakness, of course; but, after all, how can anyone give up a bad habit
at a moment's notice? It is impossible. What can we do? It is best, I
think, to leave the matter to your own conscience. How does it seem to
you?" As he concluded the prince looked curiously at Keller; evidently
this problem of double motives had often been considered by him before.

"Well, how anybody can call you an idiot after that, is more than I can
understand!" cried the boxer.

The prince reddened slightly.

"Bourdaloue, the archbishop, would not have spared a man like me,"
Keller continued, "but you, you have judged me with humanity. To show
how grateful I am, and as a punishment, I will not accept a hundred and
fifty roubles. Give me twenty-five--that will be enough; it is all I
really need, for a fortnight at least. I will not ask you for more for
a fortnight. I should like to have given Agatha a present, but she does
not really deserve it. Oh, my dear prince, God bless you!"

At this moment Lebedeff appeared, having just arrived from Petersburg.
He frowned when he saw the twenty-five rouble note in Keller's hand, but
the latter, having got the money, went away at once. Lebedeff began to
abuse him.

"You are unjust; I found him sincerely repentant," observed the prince,
after listening for a time.

"What is the good of repentance like that? It is the same exactly as
mine yesterday, when I said, 'I am base, I am base,'--words, and nothing
more!"

"Then they were only words on your part? I thought, on the contrary..."

"Well, I don't mind telling you the truth--you only! Because you see
through a man somehow. Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all
jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere. I feel the
deepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and lies
come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other people.
It is always there--the notion of cheating people, and of using my
repentant tears to my own advantage! I assure you this is the truth,
prince! I would not tell any other man for the world! He would laugh and
jeer at me--but you, you judge a man humanely."

"Why, Keller said the same thing to me nearly word for word a few
minutes ago!" cried Muishkin. "And you both seem inclined to boast about
it! You astonish me, but I think he is more sincere than you, for you
make a regular trade of it. Oh, don't put on that pathetic expression,
and don't put your hand on your heart! Have you anything to say to me?
You have not come for nothing..."

Lebedeff grinned and wriggled.

"I have been waiting all day for you, because I want to ask you a
question; and, for once in your life, please tell me the truth at once.
Had you anything to do with that affair of the carriage yesterday?"

Lebedeff began to grin again, rubbed his hands, sneezed, but spoke not a
word in reply.

"I see you had something to do with it."

"Indirectly, quite indirectly! I am speaking the truth--I am indeed!
I merely told a certain person that I had people in my house, and that
such and such personages might be found among them."

"I am aware that you sent your son to that house--he told me so himself
just now, but what is this intrigue?" said the prince, impatiently.

"It is not my intrigue!" cried Lebedeff, waving his hand.

"It was engineered by other people, and is, properly speaking, rather a
fantasy than an intrigue!"

"But what is it all about? Tell me, for Heaven's sake! Cannot you
understand how nearly it touches me? Why are they blackening Evgenie
Pavlovitch's reputation?"

Lebedeff grimaced and wriggled again.

"Prince!" said he. "Excellency! You won't let me tell you the whole
truth; I have tried to explain; more than once I have begun, but you
have not allowed me to go on..."

The prince gave no answer, and sat deep in thought. Evidently he was
struggling to decide.

"Very well! Tell me the truth," he said, dejectedly.

"Aglaya Ivanovna..." began Lebedeff, promptly.

"Be silent! At once!" interrupted the prince, red with indignation, and
perhaps with shame, too. "It is impossible and absurd! All that has been
invented by you, or fools like you! Let me never hear you say a word
again on that subject!"

Late in the evening Colia came in with a whole budget of Petersburg and
Pavlofsk news. He did not dwell much on the Petersburg part of it, which
consisted chiefly of intelligence about his friend Hippolyte, but passed
quickly to the Pavlofsk tidings. He had gone straight to the Epanchins'
from the station.

"There's the deuce and all going on there!" he said. "First of all about
the row last night, and I think there must be something new as well,
though I didn't like to ask. Not a word about YOU, prince, the whole
time! The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been quarrelling
with her people about Gania. Colia did not know any details, except that
it had been a terrible quarrel! Also Evgenie Pavlovitch had called, and
met with an excellent reception all round. And another curious thing:
Mrs. Epanchin was so angry that she called Varia to her--Varia was
talking to the girls--and turned her out of the house 'once for all' she
said. I heard it from Varia herself--Mrs. Epanchin was quite polite,
but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to the girls, she told them
nothing about it, and they didn't know they were saying goodbye for the
last time. I'm sorry for Varia, and for Gania too; he isn't half a bad
fellow, in spite of his faults, and I shall never forgive myself for not
liking him before! I don't know whether I ought to continue to go to the
Epanchins' now," concluded Colia--"I like to be quite independent of
others, and of other people's quarrels if I can; but I must think over
it."

"I don't think you need break your heart over Gania," said the prince;
"for if what you say is true, he must be considered dangerous in the
Epanchin household, and if so, certain hopes of his must have been
encouraged."

"What? What hopes?" cried Colia; "you surely don't mean Aglaya?--oh,
no!--"

"You're a dreadful sceptic, prince," he continued, after a moment's
silence. "I have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about
everything. You don't seem to believe in people as you did, and are
always attributing motives and so on--am I using the word 'sceptic' in
its proper sense?"

"I believe so; but I'm not sure."

"Well, I'll change it, right or wrong; I'll say that you are not
sceptical, but JEALOUS. There! you are deadly jealous of Gania, over
a certain proud damsel! Come!" Colia jumped up, with these words, and
burst out laughing. He laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before,
and still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples. He was
delighted that the prince should be jealous about Aglaya. However, he
stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and the
conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more.

Next day the prince had to go to town, on business. Returning in the
afternoon, he happened upon General Epanchin at the station. The latter
seized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid
of being caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class
compartment. He was burning to speak about something of importance.

"In the first place, my dear prince, don't be angry with me. I would
have come to see you yesterday, but I didn't know how Lizabetha
Prokofievna would take it. My dear fellow, my house is simply a hell
just now, a sort of sphinx has taken up its abode there. We live in an
atmosphere of riddles; I can't make head or tail of anything. As for
you, I feel sure you are the least to blame of any of us, though you
certainly have been the cause of a good deal of trouble. You see, it's
all very pleasant to be a philanthropist; but it can be carried too far.
Of course I admire kind-heartedness, and I esteem my wife, but--"

The general wandered on in this disconnected way for a long time; it
was clear that he was much disturbed by some circumstance which he could
make nothing of.

"It is plain to me, that YOU are not in it at all," he continued, at
last, a little less vaguely, "but perhaps you had better not come to
our house for a little while. I ask you in the friendliest manner,
mind; just till the wind changes again. As for Evgenie Pavlovitch," he
continued with some excitement, "the whole thing is a calumny, a dirty
calumny. It is simply a plot, an intrigue, to upset our plans and to
stir up a quarrel. You see, prince, I'll tell you privately, Evgenie and
ourselves have not said a word yet, we have no formal understanding, we
are in no way bound on either side, but the word may be said very soon,
don't you see, VERY soon, and all this is most injurious, and is meant
to be so. Why? I'm sure I can't tell you. She's an extraordinary woman,
you see, an eccentric woman; I tell you I am so frightened of that woman
that I can't sleep. What a carriage that was, and where did it come
from, eh? I declare, I was base enough to suspect Evgenie at first; but
it seems certain that that cannot be the case, and if so, why is she
interfering here? That's the riddle, what does she want? Is it to keep
Evgenie to herself? But, my dear fellow, I swear to you, I swear he
doesn't even KNOW her, and as for those bills, why, the whole thing is
an invention! And the familiarity of the woman! It's quite clear we must
treat the impudent creature's attempt with disdain, and redouble our
courtesy towards Evgenie. I told my wife so.

"Now I'll tell you my secret conviction. I'm certain that she's doing
this to revenge herself on me, on account of the past, though I assure
you that all the time I was blameless. I blush at the very idea. And
now she turns up again like this, when I thought she had finally
disappeared! Where's Rogojin all this time? I thought she was Mrs.
Rogojin, long ago."

The old man was in a state of great mental perturbation. The whole of
the journey, which occupied nearly an hour, he continued in this strain,
putting questions and answering them himself, shrugging his shoulders,
pressing the prince's hand, and assuring the latter that, at all
events, he had no suspicion whatever of HIM. This last assurance was
satisfactory, at all events. The general finished by informing him that
Evgenie's uncle was head of one of the civil service departments, and
rich, very rich, and a gourmand. "And, well, Heaven preserve him, of
course--but Evgenie gets his money, don't you see? But, for all this,
I'm uncomfortable, I don't know why. There's something in the air, I
feel there's something nasty in the air, like a bat, and I'm by no means
comfortable."

And it was not until the third day that the formal reconciliation
between the prince and the Epanchins took place, as said before.

XII.

IT was seven in the evening, and the prince was just preparing to go
out for a walk in the park, when suddenly Mrs. Epanchin appeared on the
terrace.

"In the first place, don't dare to suppose," she began, "that I am going
to apologize. Nonsense! You were entirely to blame."

The prince remained silent.

"Were you to blame, or not?"

"No, certainly not, no more than yourself, though at first I thought I
was."

"Oh, very well, let's sit down, at all events, for I don't intend to
stand up all day. And remember, if you say, one word about 'mischievous
urchins,' I shall go away and break with you altogether. Now then, did
you, or did you not, send a letter to Aglaya, a couple of months or so
ago, about Easter-tide?"

"Yes!"

"What for? What was your object? Show me the letter." Mrs. Epanchin's
eyes flashed; she was almost trembling with impatience.

"I have not got the letter," said the prince, timidly, extremely
surprised at the turn the conversation had taken. "If anyone has it, if
it still exists, Aglaya Ivanovna must have it."

"No finessing, please. What did you write about?"

"I am not finessing, and I am not in the least afraid of telling you;
but I don't see the slightest reason why I should not have written."

"Be quiet, you can talk afterwards! What was the letter about? Why are
you blushing?"

The prince was silent. At last he spoke.

"I don't understand your thoughts, Lizabetha Prokofievna; but I can see
that the fact of my having written is for some reason repugnant to you.
You must admit that I have a perfect right to refuse to answer your
questions; but, in order to show you that I am neither ashamed of
the letter, nor sorry that I wrote it, and that I am not in the least
inclined to blush about it" (here the prince's blushes redoubled), "I
will repeat the substance of my letter, for I think I know it almost by
heart."

So saying, the prince repeated the letter almost word for word, as he
had written it.

"My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have
signified, pray? If it had any meaning at all!" said Mrs. Epanchin,
cuttingly, after having listened with great attention.

"I really don't absolutely know myself; I know my feeling was very
sincere. I had moments at that time full of life and hope."

"What sort of hope?"

"It is difficult to explain, but certainly not the hopes you have in
your mind. Hopes--well, in a word, hopes for the future, and a feeling
of joy that THERE, at all events, I was not entirely a stranger and a
foreigner. I felt an ecstasy in being in my native land once more; and
one sunny morning I took up a pen and wrote her that letter, but why to
HER, I don't quite know. Sometimes one longs to have a friend near, and
I evidently felt the need of one then," added the prince, and paused.

"Are you in love with her?"

"N-no! I wrote to her as to a sister; I signed myself her brother."

"Oh yes, of course, on purpose! I quite understand."

"It is very painful to me to answer these questions, Lizabetha
Prokofievna."

"I dare say it is; but that's no affair of mine. Now then, assure me
truly as before Heaven, are you lying to me or not?"

"No, I am not lying."

"Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?"

"I believe it is the absolute truth."

"'I believe,' indeed! Did that mischievous urchin give it to her?"

"I asked Nicolai Ardalionovitch..."

"The urchin! the urchin!" interrupted Lizabetha Prokofievna in an angry
voice. "I do not want to know if it were Nicolai Ardalionovitch! The
urchin!"

"Nicolai Ardalionovitch..."

"The urchin, I tell you!"

"No, it was not the urchin: it was Nicolai Ardalionovitch," said the
prince very firmly, but without raising his voice.

"Well, all right! All right, my dear! I shall put that down to your
account."

She was silent a moment to get breath, and to recover her composure.

"Well!--and what's the meaning of the 'poor knight,' eh?"

"I don't know in the least; I wasn't present when the joke was made. It
IS a joke. I suppose, and that's all."

"Well, that's a comfort, at all events. You don't suppose she could take
any interest in you, do you? Why, she called you an 'idiot' herself."

"I think you might have spared me that," murmured the prince
reproachfully, almost in a whisper.

"Don't be angry; she is a wilful, mad, spoilt girl. If she likes a
person she will pitch into him, and chaff him. I used to be just such
another. But for all that you needn't flatter yourself, my boy; she is
not for you. I don't believe it, and it is not to be. I tell you so at
once, so that you may take proper precautions. Now, I want to hear you
swear that you are not married to that woman?"

"Lizabetha Prokofievna, what are you thinking of?" cried the prince,
almost leaping to his feet in amazement.

"Why? You very nearly were, anyhow."

"Yes--I nearly was," whispered the prince, hanging his head.

"Well then, have you come here for HER? Are you in love with HER? With
THAT creature?"

"I did not come to marry at all," replied the prince.

"Is there anything you hold sacred?"

"There is."

"Then swear by it that you did not come here to marry HER!"

"I'll swear it by whatever you please."

"I believe you. You may kiss me; I breathe freely at last. But you must
know, my dear friend, Aglaya does not love you, and she shall never be
your wife while I am out of my grave. So be warned in time. Do you hear
me?"

"Yes, I hear."

The prince flushed up so much that he could not look her in the face.

"I have waited for you with the greatest impatience (not that you were
worth it). Every night I have drenched my pillow with tears, not for
you, my friend, not for you, don't flatter yourself! I have my own
grief, always the same, always the same. But I'll tell you why I have
been awaiting you so impatiently, because I believe that Providence
itself sent you to be a friend and a brother to me. I haven't a friend
in the world except Princess Bielokonski, and she is growing as stupid
as a sheep from old age. Now then, tell me, yes or no? Do you know why
she called out from her carriage the other night?"

"I give you my word of honour that I had nothing to do with the matter
and know nothing about it."

"Very well, I believe you. I have my own ideas about it. Up to yesterday
morning I thought it was really Evgenie Pavlovitch who was to blame; now
I cannot help agreeing with the others. But why he was made such a fool
of I cannot understand. However, he is not going to marry Aglaya, I can
tell you that. He may be a very excellent fellow, but--so it shall be.
I was not at all sure of accepting him before, but now I have quite made
up my mind that I won't have him. 'Put me in my coffin first and then
into my grave, and then you may marry my daughter to whomsoever you
please,' so I said to the general this very morning. You see how I trust
you, my boy."

"Yes, I see and understand."

Mrs. Epanchin gazed keenly into the prince's eyes. She was anxious to
see what impression the news as to Evgenie Pavlovitch had made upon him.

"Do you know anything about Gavrila Ardalionovitch?" she asked at last.

"Oh yes, I know a good deal."

"Did you know he had communications with Aglaya?"

"No, I didn't," said the prince, trembling a little, and in great
agitation. "You say Gavrila Ardalionovitch has private communications
with Aglaya?--Impossible!"

"Only quite lately. His sister has been working like a rat to clear the
way for him all the winter."

"I don't believe it!" said the prince abruptly, after a short pause.
"Had it been so I should have known long ago."

"Oh, of course, yes; he would have come and wept out his secret on your
bosom. Oh, you simpleton--you simpleton! Anyone can deceive you and take
you in like a--like a,--aren't you ashamed to trust him? Can't you see
that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?"

"I know very well that he does deceive me occasionally, and he knows
that I know it, but--" The prince did not finish his sentence.

"And that's why you trust him, eh? So I should have supposed. Good Lord,
was there ever such a man as you? Tfu! and are you aware, sir, that this
Gania, or his sister Varia, have brought her into correspondence with
Nastasia Philipovna?"

"Brought whom?" cried Muishkin.

"Aglaya."

"I don't believe it! It's impossible! What object could they have?" He
jumped up from his chair in his excitement.

"Nor do I believe it, in spite of the proofs. The girl is self-willed
and fantastic, and insane! She's wicked, wicked! I'll repeat it for
a thousand years that she's wicked; they ALL are, just now, all my
daughters, even that 'wet hen' Alexandra. And yet I don't believe it.
Because I don't choose to believe it, perhaps; but I don't. Why haven't
you been?" she turned on the prince suddenly. "Why didn't you come near
us all these three days, eh?"

The prince began to give his reasons, but she interrupted him again.

"Everybody takes you in and deceives you; you went to town yesterday. I
dare swear you went down on your knees to that rogue, and begged him to
accept your ten thousand roubles!"

"I never thought of doing any such thing. I have not seen him, and he is
not a rogue, in my opinion. I have had a letter from him."

"Show it me!"

The prince took a paper from his pocket-book, and handed it to Lizabetha
Prokofievna. It ran as follows:


"SIR,

"In the eyes of the world I am sure that I have no cause for pride or
self-esteem. I am much too insignificant for that. But what may be so to
other men's eyes is not so to yours. I am convinced that you are better
than other people. Doktorenko disagrees with me, but I am content to
differ from him on this point. I will never accept one single copeck
from you, but you have helped my mother, and I am bound to be grateful
to you for that, however weak it may seem. At any rate, I have changed
my opinion about you, and I think right to inform you of the fact; but I
also suppose that there can be no further inter course between us.

"ANTIP BURDOVSKY.

"P.S.--The two hundred roubles I owe you shall certainly be repaid in
time."


"How extremely stupid!" cried Mrs. Epanchin, giving back the letter
abruptly. "It was not worth the trouble of reading. Why are you
smiling?"

"Confess that you are pleased to have read it."

"What! Pleased with all that nonsense! Why, cannot you see that they are
all infatuated with pride and vanity?"

"He has acknowledged himself to be in the wrong. Don't you see that the
greater his vanity, the more difficult this admission must have been on
his part? Oh, what a little child you are, Lizabetha Prokofievna!"

"Are you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?"

"Not at all. I am only proving that you are glad about the letter. Why
conceal your real feelings? You always like to do it."

"Never come near my house again!" cried Mrs. Epanchin, pale with rage.
"Don't let me see as much as a SHADOW of you about the place! Do you
hear?"

"Oh yes, and in three days you'll come and invite me yourself. Aren't
you ashamed now? These are your best feelings; you are only tormenting
yourself."

"I'll die before I invite you! I shall forget your very name! I've
forgotten it already!"

She marched towards the door.

"But I'm forbidden your house as it is, without your added threats!"
cried the prince after her.

"What? Who forbade you?"

She turned round so suddenly that one might have supposed a needle had
been stuck into her.

The prince hesitated. He perceived that he had said too much now.

"WHO forbade you?" cried Mrs. Epanchin once more.

"Aglaya Ivanovna told me--"

"When? Speak--quick!"

"She sent to say, yesterday morning, that I was never to dare to come
near the house again."

Lizabetha Prokofievna stood like a stone.

"What did she send? Whom? Was it that boy? Was it a message?-quick!"

"I had a note," said the prince.

"Where is it? Give it here, at once."

The prince thought a moment. Then he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket
an untidy slip of paper, on which was scrawled:


"PRINCE LEF NICOLAIEVITCH,--If you think fit, after all that has passed,
to honour our house with a visit, I can assure you you will not find me
among the number of those who are in any way delighted to see you.

"AGLAYA EPANCHIN."


Mrs. Epanchin reflected a moment. The next minute she flew at the
prince, seized his hand, and dragged him after her to the door.

"Quick--come along!" she cried, breathless with agitation and
impatience. "Come along with me this moment!"

"But you declared I wasn't--"

"Don't be a simpleton. You behave just as though you weren't a man at
all. Come on! I shall see, now, with my own eyes. I shall see all."

"Well, let me get my hat, at least."

"Here's your miserable hat He couldn't even choose a respectable shape
for his hat! Come on! She did that because I took your part and said you
ought to have come--little vixen!--else she would never have sent you
that silly note. It's a most improper note, I call it; most improper for
such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write. H'm! I dare say she
was annoyed that you didn't come; but she ought to have known that one
can't write like that to an idiot like you, for you'd be sure to take it
literally." Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with her all
the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant. "What are you
listening for?" she added, seeing that she had committed herself a
little. "She wants a clown like you--she hasn't seen one for some
time--to play with. That's why she is anxious for you to come to the
house. And right glad I am that she'll make a thorough good fool of you.
You deserve it; and she can do it--oh! she can, indeed!--as well as most
people."




PART III

I.

THE Epanchin family, or at least the more serious members of it, were
sometimes grieved because they seemed so unlike the rest of the world.
They were not quite certain, but had at times a strong suspicion that
things did not happen to them as they did to other people. Others led a
quiet, uneventful life, while they were subject to continual upheavals.
Others kept on the rails without difficulty; they ran off at the
slightest obstacle. Other houses were governed by a timid routine;
theirs was somehow different. Perhaps Lizabetha Prokofievna was alone
in making these fretful observations; the girls, though not wanting in
intelligence, were still young; the general was intelligent, too, but
narrow, and in any difficulty he was content to say, "H'm!" and leave
the matter to his wife. Consequently, on her fell the responsibility. It
was not that they distinguished themselves as a family by any particular
originality, or that their excursions off the track led to any breach of
the proprieties. Oh no.

There was nothing premeditated, there was not even any conscious purpose
in it all, and yet, in spite of everything, the family, although highly
respected, was not quite what every highly respected family ought to be.
For a long time now Lizabetha Prokofievna had had it in her mind that
all the trouble was owing to her "unfortunate character," and this
added to her distress. She blamed her own stupid unconventional
"eccentricity." Always restless, always on the go, she constantly seemed
to lose her way, and to get into trouble over the simplest and more
ordinary affairs of life.
