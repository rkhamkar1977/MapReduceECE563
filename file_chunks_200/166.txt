<q rend='post'>I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.</q>
</p>

<p>
The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees
only along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees,
maples, limes and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an
empty grass space, from which several hundredweight of hay was
carried in the summer. The garden was let out for a few roubles
for the summer. There were also plantations of raspberries and currants
and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen garden
had been planted lately near the house.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden.
There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant,
elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green
summer-house, blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work,
but there was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows
when this summer-house was built. There was a tradition that it
had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called
von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It was all in decay,
the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled
musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed
in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which
it was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw
half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's brandy,</q> Mitya laughed. <q rend='pre'>I see your look: <q>He's drinking
again!</q> Distrust the apparition.</q>

<p>
<q rend='post'>I'm not drinking, I'm only <q>indulging,</q> as that pig, your Rakitin,
says. He'll be a civil councilor one day, but he'll always talk about
<q>indulging.</q> Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and
press you to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world&mdash;in
reality&mdash;in re-al-i-ty&mdash;(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!</q>
</p>

<p>
He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.
</p>

<p>
<q>No one but you and one <q>jade</q> I have fallen in love with, to
my ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in
love with a woman and yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk
about it gayly still. Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside
you and look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and
I'll go on talking, for the time has come. But on reflection, you
know, I'd better speak quietly, for here&mdash;here&mdash;you can never tell
what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, <q>the
story will be continued.</q> Why have I been longing for you? Why
have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's
five days since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I
can tell everything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow
I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending
and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling
down a precipice into a pit? That's just how I'm falling, but not in
a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At least, I
am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not enjoyment though, but ecstasy.
Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish
spirit&mdash;whatever it is! Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine,
how clear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it's still summer;
four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness! Where were you
going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's
first.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny
of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and
to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with
father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted
to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you really mean to send me?</q> cried Alyosha with a distressed
expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once.
But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's why
you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is her note.</q> Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya
looked through it quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for
sending him by the back-way, and he came to me like the golden
fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen,
brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some
one. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell an
angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and
judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that some one above
me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything
on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,
and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and
says, <q>Do this for me</q>&mdash;some favor never asked before that could
only be asked on one's deathbed&mdash;would that other refuse, if he were
a friend or a brother?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste! H'm!... Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you
hurry and worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the
world has taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't
understand ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you
didn't understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying?
<q>Be noble, O man!</q>&mdash;who says that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed,
his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were
silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> said Mitya, <q rend='pre'>you're the only one who won't laugh.
I should like to begin&mdash;my confession&mdash;with Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Hymn

There's a terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible
lot of trouble. Don't think I'm only a brute in an officer's uniform,
wallowing in dirt and drink. I hardly think of anything but
of that degraded man&mdash;if only I'm not lying. I pray God I'm

<p>
But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I
don't kiss her. I don't cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a
peasant or a shepherd? I go on and I don't know whether I'm going
to shame or to light and joy. That's the trouble, for everything in
the world is a riddle! And whenever I've happened to sink into the
vilest degradation (and it's always been happening) I always read
that poem about Ceres and man. Has it reformed me? Never!
For I'm a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong
with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that
degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very
depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be
accursed. Let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the
veil in which my God is shrouded. Though I may be following
the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the
joy without which the world cannot stand.

<q rend='post'>I am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All we
Karamazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives
in you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests,
because sensual lust is a tempest&mdash;worse than a tempest! Beauty
is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been
fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but
riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side
by side. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I've thought a
lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many
riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as we can,
and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't endure
the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the
ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's
still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul
does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be
on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth
and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed. I'd have him
narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it! What to the
mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind
beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The
awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and
the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man.
But a man always talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to
facts.</q>

<head>Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;In Anecdote</head>

<p>
<q>I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I
spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That's
a swinish invention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if
there was, I didn't need money simply for <emph>that</emph>. With me money is
an accessory, the overflow of my heart, the framework. To-day she
would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out of the streets in her
place. I entertained them both. I threw away money by the handful
on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the ladies,
too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be
pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of
them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths,
little dark back-alleys behind the main road&mdash;there one finds adventures
and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking
figuratively, brother. In the town I was in, there were no such
back-alleys in the literal sense, but morally there were. If you were
like me, you'd know what that means. I loved vice, I loved the
ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a
noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole lot
of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and
I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her to kiss me. She
was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature.
She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She thought,
poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer
(I was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't say a word
to her for five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we
were always having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how
they glowed with fire&mdash;a fire of gentle indignation. This game
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul. Five months
later she married an official and left the town, still angry, and still,
perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily. Observe that
I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low desires,
and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable. You're blushing; your
eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this was
nothing much&mdash;wayside blossoms <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
la</foreign> Paul de Kock&mdash;though the
cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect
album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I
tried to break it off without quarreling. And I never gave them
away. I never bragged of one of them. But that's enough. You
can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense.
No, I'm going to tell you something more curious; and don't be surprised
that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You say that because I blushed,</q> Alyosha said suddenly. <q>I
wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I
blushed because I am the same as you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You? Come, that's going a little too far!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not too far,</q> said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea
was not a new one). <q>The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom
step, and you're above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's
how I see it. But it's all the same. Absolutely the same in kind.
Any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then one ought not to step on at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Any one who can help it had better not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you
touch me so. That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told
me once that she'd devour you one day. There, there, I won't!
From this field of corruption fouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy,
also befouled by flies, that is by every sort of vileness. Although
the old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was
something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and
then it did not come off. The old man who has reproached me
with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never
told any one about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course&mdash;Ivan
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But
Ivan's a tomb.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's a tomb?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened with great attention.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,
like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in
the little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be
rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other
ways as well. Although they shook their heads over me, they
liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike
to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends,
and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn't do me
much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with
proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was
really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two
wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left
a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of
four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father
and an aunt, her mother's sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate;
the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things about
people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than
Agafya&mdash;fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn't
bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full
figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had not
married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but
was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in <q>that</q> way,
it was pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women
quite innocently. I used to talk to her with shocking frankness,
and she only laughed. Many women like such freedom, and she
was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one
could never think of her as a young lady. She and her aunt lived
in her father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting
themselves on an equality with other people. She was a general
favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever dressmaker.
She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without asking
for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn't refuse.
The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained
the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I
arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the
expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty,
who had just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second
daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second
wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although, as
I learnt on good authority, she too brought the colonel no money.
She had connections, and that was all. There may have been expectations,
but they had come to nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit,
the whole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies&mdash;two <q>Excellencies</q>
and a colonel's wife&mdash;and all the rest following their
lead, at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honor.
She was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tableaux vivants</foreign>
in aid of distressed governesses. I took no notice, I went
on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at the time set all the
town talking. I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the
battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained
her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an evening
party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed her
lips scornfully. <q>Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,</q> thought I. I
behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I
was conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt
that <q>Katenka</q> was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a
person of character, proud and really high-principled; above all, she
had education and intellect, and I had neither. You think I meant
to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge myself,
because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to feel it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel
put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father
sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed
giving up all claims upon him&mdash;settling our accounts, so to speak,
and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more. I didn't understand
a word of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha, till
the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been able to
make head or tail of my money affairs with father. But never
mind that, we'll talk of it later.</q>
</p>

<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling
me something that interested me immensely. The authorities,
I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected
of irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise
for him. And then the commander of the division arrived,
and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was
ordered to retire. I won't tell you how it all happened. He had
enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the
town towards him and all his family. His friends all turned their
backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya Ivanovna,
with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, <q>Do you know
there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your
father's accounts?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general
was here not long ago, and everything was all right.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Then it was, but now it isn't.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She was terribly scared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Don't frighten me!</q> she said. <q>Who told you so?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Don't be uneasy,</q> I said, <q>I won't tell any one. You know
I'm as silent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of <q>possibilities,</q>
to add, that when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your
father, and he can't produce it, he'll be tried, and made to serve
as a common soldier in his old age, unless you like to send me
your young lady secretly. I've just had money paid me. I'll give
her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Ah, you scoundrel!</q>&mdash;that's what she said. <q>You wicked
scoundrel! How dare you!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her
once more that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple
creatures, Agafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved
like perfect angels all through this business. They genuinely adored
their <q>Katya,</q> thought her far above them, and waited on her, hand
and foot. But Agafya told her of our conversation. I found that
out afterwards. She didn't keep it back, and of course that was
all I wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion.
The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't
leave his room for two days, and didn't hand over the government
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
money. Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill. But I
knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the last
four years the money had never been in his hands except when the
Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend it to a
trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old
widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to
go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return
the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present from the
fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time (I heard all about
it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth
and one of the most vicious in the world)&mdash;this time, I say, Trifonov
brought nothing back from the fair. The lieutenant-colonel flew
to him. <q>I've never received any money from you, and couldn't
possibly have received any.</q> That was all the answer he got. So
now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel
round his head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it. All
at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order
to <q>hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.</q>
He signed the book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards),
stood up, saying he would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom,
loaded his double-barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot
off his right foot, fixed the gun against his chest, and began feeling
for the trigger with his foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had
told her, had her suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room
just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon him from behind,
threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling,
but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held
him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home,
it was getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had
dressed, brushed my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up
my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and facing me in the room
stood Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen
her in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged
with two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most
obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request
were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts. Of course I
grasped the position at once. She walked in and looked straight at
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>
me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her lips and round
her mouth I saw uncertainty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>My sister told me,</q> she began, <q>that you would give me 4,500
roubles if I came to you for it&mdash;myself. I have come ... give me
the money!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her
voice failed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it
quivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,</q> said Alyosha in
agitation.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened
I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a&mdash;Karamazov one. Once
I was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with
fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then&mdash;a
noxious insect, you understand? I looked her up and down.
You've seen her? She's a beauty. But she was beautiful in another
way then. At that moment she was beautiful because she was
noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her generosity
and sacrifice for her father, and I&mdash;a bug! And, scoundrel
as I was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She
was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous
thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense.
It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I
should act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of
pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I should have gone
next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end honorably, so
to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though I'm a
man of base desires, I'm honest. And at that very second some voice
seemed to whisper in my ear, <q>But when you come to-morrow to
make your proposal, that girl won't even see you; she'll order her
coachman to kick you out of the yard. <q>Publish it through all
the town,</q> she would say, <q>I'm not afraid of you.</q></q> I looked at
the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That is how it
would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from her face now that I
should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. I longed
to play her the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at her with a
sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with
a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.</q>
</p>

<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You've
been counting your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred,
if you like, with all my heart. But four thousand is not a sum to
throw away on such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no
purpose.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I should have lost the game, of course. She'd have run away.
But it would have been an infernal revenge. It would have been
worth it all. I'd have howled with regret all the rest of my life,
only to have played that trick. Would you believe it, it has never
happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her at
such a moment with hatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for
three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred&mdash;that hate which
is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane,
and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep
her long, don't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table,
opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles
(it was lying in a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in
silence, folded it, handed it to her, opened the door into the passage,
and, stepping back, made her a deep bow, a most respectful, a most
impressive bow, believe me! She shuddered all over, gazed at me
for a second, turned horribly pale&mdash;white as a sheet, in fact&mdash;and
all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently, bowed down to my
feet&mdash;not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow, with her
forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing
my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot;
why, I don't know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of
course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that
one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn't stab myself. I
only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard&mdash;which there
was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in
telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to
glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into
the human heart! Well, so much for that <q>adventure</q> with Katerina
Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you&mdash;no one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out
his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha
had to turn quite round to face him.

<p>
<q>Now,</q> said Alyosha, <q>I understand the first half.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You understand the first half. That half is a drama,
and it was played out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is
being acted here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I understand nothing of that second half so far,</q> said
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I? Do you suppose I understand it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, Dmitri. There's one important question. Tell me, you
were betrothed, you are betrothed still?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We weren't betrothed at once, not for three months after that
adventure. The next day I told myself that the incident was closed,
concluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish
to make her an offer. On her side she gave no sign of life for the
six weeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one
action. The day after her visit the maid-servant slipped round
with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the
change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles
was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on
changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I
don't remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation.
I searched the packet for a pencil mark&mdash;n-nothing! Well, I spent
the rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was
obliged to reprimand me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to
the astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the
money untouched. He'd no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to
his bed, and, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he
died five days afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for
he had not had time to receive his discharge. Ten days after his
funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with her aunt and sister, went to Moscow.
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
And, behold, on the very day they went away (I hadn't seen
them, didn't see them off or take leave) I received a tiny note, a
sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line in pencil: <q>I will
write to you. Wait. K.</q> And that was all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes
changed with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness
of an Arabian fairy-tale. That general's widow, their nearest
relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and
next-of-kin&mdash;both died in the same week of small-pox. The old
lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her
one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in Katya's favor. But
that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for present use,
eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she liked
with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in
Moscow, later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred
roubles. I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three
days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now. You
must read it. She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. <q>I
love you madly,</q> she says, <q>even if you don't love me, never mind.
Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way.
I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet. I want
to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.</q> Alyosha,
I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in
my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure
myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't
mind&mdash;that I don't mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it
was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears.
One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her being
rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar! I
mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it
slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him
all I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her.
Why do you look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes,
Ivan fell in love with her; he's in love with her still. I know that.
I did a stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one
stupid thing may be the saving of us all now. Oo! Don't you see
what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she respects him? When she
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>
compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like me, especially
after all that has happened here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not
a man like him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She loves her own <emph>virtue</emph>, not me.</q> The words broke involuntarily,
and almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a
minute later his eyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the
table violently with his fist.
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear, Alyosha,</q> he cried, with intense and genuine anger at
himself; <q>you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ
is God, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just
now, I know that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and
that these lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly
angel's. That's the tragedy of it&mdash;that I know that for certain.
What if any one does show off a bit? Don't I do it myself? And
yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how
he must be cursing nature now&mdash;with his intellect, too! To see the
preference given&mdash;to whom, to what? To a monster who, though
he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his debaucheries&mdash;and
before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man
like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a
girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's
ridiculous! I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of
course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny
will be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while
the undeserving one will vanish into his back-alley for ever&mdash;his
filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is at home and
where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with
enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I use
them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the
back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, Dmitri,</q> Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety.
<q>There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed
all the same, aren't you? How can you break off the
engagement if she, your betrothed, doesn't want to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my
arrival in Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine
style. The general's wife blessed us, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;congratulated
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
Katya. <q>You've made a good choice,</q> she said, <q>I see
right through him.</q> And&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;she didn't like
Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of talk with Katya in
Moscow. I told her about myself&mdash;sincerely, honorably. She
listened to everything.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>There was sweet confusion,</l>
<l>There were tender words.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>Though there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a
mighty promise to reform. I gave my promise, and here&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very
day&mdash;remember it&mdash;to send you&mdash;this very day again&mdash;to Katerina
Ivanovna, and&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, <q>He
sends you his compliments.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But is that possible?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just the reason I'm sending you, in my place, because it's
impossible. And, how could I tell her myself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where are you going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To the back-alley.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Grushenka, then!</q> Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping
his hands. <q>Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought
that you had just visited her, and that was all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible
and with such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world?
Confound it, I have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka,
I ceased to be betrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand
that. Why do you look at me? You see, I went in the
first place to beat her. I had heard, and I know for a fact now, that
that captain, father's agent, had given Grushenka an I.O.U. of
mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an end to me.
They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a glimpse
of her before. She doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about
her old merchant, who's lying ill now, paralyzed; but he's leaving
her a decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money,
that she hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
she's a merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I
stayed. The storm broke&mdash;it struck me down like the plague. I'm
plague-stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that there
will never be anything more for me. The cycle of the ages is
accomplished. That's my position. And though I'm a beggar, as
fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket. I
drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from
here. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants
there drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands
flying. In three days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you
suppose the hero had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I
tell you that rogue, Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her body.
You can see it in her little foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and
kissed it, but that was all, I swear! <q>I'll marry you if you like,</q> she
said, <q>you're a beggar, you know. Say that you won't beat me, and
will let me do anything I choose, and perhaps I will marry you.</q>
She laughed, and she's laughing still!</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as
though he were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you really mean to marry her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At once, if she will. And if she won't, I shall stay all the same.
I'll be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!</q> he cried. He stopped
short before him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking
him violently. <q>Do you know, you innocent boy, that this is all
delirium, senseless delirium, for there's a tragedy here. Let me tell
you, Alexey, that I may be a low man, with low and degraded passions,
but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri Karamazov never can
be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and a pickpocket.
That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka, Katerina
Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don't know, I
suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of
the province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna
in Moscow, so that nothing should be known of it in the town here.
So I had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to
see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards
I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her the
post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring
the receipt, and so far I haven't brought it. I've forgotten it. Now
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>
what do you think you're going to her to-day to say? <q>He sends his
compliments,</q> and she'll ask you, <q>What about the money?</q> You
might still have said to her, <q>He's a degraded sensualist, and a low
creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn't send your money
then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn't control
himself.</q> But still you might have added, <q>He isn't a thief though.
Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to
Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say <q>he sends his compliments.</q></q>
But, as it is, she will ask, <q>But where is the money?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think.
Don't worry yourself to death with despair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, do you suppose I'd shoot myself because I can't get three
thousand to pay back? That's just it. I shan't shoot myself. I
haven't the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I'm
going to Grushenka. I don't care what happens.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers
come, I'll go into the next room. I'll clean her friends' goloshes,
blow up their samovar, run their errands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,</q> Alyosha said solemnly.
<q>She'll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She
has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you.
She'll see that for herself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She won't forgive everything,</q> said Dmitri, with a grin.
<q>There's something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do
you know what would be the best thing to do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pay back the three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan
will give you another thousand&mdash;that makes three. Take it and pay
it back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when would you get it, your three thousand? You're not
of age, besides, and you must&mdash;you absolutely must&mdash;take my farewell
to her to-day, with the money or without it, for I can't drag
on any longer, things have come to such a pass. To-morrow is too
late. I shall send you to father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.</q>
</p>

<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>

<p>
<q>But, Mitya, he won't give it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As though he would! I know he won't. Do you know the
meaning of despair, Alexey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I've had it all from him,
I know that. But morally he owes me something, doesn't he? You
know he started with twenty-eight thousand of my mother's
money and made a hundred thousand with it. Let him give me
back only three out of the twenty-eight thousand, and he'll draw
my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many of his sins. For
that three thousand&mdash;I give you my solemn word&mdash;I'll make an
end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the
last time I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God
Himself sends him this chance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, he won't give it for anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know he won't. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially.
That's not all. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago,
perhaps only yesterday he found out for the first time <emph>in earnest</emph>
(underline <emph>in earnest</emph>) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking,
and really means to marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the
cat. And do you suppose he's going to give me money to help to
bring that about when he's crazy about her himself? And that's
not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I know that for the
last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank,
changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large envelope,
sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see
how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: <q>To my
angel, Grushenka, when she will come to me.</q> He scrawled it himself
in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money's there
except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now
he has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days; he
hopes she'll come for the money. He has sent her word of it, and
she has sent him word that perhaps she'll come. And if she does
go to the old man, can I marry her after that? You understand
now why I'm here in secret and what I'm on the watch for.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here.
Foma comes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
does jobs for them. He's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting
in the day-time; and that's how he lives. I've established myself
in his room. Neither he nor the women of the house know the
secret&mdash;that is, that I am on the watch here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was he told you about the money, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. It's a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn't know about the
money, or anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya
on a two or three days' journey. A purchaser has turned up for
the copse: he'll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old
man keeps asking Ivan to help him by going to arrange it. It will
take him two or three days. That's what the old man wants, so
that Grushenka can come while he's away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he's expecting Grushenka to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't come to-day; there are signs. She's certain not
to come,</q> cried Mitya suddenly. <q>Smerdyakov thinks so, too.
Father's drinking now. He's sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him,
Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, dear, what's the matter with you?</q> cried Alyosha, jumping
up from his place, and looking keenly at his brother's frenzied
face. For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was
mad.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it? I'm not insane,</q> said Dmitri, looking intently and
earnestly at him. <q>No fear. I am sending you to father, and I
know what I'm saying. I believe in miracles.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In miracles?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He
sees my despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won't let
something awful happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I know it will take some time. You can't go at him point
blank. He's drunk now. I'll wait three hours&mdash;four, five, six,
seven. Only remember you must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if
it has to be at midnight, <emph>with the money or without the money</emph>,
and say, <q>He sends his compliments to you.</q> I want you to say that
verse to her: <q>He sends his compliments to you.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>

<p>
<q>Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-day&mdash;if not to-day,
to-morrow, or the next day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And if&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If there's an if, it will be murder. I couldn't endure it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who will be murdered?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The old man. I shan't kill her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, what are you saying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I don't know.... I don't know. Perhaps I shan't kill,
and perhaps I shall. I'm afraid that he will suddenly become so
loathsome to me with his face at that moment. I hate his ugly
throat, his nose, his eyes, his shameless snigger. I feel a physical
repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of. That's what may be too
much for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best,
that nothing awful may happen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn't
come to pass&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his father's house.

<head>Chapter VI. Smerdyakov</head>

<p>
He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was
a dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the
drawing-room, which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned
ostentation. The furniture was white and very old, upholstered
in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the
windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of
old-fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper,
which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits&mdash;one
of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty
years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In
the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which
a lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional
purposes as to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to
<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>
bed very late, at three or four o'clock in the morning, and would
wander about the room at night or sit in an arm-chair, thinking.
This had become a habit with him. He often slept quite alone in
the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov
remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.
</p>

<p>
When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves
had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with
brandy after dinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The
servants, Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the
gentlemen and the servants seemed in singularly good spirits. Fyodor
Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter. Before he entered the
room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so well, and could
tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached the good-humored
stage, and was far from being completely drunk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here he is! Here he is!</q> yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted
at seeing Alyosha. <q>Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten
dish, but it's hot and good. I don't offer you brandy, you're keeping
the fast. But would you like some? No; I'd better give you
some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the
second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look sharp!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.
