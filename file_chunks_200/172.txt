</p>

<p>
Alyosha kissed her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, now go. Christ be with you!</q> and she made the sign
of the cross over him. <q>Make haste back to <emph>him</emph> while he is alive.
I see I've kept you cruelly. I'll pray to-day for him and you.
Alyosha, we shall be happy! Shall we be happy, shall we?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe we shall, Lise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov
and was going out of the house without saying good-by to her. But
no sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov
standing before him. From the first word Alyosha guessed that
she had been waiting on purpose to meet him.
</p>

<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense
and ridiculous. I trust you won't dream&mdash;It's foolishness,
nothing but foolishness!</q> she said, attacking him at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only don't tell her that,</q> said Alyosha, <q>or she will be upset,
and that's bad for her now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand
that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid
state, because you didn't want to irritate her by contradiction?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,</q> Alyosha
declared stoutly.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the
first place I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her
away, you may be sure of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why?</q> asked Alyosha. <q>It's all so far off. We may have
to wait another year and a half.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that's true, of course, and you'll have
time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half.
But I am so unhappy! Though it's such nonsense, it's a great blow
to me. I feel like Famusov in the last scene of <hi rend='italic'>Sorrow from Wit</hi>.
You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya, and, only fancy, I've run down
to meet you on the stairs, and in the play the fatal scene takes place
on the staircase. I heard it all; I almost dropped. So this is the
explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late! It
means love to the daughter but death to the mother. I might as
well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still, what
is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, there's no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now?
I must know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her
aunts are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves
airs. Herzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn't know
what to do for him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him.
He was driven home in my carriage. And on the top of it all, you
and this letter! It's true nothing can happen for a year and a half.
In the name of all that's holy, in the name of your dying elder,
show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I'm her mother. Hold
it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I won't show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>
wouldn't. I am coming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk
over many things, but now good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.

<head>Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar</head>

<p>
He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying
good-by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must
attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently
keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three
o'clock. Alyosha's whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying
saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything.
The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to
happen grew stronger in Alyosha's mind with every hour. What
that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to
his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. <q>Even if
my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won't have to reproach
myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved
something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do
as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.</q>
</p>

<p>
His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over
the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in
the summer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha,
he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house,
but would remain hidden in the summer-house, even if he had to
wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for
Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer-house.
Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details
of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting
back to the monastery that day.
</p>

<p>
Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the
hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the
summer-house unseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman
of the house and Foma too, if he were here, might be loyal to his
brother and obey his instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>
into the garden, or might warn Dmitri that he was being sought and
inquired for.
</p>

<p>
There was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and
began to wait. He looked round the summer-house, which somehow
struck him as a great deal more ancient than before. Though
the day was just as fine as yesterday, it seemed a wretched little
place this time. There was a circle on the table, left no doubt from
the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before. Foolish and
irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do in a time
of tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat
down precisely in the same place as before, why not in the other
seat. At last he felt very depressed&mdash;depressed by suspense and
uncertainty. But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an
hour, when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite
close. People were sitting, or had only just sat down, somewhere
in the bushes not more than twenty paces away. Alyosha suddenly
recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the day before,
he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among the
bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it
now. Who were they?
</p>

<p>
A man's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying
himself on the guitar:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>With invincible force</l>
<l>I am bound to my dear.</l>
<l>O Lord, have mercy</l>
<l>On her and on me!</l>
<l>On her and on me!</l>
<l>On her and on me!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
The voice ceased. It was a lackey's tenor and a lackey's song. Another
voice, a woman's, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully,
though with mincing affectation:
</p>

<p>
<q>Why haven't you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch?
Why do you always look down upon us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all,</q> answered a man's voice politely, but with emphatic
dignity. It was clear that the man had the best of the position,
and that the woman was making advances. <q>I believe the man
must be Smerdyakov,</q> thought Alyosha, <q>from his voice. And
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>
the lady must be the daughter of the house here, who has come
from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tail and goes
to Marfa for soup.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,</q> the
woman's voice continued. <q>Why don't you go on?</q>
</p>

<p>
The man sang again:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>What do I care for royal wealth</l>
<l>If but my dear one be in health?</l>
<l>Lord have mercy</l>
<l>On her and on me!</l>
<l>On her and on me!</l>
<l>On her and on me!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q>It was even better last time,</q> observed the woman's voice.
<q>You sang <q>If my darling be in health</q>; it sounded more tender.
I suppose you've forgotten to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Poetry is rubbish!</q> said Smerdyakov curtly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So far as it's poetry, it's essential rubbish. Consider yourself,
who ever talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme,
even though it were decreed by government, we shouldn't say
much, should we? Poetry is no good, Marya Kondratyevna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How clever you are! How is it you've gone so deep into everything?</q>
The woman's voice was more and more insinuating.
</p>

<p>
<q>I could have done better than that. I could have known more
than that, if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up.
I would have shot a man in a duel if he called me names because I
am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father. And they
used to throw it in my teeth in Moscow. It had reached them from
here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch. Grigory Vassilyevitch blames
me for rebelling against my birth, but I would have sanctioned their
killing me before I was born that I might not have come into the
world at all. They used to say in the market, and your mamma too,
with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hair was like
a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a wee bit.
Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said <q>a little bit,</q> like
every one else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular peasant's
feeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>
an educated man? He can't be said to have feeling at all, in his
ignorance. From my childhood up when I hear <q>a wee bit,</q> I am
ready to burst with rage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you'd been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you
wouldn't have talked like that, but would have drawn your saber to
defend all Russia.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what's
more, I should like to abolish all soldiers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion
of Russia by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the
present one, and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered
us. A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid one
and annexed it. We should have had quite different institutions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are they so much better in their own country than we are?
I wouldn't change a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,</q>
observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her
words with a most languishing glance.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's as one prefers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are just like a foreigner&mdash;just like a most gentlemanly
foreigner. I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike
in their vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears
polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it.
The Russian people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very
truly yesterday, though he is mad, and all his children.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be
unruly. He is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket,
I would have left here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower
than any lackey in his behavior, in his mind, and in his poverty.
He doesn't know how to do anything, and yet he is respected by
every one. I may be only a soup-maker, but with luck I could open
a café restaurant in Petrovka, in Moscow, for my cookery is something
special, and there's no one in Moscow, except the foreigners,
whose cookery is anything special. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar,
but if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country,
<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>
he'd fight him. Though in what way is he better than I am? For
he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has
wasted without any need!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be lovely, a duel,</q> Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young
officers with pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake
of some lady. A perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to
look on, I'd give anything to see one!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he
is firing straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You'd
be glad to run away, Marya Kondratyevna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't mean you would run away?</q> But Smerdyakov did
not deign to reply. After a moment's silence the guitar tinkled
again, and he sang again in the same falsetto:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Whatever you may say,</l>
<l>I shall go far away.</l>
<l>Life will be bright and gay</l>
<l>In the city far away.</l>
<l>I shall not grieve,</l>
<l>I shall not grieve at all,</l>
<l>I don't intend to grieve at all.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
Then something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly
sneezed. They were silent. Alyosha got up and walked towards
them. He found Smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots,
his hair pomaded, and perhaps curled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat.
His companion was the daughter of the house, wearing a
light-blue dress with a train two yards long. She was young and
would not have been bad-looking, but that her face was so round
and terribly freckled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?</q> asked Alyosha with as
much composure as he could.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.
</p>

<p>
<q>How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It's not as if I
were his keeper,</q> answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and
superciliously.
</p>

<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>

<p>
<q>But I simply asked whether you do know?</q> Alyosha explained.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know nothing of his whereabouts and don't want to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes
on in the house, and promised to let him know when Agrafena
Alexandrovna comes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an
hour ago?</q> he asked, looking at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight
to the summer-house. I hope you'll forgive me,</q> he added, addressing
Marya Kondratyevna. <q>I was in a hurry to find my brother.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!</q> drawled Marya
Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha's apology. <q>For Dmitri Fyodorovitch
often goes to the summer-house in that way. We don't
know he is here and he is sitting in the summer-house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is
now. Believe me, it's on business of great importance to him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He never tells us,</q> lisped Marya Kondratyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Though I used to come here as a friend,</q> Smerdyakov began
again, <q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way
even here by his incessant questions about the master. <q>What news?</q>
he'll ask. <q>What's going on in there now? Who's coming and going?</q>
and can't I tell him something more. Twice already he's
threatened me with death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With death?</q> Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you suppose he'd think much of that, with his temper,
which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says
if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I'll
be the first to suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I
were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police
know. God only knows what he might not do!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His honor said to him the other day, <q>I'll pound you in a mortar!</q></q>
added Marya Kondratyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,</q> observed
Alyosha. <q>If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that
too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,</q> said Smerdyakov, as
though thinking better of it; <q>I am here as an old friend and neighbor,
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>
and it would be odd if I didn't come. On the other hand, Ivan
Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother's
lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to
Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here, in
the market-place. I went, but didn't find Dmitri Fyodorovitch
at home, though it was eight o'clock. <q>He's been here, but he is
quite gone,</q> those were the very words of his landlady. It's as
though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this
moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan
Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch
dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you
most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you,
for he'd kill me for nothing at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?</q> repeated
Alyosha quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Metropolis tavern in the market-place?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The very same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's quite likely,</q> cried Alyosha, much excited. <q>Thank you,
Smerdyakov; that's important. I'll go there at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't betray me,</q> Smerdyakov called after him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, I'll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don't
be anxious.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But wait a minute, I'll open the gate to you,</q> cried Marya
Kondratyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>No; it's a short cut, I'll get over the fence again.</q>
</p>

<p>
What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran
to the tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in
his monastic dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his
brothers and call them down. But just as he reached the tavern, a
window was flung open, and his brother Ivan called down to him
from it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, can't you come up here to me? I shall be awfully
grateful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I can, only I don't quite know whether in this
dress&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I'll run down
to meet you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/>

<p>
A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was
alone dining.
</p>

<p>
Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place
shut off by a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in
the room. It was the first room from the entrance with a buffet
along the wall. Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it.
The only customer in the room was an old retired military man
drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual bustle going on
in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for the waiters,
the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the drone of
the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this tavern
and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he
reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was
not there.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don't live on tea
alone, I suppose,</q> cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got
hold of Alyosha. He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,</q> said Alyosha
gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you
used to love cherry jam when you were little?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were
eleven, I was nearly fifteen. There's such a difference between
fifteen and eleven that brothers are never companions at those ages.
I don't know whether I was fond of you even. When I went away
to Moscow for the first few years I never thought of you at all.
Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we only met once somewhere,
I believe. And now I've been here more than three months,
and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I
am going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could
see you to say good-by and just then you passed.</q>
</p>

<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>

<p>
<q>Were you very anxious to see me, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you
to know me. And then to say good-by. I believe it's always best
to get to know people just before leaving them. I've noticed
how you've been looking at me these three months. There has been
a continual look of expectation in your eyes, and I can't endure that.
That's how it is I've kept away from you. But in the end I have
learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I thought.
Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don't you?
I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by,
even if they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes
ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant
eyes. You seem to love me for some reason, Alyosha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you&mdash;Ivan is a tomb! I
say of you, Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But
I understand something in you, and I did not understand it till this
morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that?</q> laughed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't be angry?</q> Alyosha laughed too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That you are just as young as other young men of three and
twenty, that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in
fact! Now, have I insulted you dreadfully?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,</q> cried Ivan,
warmly and good-humoredly. <q>Would you believe it that ever since
that scene with her, I have thought of nothing else but my youthful
greenness, and just as though you guessed that, you begin about
it. Do you know I've been sitting here thinking to myself: that if
I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith
in the order of things, were convinced in fact that everything is a
disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, if I were
struck by every horror of man's disillusionment&mdash;still I should
want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn
away from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure
to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away&mdash;where
I don't know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph
over everything&mdash;every disillusionment, every disgust with
life. I've asked myself many times whether there is in the world

any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly
thirst for life in me, and I've come to the conclusion that there
isn't, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of myself, I
fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists&mdash;and poets especially&mdash;often
call that thirst for life base. It's a feature of the Karamazovs,
it's true, that thirst for life regardless of everything; you have
it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal force on our
planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life,
and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in
the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they
open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one
loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great
deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in
them, yet from old habit one's heart prizes them. Here they have
brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It's first-rate
soup, they know how to make it here. I want to travel in Europe,
Alyosha, I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only
going to a graveyard, but it's a most precious graveyard, that's
what it is! Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over
them speaks of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith
in their work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I
know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep
over them; though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been
nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but
simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul
in my emotion. I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky&mdash;that's
all it is. It's not a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving
with one's inside, with one's stomach. One loves the first strength
of one's youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?</q>
Ivan laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one's inside,
with one's stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully
glad that you have such a longing for life,</q> cried Alyosha. <q>I
think every one should love life above everything in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Love life more than the meaning of it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be
regardless of logic, and it's only then one will understand the meaning
of it. I have thought so a long time. Half your work is done,
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
Ivan, you love life, now you've only to try to do the second half
and you are saved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what
does your second half mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died
after all. Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>professions de foi</foreign>
from such&mdash;novices. You are a steadfast person,
Alexey. Is it true that you mean to leave the monastery?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before
I am thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father
doesn't want to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams
of hanging on to eighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too
seriously, though he is a buffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he
stands on his sensuality&mdash;though after we are thirty, indeed, there
may be nothing else to stand on.... But to hang on to seventy is
nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain <q>a shadow of nobility</q>
by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, but I saw Smerdyakov,</q> and Alyosha rapidly, though
minutely, described his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began
listening anxiously and questioned him.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about
him,</q> added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you frowning on Smerdyakov's account?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see
Dmitri, but now there's no need,</q> said Ivan reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But are you really going so soon, brother?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?</q> asked Alyosha
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it?
Am I my brother Dmitri's keeper?</q> Ivan snapped irritably, but
then he suddenly smiled bitterly. <q>Cain's answer about his murdered
brother, wasn't it? Perhaps that's what you're thinking at this
moment? Well, damn it all, I can't stay here to be their keeper,
can I? I've finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you
imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I've been trying to steal his
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense,
I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished
it just now, you were witness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At Katerina Ivanovna's?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and I've released myself once for all. And after all, what
have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn't come in. I had my own
business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary,
that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding
between us. I didn't ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her
over to me and gave us his blessing. It's all too funny. Ah, Alyosha,
if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe,
it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne
to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It's been going
on nearly six months, and all at once I've thrown it off. I could
never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an
end to it if I wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are speaking of your love, Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I
worried myself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over
her ... and all at once it's collapsed! I spoke this morning with
inspiration, but I went away and roared with laughter. Would you
believe it? Yes, it's the literal truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem very merry about it now,</q> observed Alyosha, looking
into his face, which had suddenly grown brighter.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how could I tell that I didn't care for her a bit! Ha ha! It
appears after all I didn't. And yet how she attracted me! How
attractive she was just now when I made my speech! And do you
know she attracts me awfully even now, yet how easy it is to leave
her. Do you think I am boasting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, only perhaps it wasn't love.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>don't make reflections about love, it's
unseemly for you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning!
I've forgotten to kiss you for it.... But how she tormented
me! It certainly was sitting by a <q>laceration.</q> Ah, she knew how
I loved her! She loved me and not Dmitri,</q> Ivan insisted gayly.
<q>Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a self-laceration. All I told her
just now was perfectly true, but the worst of it is, it may take her
fifteen or twenty years to find out that she doesn't care for Dmitri,
<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>
and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she may never find
it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, it's better so; I can
simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What
happened after I departed?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now,
he heard, unconscious and delirious.
</p>

<p>
<q>Isn't Madame Hohlakov laying it on?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don't
matter. God gave woman hysterics as a relief. I won't go to her
at all. Why push myself forward again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you told her that she had never cared for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne?
Let us drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, brother, we had better not drink,</q> said Alyosha suddenly.
<q>Besides I feel somehow depressed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you've been depressed a long time, I've noticed it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Morning? I didn't say I should go in the morning.... But
perhaps it may be the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here
to-day only to avoid dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I
should have left long ago, so far as he is concerned. But why are
you so worried about my going away? We've plenty of time before
I go, an eternity!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an
eternity?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what does it matter to us?</q> laughed Ivan. <q>We've time
enough for our talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look
so surprised? Answer: why have we met here? To talk of my
love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man and Dmitri? of foreign
travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of the Emperor Napoleon?
Is that it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you know what for. It's different for other people; but
we in our green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of
all. That's what we care about. Young Russia is talking about
nothing but the eternal questions now. Just when the old folks are
all taken up with practical questions. Why have you been looking
<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>
at me in expectation for the last three months? To ask me, <q>What
do you believe, or don't you believe at all?</q> That's what your eyes
have been meaning for these three months, haven't they?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps so,</q> smiled Alyosha. <q>You are not laughing at me,
now, Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Me laughing! I don't want to wound my little brother who has
been watching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha,
look straight at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you
are, only not a novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up
till now, some of them, I mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance,
here, they meet and sit down in a corner. They've never
met in their lives before and, when they go out of the tavern, they
won't meet again for forty years. And what do they talk about in
that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions, of
the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe
in God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation
of all humanity on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same,
they're the same questions turned inside out. And masses, masses
of the most original Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal
questions! Isn't it so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, for real Russians the questions of God's existence and of
immortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out,
come first and foremost, of course, and so they should,</q> said Alyosha,
still watching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Alyosha, it's sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all,
but anything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time
one can hardly imagine. But there's one Russian boy called Alyosha
I am awfully fond of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How nicely you put that in!</q> Alyosha laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of
God, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father's that
there was no God.</q> Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and
I saw your eyes glow. But now I've no objection to discussing with
you, and I say so very seriously. I want to be friends with you,
Alyosha, for I have no friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy,
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
perhaps I too accept God,</q> laughed Ivan; <q>that's a surprise for you,
isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Joking? I was told at the elder's yesterday that I was joking.
You know, dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century
who declared that, if there were no God, he would have to be
invented. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>S'il n'existait
pas Dieu, il faudrait l'inventer.</foreign> And man
has actually invented God. And what's strange, what would be
marvelous, is not that God should really exist; the marvel is that
such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God, could enter the head
of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy it is, so touching,
so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me, I've long
resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And
I won't go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that
subject, all derived from European hypotheses; for what's a hypothesis
there, is an axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with
the boys but with their teachers too, for our Russian professors are
often just the same boys themselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses.
For what are we aiming at now? I am trying to explain as
quickly as possible my essential nature, that is what manner of
man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope, that's it, isn't it?
And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply. But you must
note this: if God exists and if He really did create the world, then,
as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of Euclid
and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions
in space. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers,
and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt
whether the whole universe, or to speak more widely the whole of
being, was only created in Euclid's geometry; they even dare to
dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never
meet on earth, may meet somewhere in infinity. I have come to the
conclusion that, since I can't understand even that, I can't expect
to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly that I have no
faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian earthly mind,
and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And
I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially
about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only
three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what's
more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose&mdash;which are utterly beyond
our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life;
I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day
be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving,
and Which Itself was <q>with God,</q> and Which Itself is God and so
on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of phrases for it. I
seem to be on the right path, don't I? Yet would you believe it, in
the final result I don't accept this world of God's, and, although I
know it exists, I don't accept it at all. It's not that I don't accept
God, you must understand, it's the world created by Him I don't
and cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that
suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity
of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage,
like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small
Euclidian mind of man, that in the world's finale, at the moment
of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass that it
will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for
the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, of all the blood they've
shed; that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify
all that has happened with men&mdash;but though all that may come to
pass, I don't accept it. I won't accept it. Even if parallel lines do
meet and I see it myself, I shall see it and say that they've met, but
still I won't accept it. That's what's at the root of me, Alyosha;
that's my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. I began our talk
as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I've led up to my confession,
for that's all you want. You didn't want to hear about God, but
only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so I've
told you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected
feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>And why did you begin <q>as stupidly as you could</q>?</q> asked
Alyosha, looking dreamily at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations
on such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly.
And secondly, the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The
stupider one is, the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless,
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>
while intelligence wriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave,
but stupidity is honest and straightforward. I've led the conversation
to my despair, and the more stupidly I have presented it, the
better for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will explain why you don't accept the world?</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I will, it's not a secret, that's what I've been leading
up to. Dear little brother, I don't want to corrupt you or to turn
you from your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.</q>
Ivan smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had
never seen such a smile on his face before.
</p>

<head>Chapter IV. Rebellion</head>

<p>
<q>I must make you one confession,</q> Ivan began. <q>I could
never understand how one can love one's neighbors. It's just
one's neighbors, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might
love those at a distance. I once read somewhere of John the Merciful,
a saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him, he
took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and began breathing into
his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease.
I am convinced that he did that from <q>self-laceration,</q> from
the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed
by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he
must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,</q> observed
Alyosha; <q>he, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many
people not practiced in love, from loving him. But yet there's a
great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ-like love. I know
that myself, Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and
the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question
is, whether that's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's
inherent in their nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men
is a miracle impossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods.
Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely. Another can never know
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>
how much I suffer, because he is another and not I. And what's
more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's suffering (as though
it were a distinction). Why won't he admit it, do you think?
Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I
once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading,
humiliating suffering such as humbles me&mdash;hunger, for
instance&mdash;my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you
come to higher suffering&mdash;for an idea, for instance&mdash;he will very
rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all
what he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so
he deprives me instantly of his favor, and not at all from badness
of heart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show
themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can
love one's neighbors in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at
close quarters it's almost impossible. If it were as on the stage, in
the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered
lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like
looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But
enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view.
I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had
better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces
the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be.
Still we'd better keep to the children, though it does weaken my case.
But, in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters,
even when they are dirty, even when they are ugly (I fancy, though,
children never are ugly). The second reason why I won't speak of
grown-up people is that, besides being disgusting and unworthy of
love, they have a compensation&mdash;they've eaten the apple and know
good and evil, and they have become <q>like gods.</q> They go on eating
it still. But the children haven't eaten anything, and are so far
innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and
you will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too,
suffer horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers' sins,
they must be punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple;
but that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for
the heart of man here on earth. The innocent must not suffer for
another's sins, and especially such innocents! You may be surprised
at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond of children, too. And observe,
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
cruel people, the violent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are
sometimes very fond of children. Children while they are quite little&mdash;up
to seven, for instance&mdash;are so remote from grown-up people;
they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew
a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar,
murdered whole families, including several children. But when he
was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his
time at his window, watching the children playing in the prison
yard. He trained one little boy to come up to his window and made
great friends with him.... You don't know why I am telling
you all this, Alyosha? My head aches and I am sad.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak with a strange air,</q> observed Alyosha uneasily, <q>as
though you were not quite yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,</q> Ivan went
on, seeming not to hear his brother's words, <q>told me about the
crimes committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria
through fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages,
murder, outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by
the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning
they hang them&mdash;all sorts of things you can't imagine. People
talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and
insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically
cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he can do.
He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were
able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, too;
cutting the unborn child from the mother's womb, and tossing
babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets
before their mothers' eyes. Doing it before the mothers' eyes
was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that
I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her
baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They've
planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh.
They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a
pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with glee,
holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in
the baby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn't it? By
the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, what are you driving at?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>

<p>
<q>I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he
has created him in his own image and likeness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just as he did God, then?</q> observed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q><q>It's wonderful how you can turn words,</q> as Polonius says in
<hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>,</q> laughed Ivan. <q rend='pre'>You turn my words against
me. Well, I am glad. Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him in his
image and likeness. You asked just now what I was driving at.
You see, I am fond of collecting certain facts, and, would you believe,
I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and
books, and I've already got a fine collection. The Turks, of course,
have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have specimens from
home that are even better than the Turks. You know we prefer
beating&mdash;rods and scourges&mdash;that's our national institution. Nailing
ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But
the rod and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be
taken from us. Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners
are more humane, or laws have been passed, so that they don't dare
to flog men now. But they make up for it in another way just as
national as ours. And so national that it would be practically impossible
among us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it,
since the religious movement began in our aristocracy. I have a
charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how,
quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed&mdash;a
young man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and
was converted to the Christian faith at the very scaffold. This
Richard was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six
by his parents to some shepherds on the Swiss mountains. They
brought him up to work for them. He grew up like a little wild
beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and scarcely
fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in
cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite
the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had
been given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity
of feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years,
like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash
given to the pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn't
even give him that, and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And
that was how he spent all his childhood and his youth, till he grew

up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief. The savage
began to earn his living as a day laborer in Geneva. He drank what
he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by killing and robbing
an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to death. They
are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was immediately
surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods, philanthropic
ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in
prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him,
worked upon him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly
confessed his crime. He was converted. He wrote to the
court himself that he was a monster, but that in the end God had
vouchsafed him light and shown grace. All Geneva was in excitement
about him&mdash;all philanthropic and religious Geneva. All the
aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to the prison,
kissed Richard and embraced him; <q>You are our brother, you have
found grace.</q> And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion,
<q>Yes, I've found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of
pigs' food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the
Lord.</q> <q>Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must
die. Though it's not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when
you coveted the pigs' food and were beaten for stealing it (which
was very wrong of you, for stealing is forbidden); but you've shed
blood and you must die.</q> And on the last day, Richard, perfectly
limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute: <q>This is my
happiest day. I am going to the Lord.</q> <q>Yes,</q> cry the pastors and
the judges and philanthropic ladies. <q>This is the happiest day of
your life, for you are going to the Lord!</q> They all walk or drive
to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold
they call to Richard: <q>Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou
hast found grace!</q> And so, covered with his brothers' kisses, Richard
is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to the guillotine. And
they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion, because he had found
grace. Yes, that's characteristic. That pamphlet is translated into
Russian by some Russian philanthropists of aristocratic rank and
evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed gratis for the enlightenment
