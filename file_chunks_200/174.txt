was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before, and there
was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when
he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and
was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new,
unknown future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though
he had great hopes, and great&mdash;too great&mdash;expectations from life, he
could not have given any definite account of his hopes, his expectations,
or even his desires.
</p>

<p>
Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown
certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him
was something quite different. <q>Is it loathing for my father's
house?</q> he wondered. <q>Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though
it's the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it....
No, it's not that either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and
the conversation I had with him? For so many years I've been
silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and all of a
sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.</q> It certainly might have
been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity&mdash;vexation
at having failed to express himself, especially with such a
being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly been reckoning.
No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but
yet that was not it, that was not it either. <q>I feel sick with depression
and yet I can't tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan tried <q>not to think,</q> but that, too, was no use. What made
his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of
casual, external character&mdash;he felt that. Some person or thing
seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes
obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy
with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice
it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes,
and removes the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous
one&mdash;some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief
on the floor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on.
</p>

<p>
At last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home,
and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed
what was fretting and worrying him.
</p>

<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>

<p>
On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying
the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him
Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it
was this man that his soul loathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly
and became clear. Just before, when Alyosha had been telling
him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had felt a sudden twinge
of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred responsive
anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had been
forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as
soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten
sensation began to obtrude itself again. <q>Is it possible that
a miserable, contemptible creature like that can worry me so much?</q>
he wondered, with insufferable irritation.
</p>

<p>
It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike
for the man, especially during the last few days. He had even
begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of
hatred for the creature. Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by
the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighborhood he had felt
quite differently. Then he had taken a marked interest in Smerdyakov,
and had even thought him very original. He had encouraged
him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a certain
incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not understand
what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon
the brain of <q>the contemplative.</q> They discussed philosophical
questions and even how there could have been light on the first
day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created on the fourth
day, and how that was to be understood. But Ivan soon saw that,
though the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting subject, yet
that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov, and that he was looking
for something altogether different. In one way and another, he
began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too, and
that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later
on, there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on
the scene, and there had been the scandals with his brother Dmitri&mdash;they
discussed that, too. But though Smerdyakov always talked
of that with great excitement, it was impossible to discover what
he desired to come of it. There was, in fact, something surprising
in the illogicality and incoherence of some of his desires, accidentally
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
betrayed and always vaguely expressed. Smerdyakov was always
inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously premeditated questions,
but what his object was he did not explain, and usually at the
most important moment he would break off and relapse into silence
or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most
and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity
which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly.
Not that he forgot himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always
spoke very respectfully, yet he had obviously begun to consider&mdash;goodness
knows why!&mdash;that there was some sort of understanding
between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always spoke in a tone
that suggested that those two had some kind of compact, some secret
between them, that had at some time been expressed on both sides,
only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around
them. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of
his growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the
root of it.
</p>

<p>
With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at
the gate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov
rose from the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew
instantly that he wanted particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked
at him and stopped, and the fact that he did stop, instead of passing
by, as he meant to the minute before, drove him to fury. With
anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov's emasculate, sickly
face, with the little curls combed forward on his forehead. His
left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, <q>Where are you going?
You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have something
to say to each other.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan shook. <q>Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with
you?</q> was on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment
he heard himself say, <q>Is my father still asleep, or has he
waked?</q>
</p>

<p>
He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise,
and at once, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For
an instant he felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards.
Smerdyakov stood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking
at him with assurance and almost severity.
</p>

<p>
<q>His honor is still asleep,</q> he articulated deliberately (<q>You were
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
the first to speak, not I,</q> he seemed to say). <q>I am surprised at you,
sir,</q> he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his
right foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you surprised at me?</q> Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly,
doing his utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing,
with disgust, that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not,
on any account, have gone away without satisfying it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?</q> Smerdyakov suddenly
raised his eyes and smiled familiarly. <q>Why I smile you must
understand of yourself, if you are a clever man,</q> his screwed-up
left eye seemed to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should I go to Tchermashnya?</q> Ivan asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was silent again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,</q> he said at
last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his answer.
<q>I put you off with a secondary reason,</q> he seemed to suggest,
<q>simply to say something.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn you! Speak out what you want!</q> Ivan cried angrily
at last, passing from meekness to violence.
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up,
but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Substantially nothing&mdash;but just by way of conversation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute.
Ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov
stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether
he would be angry or not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last
he moved to get up. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how
to help myself,</q> he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last
word he sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little
children,</q> Smerdyakov went on. <q>I am speaking of your parent
and your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch
will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute, <q>Has she
come? Why hasn't she come?</q> and so on up till midnight and even
after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn't come (for
very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he will be at me
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
again to-morrow morning, <q>Why hasn't she come? When will she
come?</q>&mdash;as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it's
no better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother
will appear with his gun in his hands: <q>Look out, you rogue, you
soup-maker. If you miss her and don't let me know she's been&mdash;I'll
kill you before any one.</q> When the night's over, in the morning,
he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death. <q>Why
hasn't she come? Will she come soon?</q> And he, too, thinks me to
blame because his lady hasn't come. And every day and every
hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall
kill myself in a fright. I can't depend upon them, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for
Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q> said Ivan irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven't meddled
at all, if you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet
from the very beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on
me to be his servant. He has had only one thing to say since: <q>I'll
kill you, you scoundrel, if you miss her,</q> I feel certain, sir, that I
shall have a long fit to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>a long fit</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A long fit, lasting a long time&mdash;several hours, or perhaps a day
or two. Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret
that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for
three days I couldn't come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch
sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head
and tried another remedy, too.... I might have died.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming.
What makes you say you will have one to-morrow?</q> Ivan inquired,
with a peculiar, irritable curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just so. You can't tell beforehand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Besides, you fell from the garret then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret
again to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps.
I have to go into the cellar every day, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took a long look at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand
you,</q> he said softly, but with a sort of menace. <q>Do you mean to
pretend to be ill to-morrow for three days, eh?</q>
</p>

<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>

<p>
Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing
with the toe of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one
forward, and, grinning, articulated:
</p>

<p>
<q>If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit&mdash;and
it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them&mdash;I
should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from
death. For even if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father
while I am ill, his honor can't blame a sick man for not telling him.
He'd be ashamed to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hang it all!</q> Ivan cried, his face working with anger, <q>why
are you always in such a funk for your life? All my brother
Dmitri's threats are only hasty words and mean nothing. He won't
kill you; it's not you he'll kill!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He'd kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that,
I am afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does
something crazy to his father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should you be taken for an accomplice?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the
signals as a great secret.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more
plainly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm bound to admit the fact,</q> Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic
composure, <q>that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in
this business. As you know yourself (if only you do know it) he
has for several days past locked himself in as soon as night or even
evening comes on. Of late you've been going upstairs to your room
early every evening, and yesterday you did not come down at all,
and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he has begun to lock
himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the
door he won't open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory
Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his
room now. That's the arrangement he made himself ever since this
to-do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his
orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don't get to sleep till midnight,
but am on the watch, getting up and walking about the yard,
waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come. For the last few
days he's been perfectly frantic expecting her. What he argues is,
she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he calls him),
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
<q>and so,</q> says he, <q>she'll come the back-way, late at night, to me.
You look out for her,</q> says he, <q>till midnight and later; and if she
does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window
from the garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then
three times more quickly, then,</q> says he, <q>I shall understand at once
that she has come, and will open the door to you quietly.</q> Another
signal he gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At first,
two knocks, and then, after an interval, another much louder.
Then he will understand that something has happened suddenly and
that I must see him, and he will open to me so that I can go and
speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't come
herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might
come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully
afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna
had come and were locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch
were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should be bound
to let him know at once, knocking three times. So that the first
signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, while
the second signal of three knocks means <q>something important to tell
you.</q> His honor has shown me them several times and explained
them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of these signals
but myself and his honor, so he'd open the door without the slightest
hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of calling
out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch
too, now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you
tell him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it
back from him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day,
<q>You are deceiving me, you are hiding something from me! I'll
break both your legs for you.</q> So I told him those secret signals that
he might see my slavish devotion, and might be satisfied that I was
not deceiving him, but was telling him all I could.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you think that he'll make use of those signals and try to get
in, don't let him in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him
coming in then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate
he is?</q>
</p>

<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>

<p>
<q>Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit,
confound you? Are you laughing at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor
with this fear on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a
presentiment. Fright alone will bring it on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch.
Let Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the
signals without orders from my master. And as for Grigory
Vassilyevitch hearing him and not admitting him, he has been ill
ever since yesterday, and Marfa Ignatyevna intends to give him
medicine to-morrow. They've just arranged it. It's a very strange
remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a preparation and
always keeps it. It's a strong thing made from some herb. She
has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch
three times a year when his lumbago's so bad he is almost paralyzed
by it. Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his
whole back for half an hour till it's quite red and swollen, and what's
left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but
not quite all, for on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and
drinks it herself. And as they never take strong drink, I assure you
they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a very long time.
And when Grigory Vassilyevitch wakes up he is perfectly well after
it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a headache from it. So, if
Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention to-morrow, they won't
hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They'll be asleep.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though
it were planned. You'll have a fit and they'll both be unconscious,</q>
cried Ivan. <q>But aren't you trying to arrange it so?</q> broke from
him suddenly, and he frowned threateningly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on
Dmitri Fyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything,
he'll do it; but if not, I shan't be thrusting him upon his
father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you
say yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won't come at all?</q> Ivan
went on, turning white with anger. <q>You say that yourself, and all
the while I've been here, I've felt sure it was all the old man's fancy,
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
and the creature won't come to him. Why should Dmitri break in
on him if she doesn't come? Speak, I want to know what you are
thinking!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know yourself why he'll come. What's the use of what I
think? His honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious
on account of my illness perhaps, and he'll dash in, as he did
yesterday through impatience to search the rooms, to see whether
she hasn't escaped him on the sly. He is perfectly well aware,
too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big envelope with three thousand
roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed with three seals. On
it is written in his own hand, <q>To my angel Grushenka, if she will
come,</q> to which he added three days later, <q>for my little chicken.</q>
There's no knowing what that might do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q> cried Ivan, almost beside himself. <q>Dmitri won't
come to steal money and kill my father to do it. He might have
killed him yesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic,
savage fool he is, but he won't steal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is in very great need of money now&mdash;the greatest need, Ivan
Fyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he is,</q> Smerdyakov
explained, with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. <q>He
looks on that three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself.
<q>My father still owes me just three thousand,</q> he said. And
besides that, consider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something else
perfectly true. It's as good as certain, so to say, that Agrafena
Alexandrovna will force him, if only she cares to, to marry her&mdash;the
master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch&mdash;if only she cares to,
and of course she may care to. All I've said is that she won't come,
but maybe she's looking for more than that&mdash;I mean to be mistress
here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing
with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all
a stupid thing to do. And she's got plenty of sense. She wouldn't
marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into
consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri
Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
would have anything after the master's death, not a rouble, for
Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply to get hold of the
whole, all the money there is. But if your father were to die now,
there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for Dmitri Fyodorovitch
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
whom he hates so, for he's made no will.... Dmitri Fyodorovitch
knows all that very well.</q>
</p>

<p>
A sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He suddenly flushed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then why on earth,</q> he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, <q>do
you advise me to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by
that? If I go away, you see what will happen here.</q> Ivan drew
his breath with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely so,</q> said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching
Ivan intently, however.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>precisely so</q>?</q> Ivan questioned him,
with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place
I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a
position,</q> answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking
at Ivan's flashing eyes. They were both silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more ... an awful
scoundrel, too.</q> Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about
to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to
Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden
paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute,
would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway,
noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the
moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned
in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know&mdash;early
to-morrow morning. That's all!</q> he suddenly said aloud
angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to
say this then to Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's the best thing you can do,</q> he responded, as though he
had expected to hear it; <q>except that you can always be telegraphed
for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov.
But a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and
carelessness had completely disappeared. His face expressed attention
and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Haven't you something more to say&mdash;something to add?</q> could
be read in the intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.
</p>

<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>

<p>
<q>And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too&mdash;in case
anything happened?</q> Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown
reason raising his voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,</q> Smerdyakov
muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but
gazing intently into Ivan's eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to
save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out
of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Precisely so ...</q> muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice.
He looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to
draw back. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and
went through the gate still laughing. Any one who had seen his
face at that moment would have known that he was not laughing
from lightness of heart, and he could not have explained himself
what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked as
though in a nervous frenzy.

And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor
Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he went in, he
shouted to him, waving his hands, <q>I am going upstairs to my room,
not in to you. Good-by!</q> and passed by, trying not even to look
at his father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at
that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a
surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently
wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in
the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he
stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going
upstairs, till he passed out of sight.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with him?</q> he promptly asked Smerdyakov,
who had followed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Angry about something. Who can tell?</q> the valet muttered
evasively.
</p>

<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>

<p>
<q>Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar,
and get along with you. Look sharp! No news?</q>
</p>

<p>
Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just
complained of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these
questions we will omit. Half an hour later the house was locked,
and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms in
excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks agreed
upon. Now and then he peered out into the darkness, seeing nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat
up late that night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an account
of his thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that
soul&mdash;its turn will come. And even if one tried, it would be very
hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts in his
brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense excitement.
He felt himself that he had lost his bearings. He was fretted, too,
by all sorts of strange and almost surprising desires; for instance,
after midnight he suddenly had an intense irresistible inclination to
go down, open the door, go to the lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But
if he had been asked why, he could not have given any exact reason,
except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one who had insulted him
more gravely than any one in the world. On the other hand, he was
more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating
terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical
powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred
was rankling in his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on
some one. He even hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had
just had with him. At moments he hated himself intensely. Of
Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot to think, and wondered greatly
at this afterwards, especially as he remembered perfectly that when
he had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he would
go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his
heart, <q>That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy
to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with
peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and
had stealthily, as though he were afraid of being watched, opened the
door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>
stirring down below, had listened a long while&mdash;some five minutes&mdash;with
a sort of strange curiosity, holding his breath while his heart
throbbed. And why he had done all this, why he was listening, he
could not have said. That <q>action</q> all his life afterwards he called
<q>infamous,</q> and at the bottom of his heart, he thought of it as the
basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he felt no
hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious to know
how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing
now. He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of
the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room, listening,
listening&mdash;for some one to knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs
twice to listen like this.
</p>

<p>
About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor
Pavlovitch had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved
to fall asleep at once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did
fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked
early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight. Opening his
eyes, he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous. He
jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then dragged out his trunk
and began packing immediately. His linen had come back from
the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at the
thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his
departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before
(to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was
leaving next day, yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure
when he went to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his
first act in the morning would be to pack his trunk. At last his
trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine o'clock when Marfa
Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, <q>Where will your
honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?</q> He looked
almost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and
gestures, something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father
affably, and even inquiring specially after his health, though he did
not wait to hear his answer to the end, he announced that he was
starting off in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged
him to send for the horses. His father heard this announcement
with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an unmannerly way to show
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>
regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew into a great
flutter at the recollection of some important business of his own.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never
mind; we'll manage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear
boy. Go to Tchermashnya on the way. It's only to turn to the
left from the station at Volovya, only another twelve versts and
you come to Tchermashnya.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the train
starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night. I can only just catch
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off
to Tchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humor your
father! If I hadn't had something to keep me here, I would have
run over myself long ago, for I've some business there in a hurry.
But here I ... it's not the time for me to go now.... You see,
I've two pieces of copse land there. The Maslovs, an old merchant
and his son, will give eight thousand for the timber. But last year
I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve. There's no
getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have it all their
own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here dare
bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday
that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up.
What makes him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is
not afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand
for the copse. Do you hear? But he'll only be here, the priest
writes, for a week altogether, so you must go at once and make a
bargain with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you write to the priest; he'll make the bargain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He can't do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect
treasure, I'd give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without
a receipt; but he has no eye for business, he is a perfect child,
a crow could deceive him. And yet he is a learned man, would you
believe it? This Gorstkin looks like a peasant, he wears a blue
kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That's the common complaint.
He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he
is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife was dead
and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>
was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is
alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you
have to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when
he says he wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the
signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin. I've done business
with him a long time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has
a nasty, thin, red beard. If his beard shakes when he talks and he
gets cross, it's all right, he is saying what he means, he wants to
do business. But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins&mdash;he
is trying to cheat you. Don't watch his eyes, you won't find
out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a rogue&mdash;but watch his
beard! I'll give you a note and you show it to him. He's called
Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy<note place='foot'>i.e.
setter dog.</note>; but don't call him so,
he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and
see it's all right, write here at once. You need only write: <q>He's not
lying.</q> Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock
off, but not more. Just think! there's a difference between eight
thousand and eleven thousand. It's as good as picking up three
thousand; it's not so easy to find a purchaser, and I'm in desperate
need of money. Only let me know it's serious, and I'll run over and
fix it up. I'll snatch the time somehow. But what's the good of my
galloping over, if it's all a notion of the priest's? Come, will you
go?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I can't spare the time. You must excuse me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, you might oblige your father. I shan't forget it. You've
no heart, any of you&mdash;that's what it is? What's a day or two to
you? Where are you going now&mdash;to Venice? Your Venice will
keep another two days. I would have sent Alyosha, but what use
is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you just because you are a
clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You know nothing
about timber, but you've got an eye. All that is wanted is to
see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard&mdash;if
his beard shakes you know he is in earnest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself,
then?</q> cried Ivan, with a malignant smile.
</p>

<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy,
but he caught the smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you'll go, you'll go? I'll scribble the note for you at
once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether I shall go. I don't know. I'll decide on
the way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you
settle the matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he'll send
it on to me at once. And I won't delay you more than that. You
can go to Venice. The priest will give you horses back to Volovya
station.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent
for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When
Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but
to-day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he
did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and
seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this
particularly. <q>He must be bored with me,</q> he thought. Only
when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began
to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to
hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it
at once, and instantly pulled himself up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!</q> he repeated from the
steps. <q>You'll come again some time or other? Mind you do come.
I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan got into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Ivan! Don't be too hard on me!</q> the father called
for the last time.
</p>

<p>
The whole household came out to take leave&mdash;Smerdyakov, Marfa
and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated
himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,</q> broke suddenly
from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of
themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He
remembered it long after.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a true saying then, that <q>it's always worth while speaking to
a clever man,</q></q> answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly
at Ivan.
</p>

<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>

<p>
The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan's soul, but
he looked eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees,
at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all
of a sudden he felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver,
and he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him;
but a minute later he realized that he was not catching anything,
and that he had not really even taken in the peasant's answer. He
was silent, and it was pleasant even so. The air was fresh, pure and
cool, the sky bright. The images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna
floated into his mind. But he softly smiled, blew softly on the
friendly phantoms, and they flew away. <q>There's plenty of time
for them,</q> he thought. They reached the station quickly, changed
horses, and galloped to Volovya. <q>Why is it worth while speaking
to a clever man? What did he mean by that?</q> The thought
seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing. <q>And why did I tell
him I was going to Tchermashnya?</q> They reached Volovya station.
Ivan got out of the carriage, and the drivers stood round him bargaining
over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya. He
told them to harness the horses. He went into the station house,
looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife, and suddenly went
back to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway
by seven, brothers?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure. Mitri here will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father's, to Fyodor
Pavlovitch Karamazov, and tell him I haven't gone to Tchermashnya.
Can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And here's something for you, for I dare say he won't give you
anything,</q> said Ivan, laughing gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You may depend on it he won't.</q> Mitya laughed too. <q>Thank
you, sir. I'll be sure to do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow
<q>Away with the past. I've done with the old world for ever, and
may I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>
and no looking back!</q> But instead of delight his soul was filled
with such gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish, as he had
never known in his life before. He was thinking all the night.
The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching
Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a scoundrel,</q> he whispered to himself.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son
off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking
brandy. But suddenly something happened which was very
annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house, and completely
upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's equanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to
the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps.
Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the yard and heard him in
time. She did not see the fall, but heard his scream&mdash;the strange,
peculiar scream, long familiar to her&mdash;the scream of the epileptic
falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit had come on
him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he must have
fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had
caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them.
They found him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions
and foaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he
must have broken something&mdash;an arm or a leg&mdash;and hurt himself,
but <q>God had preserved him,</q> as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it&mdash;nothing
of the kind had happened. But it was difficult to get him
out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to help and managed it
somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole
ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man
did not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but
then began again, and every one concluded that the same thing
would happen, as had happened a year before, when he accidentally
fell from the garret. They remembered that ice had been put on
his head then. There was still ice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna
had some brought up. In the evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for
Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at once. He was a most estimable
old man, and the most careful and conscientious doctor in the
province. After careful examination, he concluded that the fit
was a very violent one and might have serious consequences; that
meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it, but that by
<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>
to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he
would venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the
lodge, to a room next to Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's.
</p>

<p>
Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put
up with that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the
soup, compared with Smerdyakov's, was <q>no better than dish-water,</q>
and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it.
To her master's bitter, though deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna
replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with, and
that she had never been trained as a cook. In the evening there
was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he was informed
that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days, was
completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his
tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house.
He was in terrible excitement and suspense. That evening he
reckoned on Grushenka's coming almost as a certainty. He had received
from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance <q>that she had
promised to come without fail.</q> The incorrigible old man's heart
throbbed with excitement; he paced up and down his empty rooms
listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch
for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov
had informed him two days before that he had told her where
and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not
be a second in the passage, for fear&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;that she
should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much
to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous
hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come!

<head>Book VI. The Russian Monk</head>

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors</head>

<p>
When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into
his elder's cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a
sick man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to
find him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and
exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by
visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation. But he
had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha's
arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier, waiting
for him to wake, having received a most confident assurance from
Father Païssy that <q>the teacher would get up, and as he had himself
promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his
heart.</q> This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder
Father Païssy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him unconscious,
if he had seen him breathe his last, and yet had his promise
that he would rise up and say good-by to him, he would not have
believed perhaps even in death, but would still have expected the
dead man to recover and fulfill his promise. In the morning as he
lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told him positively: <q>I shall
not die without the delight of another conversation with you, beloved
of my heart. I shall look once more on your dear face and
pour out my heart to you once again.</q> The monks, who had
gathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima,
had all been his devoted friends for many years. There were four
of them: Father Iosif and Father Païssy, Father Mihaïl, the warden
of the hermitage, a man not very old and far from being learned.
He was of humble origin, of strong will and steadfast faith, of
austere appearance, but of deep tenderness, though he obviously concealed
it as though he were almost ashamed of it. The fourth,
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>
Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little monk of the poorest
peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and very quiet, scarcely
speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble, and
looked as though he had been frightened by something great and
awful beyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a
great affection for this timorous man, and always treated him with
marked respect, though perhaps there was no one he had known to
whom he had said less, in spite of the fact that he had spent years
wandering about holy Russia with him. That was very long ago,
forty years before, when Father Zossima first began his life as a monk
in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, and when, shortly after,
he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to collect alms
for their poor monastery.
</p>

<p>
The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned
before, was very small, so that there was scarcely room for the four
of them (in addition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit
round Father Zossima on chairs brought from the sitting-room. It
was already beginning to get dark, the room was lighted up by the
lamps and the candles before the ikons.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father
Zossima smiled at him joyfully and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too.
I knew you would come.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground
and wept. Something surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering,
he wanted to sob.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, don't weep over me yet,</q> Father Zossima smiled, laying
his right hand on his head. <q>You see I am sitting up talking; maybe
I shall live another twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from
Vishegorye, with her little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday.
God bless the mother and the little girl Lizaveta,</q> he crossed himself.
<q>Porfiry, did you take her offering where I told you?</q>
</p>

<p>
He meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the
good-humored woman to be given <q>to some one poorer than me.</q>
Such offerings, always of money gained by personal toil, are made by
way of penance voluntarily undertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry
the evening before to a widow, whose house had been burnt down
lately, and who after the fire had gone with her children begging
<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>
alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had given the money, as he
had been instructed, <q>from an unknown benefactress.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Get up, my dear boy,</q> the elder went on to Alyosha. <q>Let me
look at you. Have you been home and seen your brother?</q> It
seemed strange to Alyosha that he asked so confidently and precisely,
about one of his brothers only&mdash;but which one? Then perhaps he
had sent him out both yesterday and to-day for the sake of that
brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have seen one of my brothers,</q> answered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day,</q> said
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Make haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste,
leave everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time
to prevent something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the
great suffering in store for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words
were strange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday,
exchanged glances with Father Païssy. Alyosha could not resist
asking:
</p>

<p>
<q>Father and teacher,</q> he began with extreme emotion, <q>your
words are too obscure.... What is this suffering in store for
him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as
though his whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look
came into his eyes&mdash;so that I was instantly horror-stricken at what
that man is preparing for himself. Once or twice in my life I've
seen such a look in a man's face ... reflecting as it were his future
fate, and that fate, alas, came to pass. I sent you to him, Alexey,
for I thought your brotherly face would help him. But everything
and all our fates are from the Lord. <q>Except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth
forth much fruit.</q> Remember that. You, Alexey, I've many times
silently blessed for your face, know that,</q> added the elder with a
gentle smile. <q>This is what I think of you, you will go forth from
these walls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have
many enemies, but even your foes will love you. Life will bring
you many misfortunes, but you will find your happiness in them,
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>
and will bless life and will make others bless it&mdash;which is what
matters most. Well, that is your character. Fathers and teachers,</q>
he addressed his friends with a tender smile, <q>I have never till to-day
told even him why the face of this youth is so dear to me. Now I
will tell you. His face has been as it were a remembrance and a
prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a child I had
an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And later on
in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that
brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For
had he not come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at
least, have become a monk and entered on this precious path. He
appeared first to me in my childhood, and here, at the end of my
pilgrimage, he seems to have come to me over again. It is marvelous,
fathers and teachers, that Alexey, who has some, though not
a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like him spiritually, that
many times I have taken him for that young man, my brother,
mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as a
reminder and an inspiration. So that I positively wondered at so
strange a dream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?</q> he turned to
the novice who waited on him. <q>Many times I've seen in your face
as it were a look of mortification that I love Alexey more than you.
Now you know why that was so, but I love you too, know that, and
many times I grieved at your mortification. I should like to tell
you, dear friends, of that youth, my brother, for there has been no
presence in my life more precious, more significant and touching.
My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at my whole life at this
moment as though living through it again.</q>

Here I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima
with the friends who visited him on the last day of his life has been
partly preserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote
it down from memory, some time after his elder's death. But
whether this was only the conversation that took place then, or
whether he added to it his notes of parts of former conversations
with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his account, Father
Zossima's talk goes on without interruption, as though he told his
life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt,
from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was
<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>
general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much,
yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides,
Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative,
for he was sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed
him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though he did not fall
asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once or twice the
conversation was interrupted by Father Païssy's reading the Gospel.
It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed that he would
die that night, for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in
the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept
him up through this long conversation. It was like a last effort of
love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little time, however,
for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that later.
I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the
account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be
shorter and not so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat,
Alyosha took a great deal from previous conversations and added
them to it.

Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in
the north, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth,
but of no great consequence or position. He died when I was only
two years old, and I don't remember him at all. He left my mother
a small house built of wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient
to keep her and her children in comfort. There were two of us,
my elder brother Markel and I. He was eight years older than I
was, of hasty irritable temperament, but kind-hearted and never
ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at home with me,
his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did not get
on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so my
mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was
seventeen, he made friends with a political exile who had been
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>
banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led a
solitary existence there. He was a good scholar who had gained
distinction in philosophy in the university. Something made him
take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see him. The
young man would spend whole evenings with him during that
winter, till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his
post again at his own request, as he had powerful friends.
</p>

<p>
It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was
rude and laughed at it. <q>That's all silly twaddle, and there is no
God,</q> he said, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too.
For though I was only nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words.
We had four servants, all serfs. I remember my mother selling one
of the four, the cook Afimya, who was lame and elderly, for sixty
paper roubles, and hiring a free servant to take her place.
</p>

<p>
In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and
had a tendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin
and delicate-looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose
he caught cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to
my mother that it was galloping consumption, that he would not
live through the spring. My mother began weeping, and, careful
not to alarm my brother, she entreated him to go to church, to confess
and take the sacrament, as he was still able to move about. This
made him angry, and he said something profane about the church.
He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he was seriously
ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him to
confess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a
long time past, that he was far from well, and had a year before
coolly observed at dinner to our mother and me, <q>My life won't be
long among you, I may not live another year,</q> which seemed now
like a prophecy.
