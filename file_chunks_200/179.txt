possible, that very morning.... You could pay me that three
thousand, for there isn't a capitalist in this town to compare with
you, and so would save me from ... would save me, in fact ...
for a good, I might say an honorable action.... For I cherish the
most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you know well,
and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it had
not been as a father. And, indeed, it's a struggle of three in this
<pb n='414'/><anchor id='Pg414'/>
business, for it's fate&mdash;that's a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch!
A tragedy, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you've dropped
out long ago, it's a tug-of-war between two. I'm expressing it awkwardly,
perhaps, but I'm not a literary man. You see, I'm on the
one side, and that monster on the other. So you must choose. It's
either I or the monster. It all lies in your hands&mdash;the fate of three
lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse me, I'm making a mess
of it, but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes that
you understand ... and if you don't understand, I'm done for ...
so you see!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, <q>so you see!</q> and
jumping up from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal.
At the last phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware
that it had all fallen flat, above all, that he had been talking utter
nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<q>How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and
now it's nothing but nonsense.</q> The idea suddenly dawned on his
despairing mind. All the while he had been talking, the old man
sat motionless, watching him with an icy expression in his eyes.
After keeping him for a moment in suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch
pronounced at last in the most positive and chilling tone:
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, we don't undertake such business.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?</q> he muttered, with
a pale smile. <q>I suppose it's all up with me&mdash;what do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed
a movement in the old man's face. He started.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line,</q> said the old
man slowly. <q>There's the court, and the lawyers&mdash;it's a perfect
misery. But if you like, there is a man here you might apply to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,</q>
faltered Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>He doesn't live here, and he's not here just now. He is a peasant,
he does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He's been
haggling with Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse
at Tchermashnya. They can't agree on the price, maybe you've
heard? Now he's come back again and is staying with the priest at
<pb n='415'/><anchor id='Pg415'/>
Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the Volovya station. He wrote
to me, too, about the business of the copse, asking my advice.
Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if you
were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy
the offer you've made me, he might possibly&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A brilliant idea!</q> Mitya interrupted ecstatically. <q>He's the very
man, it would just suit him. He's haggling with him for it, being
asked too much, and here he would have all the documents entitling
him to the property itself. Ha ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling
Samsonov.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?</q> cried Mitya effusively.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't mention it,</q> said Samsonov, inclining his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you don't know, you've saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment
brought me to you.... So now to this priest!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No need of thanks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll make haste and fly there. I'm afraid I've overtaxed your
strength. I shall never forget it. It's a Russian says that, Kuzma
Kuzmitch, a R-r-russian!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant
gleam in the old man's eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once
blamed himself for his mistrustfulness.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's because he's tired,</q> he thought.
</p>

<p>
<q>For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand
that it's for her,</q> he cried, his voice ringing through the room.
He bowed, turned sharply round, and with the same long stride
walked to the door without looking back. He was trembling with
delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel
saved me,</q> was the thought in his mind. And if such a business
man as Samsonov (a most worthy old man, and what dignity!)
had suggested this course, then ... then success was assured. He
would fly off immediately. <q>I will be back before night, I shall be
back at night and the thing is done. Could the old man have been
laughing at me?</q> exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards his lodging.
He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was
<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>
practical <q>from such a business man</q> with an understanding of the
business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!).
Or&mdash;the old man was laughing at him.
</p>

<p>
Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards,
when the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself
confessed, laughing, that he had made a fool of the <q>captain.</q> He
was a cold, spiteful and sarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies.
Whether it was the <q>captain's</q> excited face, or the foolish conviction
of the <q>rake and spendthrift,</q> that he, Samsonov, could be
taken in by such a cock-and-bull story as his scheme, or his jealousy
of Grushenka, in whose name this <q>scapegrace</q> had rushed in on
him with such a tale to get money which worked on the old man,
I can't tell. But at the instant when Mitya stood before him, feeling
his legs grow weak under him, and frantically exclaiming that
he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him with
intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. When
Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his
son and bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and
never admitted even into the yard, or else he'd&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw
him enraged, trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the
old man was shaking with anger, and by evening he was worse, and
sent for the doctor.
</p>

<p>
So he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for
horses. He had forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was
left after so many years of prosperity! But he had at home an old
silver watch which had long ceased to go. He snatched it up and
carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who had a shop in the market-place.
The Jew gave him six roubles for it.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I didn't expect that,</q> cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was
still in a state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home.
At home he borrowed three roubles from the people of the house,
<pb n='417'/><anchor id='Pg417'/>
who loved him so much that they were pleased to give it him, though
it was all they had. Mitya in his excitement told them on the spot
that his fate would be decided that day, and he described, in desperate
haste, the whole scheme he had put before Samsonov, the
latter's decision, his own hopes for the future, and so on. These
people had been told many of their lodger's secrets before, and so
looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud, and
almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles
Mitya sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station.
This was how the fact came to be remembered and established that
<q>at midday, on the day before the event, Mitya had not a farthing,
and that he had sold his watch to get money and had borrowed three
roubles from his landlord, all in the presence of witnesses.</q>
</p>

<p>
I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.
</p>

<p>
Though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would
at last solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station,
he trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in
his absence. What if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor
Pavlovitch? This was why he had gone off without telling her
and why he left orders with his landlady not to let out where he
had gone, if any one came to inquire for him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must, I must get back to-night,</q> he repeated, as he was jolted
along in the cart, <q>and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy
back here ... to draw up the deed.</q> So mused Mitya, with a
throbbing heart, but alas! his dreams were not fated to be carried
out.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya
station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve.
Secondly, he did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had
gone off to a neighboring village. While Mitya, setting off there
with the same exhausted horses, was looking for him, it was almost
dark.
</p>

<p>
The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him
at once that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he
was now at Suhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the
forester's cottage, as he was buying timber there too. At Mitya's
urgent request that he would take him to Lyagavy at once, and by
so doing <q>save him, so to speak,</q> the priest agreed, after some
<pb n='418'/><anchor id='Pg418'/>
demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his curiosity was obviously
aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on foot, as
it would not be <q>much over</q> a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed, and
marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost
ran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.
</p>

<p>
Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously
and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all
the way. The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He
turned off Mitya's questions with: <q>I don't know. Ah, I can't say.
How can I tell?</q> and so on. When Mitya began to speak of his
quarrel with his father over his inheritance, the priest was positively
alarmed, as he was in some way dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch.
He inquired, however, with surprise, why he called the peasant-trader
Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained to Mitya that,
though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he was never called so,
as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he must
be sure to call him Gorstkin, <q>or you'll do nothing with him; he
won't even listen to you,</q> said the priest in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that
that was what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the
priest dropped the subject, though he would have done well to put
into words his doubt whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that
peasant, calling him Lyagavy, there was not something wrong about
it and he was turning him into ridicule. But Mitya had no time
to pause over such trifles. He hurried, striding along, and only
when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize that they had come
not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three. This annoyed
him, but he controlled himself.
</p>

<p>
They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the
hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the
other side of the passage. They went into that room and lighted a
tallow candle. The hut was extremely overheated. On the table
there was a samovar that had gone out, a tray with cups, an empty
rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and some half-eaten crusts
of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched at full length
on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow,
snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I've
<pb n='419'/><anchor id='Pg419'/>
come in such haste. I'm in a hurry to get back to-day,</q> he said in
great agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not
giving their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake
him himself; he tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's drunk,</q> Mitya decided. <q>Good Lord! What am I to do?
What am I to do?</q> And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him
by the arms, by the legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making
him sit on the bench. Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only
succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and
violent, but inarticulate oaths.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you'd better wait a little,</q> the priest pronounced at last,
<q>for he's obviously not in a fit state.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's been drinking the whole day,</q> the forester chimed in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens!</q> cried Mitya. <q>If only you knew how important
it is to me and how desperate I am!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you'd better wait till morning,</q> the priest repeated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible!</q>
</p>

<p>
And in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping
man again, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his
efforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
</p>

<p>
<q>What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,</q> said Mitya,
in complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face.
The priest seized the moment to put before him, very reasonably,
that, even if he succeeded in wakening the man, he would still be
drunk and incapable of conversation. <q>And your business is important,</q>
he said, <q>so you'd certainly better put it off till morning.</q>
With a gesture of despair Mitya agreed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable
moment. As soon as he wakes I'll begin. I'll pay you for the light,</q>
he said to the forester, <q>for the night's lodging, too; you'll remember
Dmitri Karamazov. Only, Father, I don't know what we're to
do with you. Where will you sleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I'm going home. I'll take his horse and get home,</q> he
said, indicating the forester. <q>And now I'll say good-by. I wish
you all success.</q>
</p>

<p>
So it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester's horse, delighted
to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering
whether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>
Pavlovitch of this curious incident, <q>or he may in an unlucky hour
hear of it, be angry, and withdraw his favor.</q>
</p>

<p>
The forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without
a word, and Mitya sat on the bench to <q>catch the favorable moment,</q>
as he expressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul
like a heavy mist. A profound, intense dejection! He sat thinking,
but could reach no conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket
chirped; it became insufferably close in the overheated room. He
suddenly pictured the garden, the path behind the garden, the door
of his father's house mysteriously opening and Grushenka running
in. He leapt up from the bench.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a tragedy!</q> he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he
went up to the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean,
middle-aged peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long,
thin, reddish beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat,
from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch.
Mitya looked at his face with intense hatred, and for some unknown
reason his curly hair particularly irritated him.
</p>

<p>
What was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things
of such importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly
worn out, should with business of such urgency be standing over this
dolt on whom his whole fate depended, while he snored as though
there were nothing the matter, as though he'd dropped from another
planet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, the irony of fate!</q> cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head,
he fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a
sort of ferocity, pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but
after five minutes of vain exertions, he returned to his bench in
helpless despair, and sat down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stupid! Stupid!</q> cried Mitya. <q>And how dishonorable it all
is!</q> something made him add. His head began to ache horribly.
<q>Should he fling it up and go away altogether?</q> he wondered. <q>No,
wait till to-morrow now. I'll stay on purpose. What else did I
come for? Besides, I've no means of going. How am I to get away
from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!</q>
</p>

<p>
But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and
unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to
have slept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head
<pb n='421'/><anchor id='Pg421'/>
aching so unbearably that he could have screamed. There was a
hammering in his temples, and the top of his head ached. It was a
long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had
happened to him.
</p>

<p>
At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from
the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken
peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go
out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the
forester's room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that
the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance,
accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go
to see to it.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he's dead, he's dead! and ... what am I to do then?</q> cried
Mitya frantically.
</p>

<p>
They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney.
Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted
his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the
water, and put it on Lyagavy's head. The forester still treated the
matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said
grumpily:
</p>

<p>
<q>It'll be all right, now.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya
fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head,
and gravely resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out
that when he sat down for a moment to take breath, he closed his
eyes, unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and
slept like the dead.
</p>

<p>
It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about
nine o'clock. The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows
of the hut. The curly-headed peasant was sitting on the
bench and had his coat on. He had another samovar and another
bottle in front of him. Yesterday's bottle had already been finished,
and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya jumped up and
saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again, hopelessly and
incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened eyes.
The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting
composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so
Mitya fancied. He rushed up to him.
</p>

<pb n='422'/><anchor id='Pg422'/>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, you see ... I ... you've most likely heard from
the forester here in the hut. I'm Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov,
the son of the old Karamazov whose copse you are buying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a lie!</q> said the peasant, calmly and confidently.
</p>

<p>
<q>A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,</q> said the peasant,
speaking thickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do
wake up, and collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought
me here. You wrote to Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,</q>
Mitya gasped breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're l-lying!</q> Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya's legs
went cold.
</p>

<p>
<q>For mercy's sake! It isn't a joke! You're drunk, perhaps. Yet
you can speak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a painter!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For mercy's sake! I'm Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have
an offer to make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous
offer, concerning the copse!</q>
</p>

<p>
The peasant stroked his beard importantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you've contracted for the job and turned out a scamp.
You're a scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you you're mistaken,</q> cried Mitya, wringing his hands
in despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed
up his eyes cunningly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery.
D'you hear? You're a scoundrel! Do you understand that?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly <q>something seemed to
hit him on the head,</q> as he said afterwards. In an instant a light
seemed to dawn in his mind, <q>a light was kindled and I grasped it
all.</q> He stood, stupefied, wondering how he, after all a man of
intelligence, could have yielded to such folly, have been led into
such an adventure, and have kept it up for almost twenty-four
hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the man's drunk, dead drunk, and he'll go on drinking
now for a week; what's the use of waiting here? And what if
<pb n='423'/><anchor id='Pg423'/>
Samsonov sent me here on purpose? What if she&mdash;? Oh, God,
what have I done?</q>
</p>

<p>
The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya
might have killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a
child. He went quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it
on without a word, and went out of the hut. He did not find the
forester in the next room; there was no one there. He took fifty
kopecks in small change out of his pocket and put them on the
table for his night's lodging, the candle, and the trouble he had
given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all round.
He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the
hut, to the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before
with the priest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful
feeling for anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode
along a narrow forest path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where
he was going. A child could have knocked him down, so weak was
he in body and soul. He got out of the forest somehow, however,
and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest, stretched as far as the
eye could see.
</p>

<p>
<q>What despair! What death all round!</q> he repeated, striding
on and on.
</p>

<p>
He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven
across country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya
asked the way, and it turned out that the old merchant, too, was
going to Volovya. After some discussion Mitya got into the trap.
Three hours later they arrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered
posting-horses to drive to the town, and suddenly realized that he
was appallingly hungry. While the horses were being harnessed,
an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an instant, ate a
huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three glasses of
vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He
flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a
new and <q>unalterable</q> plan to procure that <q>accursed money</q> before
evening. <q>And to think, only to think that a man's life should
be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!</q> he cried, contemptuously.
<q>I'll settle it to-day.</q> And if it had not been for
the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her,
which never left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful
<pb n='424'/><anchor id='Pg424'/>
again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart
every moment, like a sharp knife.
</p>

<p>
At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.
</p>

</div>

<index index='toc'/>

<head>Chapter III. Gold-Mines</head>

<p>
This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to
Rakitin with such horror. She was just then expecting the
<q>message,</q> and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see
her that day or the day before. She hoped that <q>please God he won't
come till I'm gone away,</q> and he suddenly burst in on her. The
rest we know already. To get him off her hands she suggested at
once that he should walk with her to Samsonov's, where she said
she absolutely must go <q>to settle his accounts,</q> and when Mitya
accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, making
him promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her home again.
Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting
at Samsonov's she could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, <q>if
only she's not lying,</q> he added at once. But he thought she was
not lying from what he saw.
</p>

<p>
He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved
woman, at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be
happening to her, and how she may be betraying him, but, when
shaken, heartbroken, convinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to
her; at the first glance at her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate
face, he revives at once, lays aside all suspicion and with joyful
shame abuses himself for his jealousy.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he
had so much still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from
his heart, anyway.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov
whether anything happened there last night, whether, by any chance,
she went to Fyodor Pavlovitch; ough!</q> floated through his mind.
</p>

<p>
Before he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up
again in his restless heart.
</p>

<pb n='425'/><anchor id='Pg425'/>

<p>
Jealousy! <q>Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,</q> observed
Pushkin. And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight
of our great poet. Othello's soul was shattered and his whole
outlook clouded simply because <emph>his ideal was destroyed</emph>. But Othello
did not begin hiding, spying, peeping. He was trustful, on the
contrary. He had to be led up, pushed on, excited with great difficulty
before he could entertain the idea of deceit. The truly jealous
man is not like that. It is impossible to picture to oneself the shame
and moral degradation to which the jealous man can descend without
a qualm of conscience. And yet it's not as though the jealous
were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man of lofty
feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet hide
under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the lowest
ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.
</p>

<p>
Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness&mdash;not
incapable of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it&mdash;though
his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe's. It
is not so with the really jealous man. It is hard to imagine what
some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook, and
what they can forgive! The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive,
and all women know it. The jealous man can forgive extraordinarily
quickly (though, of course, after a violent scene), and he
is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved, the very
kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be convinced
that it has all been <q>for the last time,</q> and that his rival
will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the
earth, or that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that
dreaded rival will not get near her. Of course the reconciliation
is only for an hour. For, even if the rival did disappear next day,
he would invent another one and would be jealous of him. And one
might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so watched
over, what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous guarding.
But that the jealous will never understand. And yet among
them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those very
men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening
and spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment,
anyway, though they understand clearly enough with their <q>noble
hearts</q> the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.
</p>

<pb n='426'/><anchor id='Pg426'/>

<p>
At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya's jealousy vanished, and, for an
instant he became trustful and generous, and positively despised
himself for his evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love
for the woman, there was an element of something far higher than
he himself imagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only
the <q>curve of her body,</q> of which he had talked to Alyosha. But,
as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all
the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience
at it.
</p>

<p>
And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to
make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least
a small, temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost
all gone on his expedition. And, as we all know, one can't take a
step without money. But he had thought over in the cart where
he could get a loan. He had a brace of fine dueling pistols in a case,
which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above
all his possessions.
</p>

<p>
In the <q>Metropolis</q> tavern he had some time since made acquaintance
with a young official and had learnt that this very
opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons. He used to
buy pistols, revolvers, daggers, hang them on his wall and show them
to acquaintances. He prided himself on them, and was quite a
specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya, without stopping
to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his pistols
to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying to
persuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent,
so the young man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing
would induce him to take interest. They parted friends.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch's by
the back way, to his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as
possible. In this way the fact was established that three or four
hours before a certain event, of which I shall speak later on, Mitya
had not a farthing, and pawned for ten roubles a possession he
valued, though, three hours later, he was in possession of thousands....
But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna (the
woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch's) he learned the very disturbing
fact of Smerdyakov's illness. He heard the story of his
fall in the cellar, his fit, the doctor's visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch's
<pb n='427'/><anchor id='Pg427'/>
anxiety; he heard with interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set
off that morning for Moscow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,</q> thought
Dmitri, but he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. <q>What
will happen now? Who'll keep watch for me? Who'll bring me
word?</q> he thought. He began greedily questioning the women
whether they had seen anything the evening before. They quite
understood what he was trying to find out, and completely reassured
him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been
there the night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya
grew thoughtful. He would certainly have to keep watch to-day,
but where? Here or at Samsonov's gate? He decided that he must
be on the look out both here and there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile....
The difficulty was that he had to carry out the new
plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure of its
success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved to
sacrifice an hour to it: <q>In an hour I shall know everything, I shall
settle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov's. I'll
inquire whether Grushenka's there and instantly be back here again,
stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov's again to bring her home.</q>
This was what he decided.
</p>

<p>
He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes,
dressed, and went to Madame Hohlakov's. Alas! he had built his
hopes on her. He had resolved to borrow three thousand from that
lady. And what was more, he felt suddenly convinced that she
would not refuse to lend it to him. It may be wondered why, if he
felt so certain, he had not gone to her at first, one of his own sort,
so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he did not know, who
was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how to speak.
</p>

<p>
But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov
well, and had seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he
knew she could not endure him. She had detested him from the
first because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she had,
for some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna
should throw him over, and marry the <q>charming, chivalrously
refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.</q> Mitya's manners
she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had once said
about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was uncultivated.
<pb n='428'/><anchor id='Pg428'/>
But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck
him: <q>If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna</q>
(and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) <q>why
should she refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me
to leave Katya and get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine
ladies, if they set their hearts on anything, will spare no expense to
satisfy their caprice. Besides, she's so rich,</q> Mitya argued.
</p>

<p>
As for his <q>plan</q> it was just the same as before; it consisted of the
offer of his rights to Tchermashnya&mdash;but not with a commercial
object, as it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady
with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand&mdash;but
simply as a security for the debt. As he worked out this new
idea, Mitya was enchanted with it, but so it always was with him
in all his undertakings, in all his sudden decisions. He gave himself
up to every new idea with passionate enthusiasm. Yet, when he
mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov's house he felt a shiver of
fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as a mathematical
certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this broke down,
nothing else was left him in the world, but to <q>rob and murder
some one for the three thousand.</q> It was half-past seven when he
rang at the bell.
</p>

<p>
At first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was
announced he was received with extraordinary rapidity. <q>As though
she were waiting for me,</q> thought Mitya, and as soon as he had
been led to the drawing-room, the lady of the house herself ran in,
and declared at once that she was expecting him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I'd no
reason to suppose you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself.
Yet, I did expect you. You may marvel at my instinct,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was convinced all the morning that you
would come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is certainly wonderful, madam,</q> observed Mitya, sitting
down limply, <q>but I have come to you on a matter of great importance....
On a matter of supreme importance for me, that is,
madam ... for me alone ... and I hasten&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you've come on most important business, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch; it's not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking
back to the miraculous (have you heard about Father Zossima?).
<pb n='429'/><anchor id='Pg429'/>
This is a case of mathematics: you couldn't help coming, after all
that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna; you couldn't, you couldn't,
that's a mathematical certainty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The realism of actual life, madam, that's what it is. But allow
me to explain&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm all for realism now.
I've seen too much of miracles. You've heard that Father Zossima
is dead?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, madam, it's the first time I've heard of it.</q> Mitya was
a little surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Last night, and only imagine&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam,</q> said Mitya, <q>I can imagine nothing except that I'm
in a desperate position, and that if you don't help me, everything
will come to grief, and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality
of the expression, but I'm in a fever&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, I know that you're in a fever. You could hardly fail
to be, and whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have
long been thinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am
watching over it and studying it.... Oh, believe me, I'm an experienced
doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I'm certainly an experienced
patient,</q> said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, <q>and I
feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you will
come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to
you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and
what I am hoping of you.... I have come, madam&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't explain it. It's of secondary importance. But as for help,
you're not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have
most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband
was ruined, <q>had come to grief,</q> as you characteristically express it,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I recommended him to take to horse-breeding,
and now he's doing well. Have you any idea of horse-breeding,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!</q> cried
Mitya, in nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. <q>I
simply implore you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two
minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything,
the whole plan with which I have come. Besides, I am short of
<pb n='430'/><anchor id='Pg430'/>
time. I'm in a fearful hurry,</q> Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that
she was just going to begin talking again, and hoping to cut her
short. <q>I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of despair,
to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on
safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!
Only let me explain&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!</q> Madame
Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn, <q>and whatever
you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I've told you so
already. You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can
give you more, immeasurably more, I will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
but you must listen to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya started from his seat again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, will you really be so good!</q> he cried, with strong feeling.
<q>Good God, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a
violent death, from a bullet.... My eternal gratitude&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!</q> cried
Madame Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Infinitely? But I don't need so much. I only need that fatal
three thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum
with infinite gratitude, and I propose a plan which&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it's said and done.</q> Madame
Hohlakov cut him short, with the modest triumph of beneficence:
<q>I have promised to save you, and I will save you. I will save you
as I did Belmesov. What do you think of the gold-mines, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything
about them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over
and over again. I have been watching you for the last month. I've
watched you a hundred times as you've walked past, saying to myself:
That's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold-mines.
I've studied your gait and come to the conclusion: that's a man who
would find gold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From my gait, madam?</q> said Mitya, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can
be told from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the
idea. I'm all for science and realism now. After all this business
<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>
with Father Zossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I'm
a realist and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness. I'm
cured. <q>Enough!</q> as Turgenev says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to
lend me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> Madame Hohlakov cut in
at once. <q>The money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand,
but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time.
I'll make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold-mines, make
millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and
lead us to better things. Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You
will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help
the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch. You'll become famous and indispensable to the Department
of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The depreciation
of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;
people don't know that side of me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, madam!</q> Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment.
<q>I shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice,
madam.... I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold-mines....
I'll come and see you again about it ... many times, indeed ...
but now, that three thousand you so generously ... oh, that would
set me free, and if you could to-day ... you see, I haven't a minute,
a minute to lose to-day&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!</q> Madame Hohlakov interrupted
emphatically. <q>The question is, will you go to the gold-mines
or not; have you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or
no.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go, madam, afterwards.... I'll go where you like ...
but now&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running
to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling
out one drawer after another, looking for something with desperate
haste.
</p>

<p>
<q>The three thousand,</q> thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping,
<q>and at the instant ... without any papers or formalities ...
that's doing things in gentlemanly style! She's a splendid woman,
if only she didn't talk so much!</q>
</p>

<pb n='432'/><anchor id='Pg432'/>

<p>
<q>Here!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya,
<q>here is what I was looking for!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next
the skin with a cross.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> she went on reverently,
<q>from the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it
on your neck myself, and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new
career.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging
it. In extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped
her, and at last he got it under his neck-tie and collar through his
shirt to his chest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now you can set off,</q> Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting
down triumphantly in her place again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, I am so touched. I don't know how to thank you, indeed ...
for such kindness, but ... If only you knew how
precious time is to me.... That sum of money, for which I shall
be indebted to your generosity.... Oh, madam, since you are so
kind, so touchingly generous to me,</q> Mitya exclaimed impulsively,
<q>then let me reveal to you ... though, of course, you've known it
a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have been false
to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I've behaved
inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with
another woman ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise,
for you know everything already, but whom I cannot leave on any
account, and therefore that three thousand now&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> Madame Hohlakov interrupted
in the most decisive tone. <q>Leave everything, especially
women. Gold-mines are your goal, and there's no place for women
there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous, you will
find the girl of your heart in the highest society. That will be a
modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By that time
the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and the new
woman will have appeared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, that's not the point, not at all....</q> Mitya clasped
his hands in entreaty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very
thing you're yearning for, though you don't realize it yourself. I
<pb n='433'/><anchor id='Pg433'/>
am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch. The development of woman, and even the political
emancipation of woman in the near future&mdash;that's my ideal. I've
a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don't know that
side of me. I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that
subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the vocation
of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two
lines: <q>I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.
Persevere.</q> And I signed myself, <q>A Mother.</q> I thought of signing
myself <q>A contemporary Mother,</q> and hesitated, but I stuck to the
simple <q>Mother</q>; there's more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
And the word <q>contemporary</q> might have reminded him of
<q><hi rend='italic'>The Contemporary</hi></q>&mdash;a painful recollection owing to the
censorship.... Good Heavens, what is the matter!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam!</q> cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands
before her in helpless entreaty. <q>You will make me weep if you
delay what you have so generously&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That's a noble
feeling ... such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease
your heart, and later on you will return rejoicing. You will hasten
to me from Siberia on purpose to share your joy with me&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But allow me, too!</q> Mitya cried suddenly. <q>For the last time I
entreat you, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day,
if not, when may I come for it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven't got three thousand,</q>
Madame Hohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya
was stupefied.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as
good as in my hands&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that
case you misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. It's
true I promised you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I
remember it all now, but I was referring to the gold-mines.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the money? The three thousand?</q> Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.
</p>

<pb n='434'/><anchor id='Pg434'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, if you meant money, I haven't any. I haven't a penny,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm quarreling with my steward about it,
and I've just borrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself.
No, no, I've no money. And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
if I had, I wouldn't give it to you. In the first place I never lend
money. Lending money means losing friends. And I wouldn't give
it to you particularly. I wouldn't give it you, because I like you
and want to save you, for all you need is the gold-mines, the gold-mines,
the gold-mines!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, the devil!</q> roared Mitya, and with all his might brought
his fist down on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! Aie!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew
to the other end of the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out
of the house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one
possessed, and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he
had struck himself two days previously, before Alyosha, the last
time he saw him in the dark, on the road. What those blows upon
his breast signified, <emph>on that spot</emph>, and what he meant by it&mdash;that
was, for the time, a secret which was known to no one in the
world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that secret
meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he
had determined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that
would pay his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his
breast, from <emph>that spot on his breast</emph>, the shame he carried upon it,
that weighed on his conscience. All this will be fully explained
to the reader later on, but now that his last hope had vanished, this
man, so strong in appearance, burst out crying like a little child
a few steps from the Hohlakovs' house. He walked on, and not
knowing what he was doing, wiped away his tears with his fist.
In this way he reached the square, and suddenly became aware that
he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercing wail from
an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Lord, you've nearly killed me! Why don't you look where
you're going, scapegrace?</q>

<p>
<q>Why, it's you!</q> cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the
dark. It was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom
Mitya had particularly noticed the day before.
</p>

<pb n='435'/><anchor id='Pg435'/>

<p>
<q>And who are you, my good sir?</q> said the old woman, in quite a
different voice. <q>I don't know you in the dark.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. You're the servant there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch's.... But I
don't know you now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there
now?</q> said Mitya, beside himself with suspense. <q>I saw her to the
house some time ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What? Went away?</q> cried Mitya. <q>When did she go?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only
told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she
ran away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're lying, damn you!</q> roared Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! Aie!</q> shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.
</p>

<p>
He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived.
At the moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe.
It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure.
</p>

<p>
Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona,
in the kitchen when <q>the captain</q> ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing
shriek on seeing him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You scream?</q> roared Mitya, <q>where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a
word, he fell all of a heap at her feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fenya, for Christ's sake, tell me, where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don't know.
You may kill me but I can't tell you.</q> Fenya swore and protested.
<q>You went out with her yourself not long ago&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She came back!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Indeed she didn't. By God I swear she didn't come back.</q>
</p>
