<p>
Three days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday
morning my brother began going to church. <q>I am doing this
simply for your sake, mother, to please and comfort you,</q> he said.
My mother wept with joy and grief. <q>His end must be near,</q> she
thought, <q>if there's such a change in him.</q> But he was not able to
go to church long, he took to his bed, so he had to confess and take
the sacrament at home.
</p>

<p>
It was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of
<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>
fragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly,
but in the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair.
That's how I remember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his
face bright and joyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change
passed over him, his spirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would
come in and say, <q>Let me light the lamp before the holy image, my
dear.</q> And once he would not have allowed it and would have
blown it out.
</p>

<p>
<q>Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you
doing it. You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying
when I rejoice seeing you. So we are praying to the same God.</q>
</p>

<p>
Those words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her
room and weep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes
and looked cheerful. <q>Mother, don't weep, darling,</q> he would say,
<q>I've long to live yet, long to rejoice with you, and life is glad and
joyful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish
at night, coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't cry, mother,</q> he would answer, <q>life is paradise, and we
are all in paradise, but we won't see it, if we would, we should
have heaven on earth the next day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively;
we were all touched and wept. Friends came to see us.
<q>Dear ones,</q> he would say to them, <q>what have I done that you
should love me so, how can you love any one like me, and how was
it I did not know, I did not appreciate it before?</q>
</p>

<p>
When the servants came in to him he would say continually,
<q>Dear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve
to be waited on? If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait
on you, for all men should wait on one another.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mother shook her head as she listened. <q>My darling, it's your illness
makes you talk like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, darling,</q> he would say, <q>there must be servants and
masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as
they are to me. And another thing, mother, every one of us has
sinned against all men, and I more than any.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. <q>Why,
how could you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>
and murderers have done that, but what sin have you committed
yet, that you hold yourself more guilty than all?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, little heart of mine,</q> he said (he had begun using such
strange caressing words at that time), <q>little heart of mine, my
joy, believe me, every one is really responsible to all men for all men
and for everything. I don't know how to explain it to you, but I
feel it is so, painfully even. And how is it we went on then living,
getting angry and not knowing?</q>
</p>

<p>
So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous
and full of love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt,
came:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?</q> he would ask,
joking.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll live many days yet,</q> the doctor would answer, <q>and
months and years too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Months and years!</q> he would exclaim. <q>Why reckon the days?
One day is enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones,
why do we quarrel, try to outshine each other and keep grudges
against each other? Let's go straight into the garden, walk and
play there, love, appreciate, and kiss each other, and glorify life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your son cannot last long,</q> the doctor told my mother, as she
accompanied him to the door. <q>The disease is affecting his brain.</q>
</p>

<p>
The windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our
garden was a shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into
bud. The first birds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping
and singing at the windows. And looking at them and admiring
them, he began suddenly begging their forgiveness too: <q>Birds
of heaven, happy birds, forgive me, for I have sinned against you
too.</q> None of us could understand that at the time, but he shed
tears of joy. <q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>there was such a glory of God all
about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in shame and dishonored
it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You take too many sins on yourself,</q> mother used to say,
weeping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, darling, it's for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though
I can't explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for
I don't know how to love them enough. If I have sinned against
every one, yet all forgive me, too, and that's heaven. Am I not in
heaven now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>

<p>
And there was a great deal more I don't remember. I remember
I went once into his room when there was no one else there. It was
a bright evening, the sun was setting, and the whole room was
lighted up. He beckoned me, and I went up to him. He put his
hands on my shoulders and looked into my face tenderly, lovingly;
he said nothing for a minute, only looked at me like that.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> he said, <q>run and play now, enjoy life for me too.</q>
</p>

<p>
I went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life
afterwards I remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy
life for him too. There were many other marvelous and beautiful
sayings of his, though we did not understand them at the time.
He died the third week after Easter. He was fully conscious
though he could not talk; up to his last hour he did not change.
He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us,
beckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in the town about
his death. I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much
so, though I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then,
a child, but a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained
in my heart, ready to rise up and respond when the time
came. So indeed it happened.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her
to send me to Petersburg as other parents did. <q>You have only one
son now,</q> they said, <q>and have a fair income, and you will be
depriving him perhaps of a brilliant career if you keep him here.</q>
They suggested I should be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps,
that I might afterwards enter the Imperial Guard. My mother
hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her only child,
but she made up her mind to it at last, though not without many
tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought me
to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw
her again. For she too died three years afterwards. She spent those
three years mourning and grieving for both of us.
</p>

<p>
From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but
precious memories, for there are no memories more precious than
those of early childhood in one's first home. And that is almost
always so if there is any love and harmony in the family at all.
<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>
Indeed, precious memories may remain even of a bad home, if only
the heart knows how to find what is precious. With my memories
of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible, which, child as I
was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a book of Scripture
history then with excellent pictures, called <hi rend='italic'>A Hundred and Four
Stories from the Old and New Testament</hi>, and I learned to read
from it. I have it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious
relic of the past. But even before I learned to read, I remember
first being moved to devotional feeling at eight years old. My
mother took me alone to mass (I don't remember where my brother
was at the time) on the Monday before Easter. It was a fine day,
and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now, how the incense
rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and, overhead in
the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed
in at the little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for the first
time in my life I consciously received the seed of God's word in my
heart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a
big book, so large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry
it. He laid it on the reading desk, opened it, and began reading,
and suddenly for the first time I understood something read in the
church of God. In the land of Uz, there lived a man, righteous
and God-fearing, and he had great wealth, so many camels, so many
sheep and asses, and his children feasted, and he loved them very
much and prayed for them. <q>It may be that my sons have sinned
in their feasting.</q> Now the devil came before the Lord together
with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone up and
down the earth and under the earth. <q>And hast thou considered
my servant Job?</q> God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil,
pointing to his great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at
God's words. <q>Give him over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy
servant will murmur against Thee and curse Thy name.</q> And
God gave up the just man He loved so, to the devil. And the devil
smote his children and his cattle and scattered his wealth, all of a
sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his mantle
and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, <q>Naked came I
out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return into the earth;
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name
of the Lord for ever and ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood
rises up again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with
the breast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and
wonder and gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination,
and Satan, who talked like that with God, and God who gave
His servant up to destruction, and His servant crying out: <q>Blessed
be Thy name although Thou dost punish me,</q> and then the soft
and sweet singing in the church: <q>Let my prayer rise up before
Thee,</q> and again incense from the priest's censer and the kneeling
and the prayer. Ever since then&mdash;only yesterday I took it up&mdash;I've
never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how
much that is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it!
Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame, proud words,
<q>How could God give up the most loved of His saints for the diversion
of the devil, take from him his children, smite him with sore
boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a pot-sherd&mdash;and
for no object except to boast to the devil! <q>See what
My saint can suffer for My sake.</q></q> But the greatness of it lies just
in the fact that it is a mystery&mdash;that the passing earthly show
and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of
the earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator,
just as on the first days of creation He ended each day with praise:
<q>That is good that I have created,</q> looks upon Job and again praises
His creation. And Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but
all His creation for generations and generations, and for ever and
ever, since for that he was ordained. Good heavens, what a book
it is, and what lessons there are in it! What a book the Bible is,
what a miracle, what strength is given with it to man! It is like a
mold cast of the world and man and human nature, everything is
there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And what mysteries
are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him
wealth again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and
loves them. But how could he love those new ones when those
first children are no more, when he has lost them? Remembering
them, how could he be fully happy with those new ones, however
dear the new ones might be? But he could, he could. It's the great
<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/>
mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet,
tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous
blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before,
my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its
long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come
with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life&mdash;and
over all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving!
My life is ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I
feel how my earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown,
that approaching life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering
with rapture, my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.
</p>

<p>
Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late
one may hear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village
priests, are complaining on all sides of their miserable income
and their humiliating lot. They plainly state, even in print&mdash;I've
read it myself&mdash;that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the
people because of the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans
and heretics come and lead the flock astray, they let them lead
them astray because they have so little to live upon. May the
Lord increase the sustenance that is so precious to them, for their
complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say, if any one is to blame
in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he may be short of time,
he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while with work
and services, but still it's not all the time, even he has an hour a
week to remember God. And he does not work the whole year
round. Let him gather round him once a week, some hour in the
evening, if only the children at first&mdash;the fathers will hear of it and
they too will begin to come. There's no need to build halls for this,
let him take them into his own cottage. They won't spoil his cottage,
they would only be there one hour. Let him open that book
and begin reading it without grand words or superciliousness, without
condescension to them, but gently and kindly, being glad that
he is reading to them and that they are listening with attention,
loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to explain
words that are not understood by the peasants. Don't be anxious,
they will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand
all! Let him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac
and Rebecca, of how Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the
<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>
Lord in his dream and said, <q>This place is holy</q>&mdash;and he will impress
the devout mind of the peasant. Let him read, especially to the
children, how the brothers sold Joseph, the tender boy, the dreamer
and prophet, into bondage, and told their father that a wild beast
had devoured him, and showed him his blood-stained clothes. Let
him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt
for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by them,
tormented them, accused them, kept his brother Benjamin, and all
through love: <q>I love you, and loving you I torment you.</q> For
he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants
in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands, he
had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a
strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he
loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them
in love. He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his
heart, flung himself on his bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears
away, he went out to them joyful and told them, <q>Brothers, I am
your brother Joseph!</q> Let him read them further how happy old
Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive, and how
he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign
land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously
hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring,
from Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the
Messiah and Saviour.
</p>

<p>
Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don't be angry, that like a
little child I've been babbling of what you know long ago, and can
teach me a hundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture,
and forgive my tears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep,
the priest of God, and be sure that the hearts of his listeners will
throb in response. Only a little tiny seed is needed&mdash;drop it into
the heart of the peasant and it won't die, it will live in his soul
all his life, it will be hidden in the midst of his darkness and sin,
like a bright spot, like a great reminder. And there's no need of
much teaching or explanation, he will understand it all simply. Do
you suppose that the peasants don't understand? Try reading them
the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or
the miraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don't forget either the
parables of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>
(that is what I did), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the
conversion of St. Paul (that you mustn't leave out on any account),
and from the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>, for instance, the life of
Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of all, the happy martyr and the seer
of God, Mary of Egypt&mdash;and you will penetrate their hearts with
these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it in spite of your
poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for yourselves that
our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a hundred-fold.
Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words
they have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him
in his fields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect
than before&mdash;so that it will even increase his worldly well-being too.
The thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it
into words, for fear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is!
One who does not believe in God will not believe in God's people.
He who believes in God's people will see His Holiness too, even
though he had not believed in it till then. Only the people and
their future spiritual power will convert our atheists, who have torn
themselves away from their native soil.
</p>

<p>
And what is the use of Christ's words, unless we set an example?
The people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst
for the Word and for all that is good.
</p>

<p>
In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over
Russia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and
we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with
some fishermen. A good-looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined
us; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant's barge
along the bank. I noticed him looking straight before him with
clear and tender eyes. It was a bright, warm, still, July night, a
cool mist rose from the broad river, we could hear the plash of a
fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and beautiful, everything
praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, the lad and I,
and we talked of the beauty of this world of God's and of the great
mystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden
bee, all so marvelously know their path, though they have not intelligence,
they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually
accomplish it themselves. I saw the dear lad's heart was moved. He
told me that he loved the forest and the forest birds. He was a
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>
bird-catcher, knew the note of each of them, could call each bird.
<q>I know nothing better than to be in the forest,</q> said he, <q>though
all things are good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Truly,</q> I answered him, <q>all things are good and fair, because
all is truth. Look,</q> said I, <q>at the horse, that great beast that is so
near to man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works
for him; look at their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man,
who often beats them mercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence
and what beauty! It's touching to know that there's no sin
in them, for all, all except man, is sinless, and Christ has been
with them before us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why,</q> asked the boy, <q>is Christ with them too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It cannot but be so,</q> said I, <q>since the Word is for all. All
creation and all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing
glory to God, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing
this by the mystery of their sinless life. Yonder,</q> said I, <q>in the
forest wanders the dreadful bear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent
in it.</q> And I told him how once a bear came to a great
saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the wood. And the
great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear and gave him
a piece of bread. <q>Go along,</q> said he, <q>Christ be with you,</q> and
the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm.
And the lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without
hurting the saint, and that Christ was with him too. <q>Ah,</q> said
he, <q>how good that is, how good and beautiful is all God's work!</q>
He sat musing softly and sweetly. I saw he understood. And he
slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May God bless youth!
And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace and light
to Thy people!

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(c) Recollections of Father Zossima's Youth before he became
a Monk. The Duel</hi>
</p>

<p>
I spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet
school at Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings
there, many of my childish impressions grew dimmer, though I
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>
forgot nothing. I picked up so many new habits and opinions that
I was transformed into a cruel, absurd, almost savage creature.
A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I did acquire
together with the French language.
</p>

<p>
But we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our
service as cattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect,
for I was so much more impressionable than my companions. By
the time we left the school as officers, we were ready to lay down
our lives for the honor of the regiment, but no one of us had any
knowledge of the real meaning of honor, and if any one had
known it, he would have been the first to ridicule it. Drunkenness,
debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves
on. I don't say that we were bad by nature, all these young men
were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.
What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own
money, and so I flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged
headlong into all the recklessness of youth.
</p>

<p>
I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one
book I never opened at that time, though I always carried it about
with me, and I was never separated from it; in very truth I was
keeping that book <q>for the day and the hour, for the month and
the year,</q> though I knew it not.
</p>

<p>
After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K.
where our regiment was stationed at the time. We found the
people of the town hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I
met with a cordial reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament
and was known to be well off, which always goes a long
way in the world. And then a circumstance happened which was
the beginning of it all.
</p>

<p>
I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl
of noble and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected.
They were well-to-do people of influence and position. They always
gave me a cordial and friendly reception. I fancied that the young
lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an
idea. Later on I saw and fully realized that I perhaps was not so
passionately in love with her at all, but only recognized the elevation
of her mind and character, which I could not indeed have helped
doing. I was prevented, however, from making her an offer at the
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>
time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with the allurements of
my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my youth, and
with my pockets full of money. I did drop some hint as to my
feelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a
time. Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to
another district.
</p>

<p>
On my return two months later, I found the young lady already
married to a rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still
young though older than I was, connected with the best Petersburg
society, which I was not, and of excellent education, which I also
was not. I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance
that my mind was positively clouded. The worst of it all was that,
as I learned then, the young landowner had been a long while betrothed
to her, and I had met him indeed many times in her house,
but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And this particularly
mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while I
knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With
flushed face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of
declaring my love to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me
or to warn me, she must, I concluded, have been laughing at me
all the time. Later on, of course, I reflected and remembered that
she had been very far from laughing at me; on the contrary, she
used to turn off any love-making on my part with a jest and begin
talking of other subjects; but at that moment I was incapable of
reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. I am surprised to
remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely
repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found
it difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to work
myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.
</p>

<p>
I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my <q>rival</q>
in the presence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly
extraneous pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public
event&mdash;it was in the year 1826<note place='foot'>Probably the public event was
the Decabrist plot against the Tsar, of December
1825, in which the most distinguished men in Russia were
concerned.&mdash;<hi rend='smallcaps'>Translator's
Note.</hi></note>&mdash;and my jeer was, so people said,
clever and effective. Then I forced him to ask for an explanation,
and behaved so rudely that he accepted my challenge in spite of the
vast inequality between us, as I was younger, a person of no consequence,
<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/>
and of inferior rank. I learned afterwards for a fact that
it was from a jealous feeling on his side also that my challenge was
accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on his wife's account before
their marriage; he fancied now that if he submitted to be insulted
by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she heard
of it, she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him.
I soon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In
those days though duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a
kind of fashion among the officers&mdash;so strong and deeply rooted
will a brutal prejudice sometimes be.
</p>

<p>
It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at
seven o'clock the next day on the outskirts of the town&mdash;and then
something happened that in very truth was the turning-point of my
life. In the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor,
I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him two blows
in the face with all my might, so that it was covered with blood.
He had not long been in my service and I had struck him before,
but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it's
forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went to bed
and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was
breaking. I got up&mdash;I did not want to sleep any more&mdash;I went
to the window&mdash;opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw
the sun rising; it was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the meaning of it?</q> I thought. <q>I feel in my heart as
it were something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to
shed blood? No,</q> I thought, <q>I feel it's not that. Can it be that
I am afraid of death, afraid of being killed? No, that's not it,
that's not it at all.</q>... And all at once I knew what it was: it
was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose
before my mind, it all was as it were repeated over again; he stood
before me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was
holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me
as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even
dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has
been brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature!
What a crime! It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me
right through. I stood as if I were struck dumb, while the sun
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the
praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands, fell on my bed and
broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my brother
Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: <q>My dear
ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your
waiting on me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, am I worth it?</q> flashed through my mind. <q>After all what
am I worth, that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness
and image of God, should serve me?</q> For the first time in my
life this question forced itself upon me. He had said, <q>Mother, my
little heart, in truth we are each responsible to all for all, it's only
that men don't know this. If they knew it, the world would be a
paradise at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God, can that too be false?</q> I thought as I wept. <q>In truth,
perhaps, I am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner
than all men in the world.</q> And all at once the whole truth in
its full light appeared to me; what was I going to do? I was going
to kill a good, clever, noble man, who had done me no wrong, and
by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life, I should
be torturing and killing her too. I lay thus in my bed with my
face in the pillow, heedless how the time was passing. Suddenly my
second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah,</q> said he, <q>it's a good thing you are up already, it's time we
were off, come along!</q>
</p>

<p>
I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we
went out to the carriage, however.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait here a minute,</q> I said to him. <q>I'll be back directly, I have
forgotten my purse.</q>
</p>

<p>
And I ran back alone, to Afanasy's little room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Afanasy,</q> I said, <q>I gave you two blows on the face yesterday,
forgive me,</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
He started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I
saw that it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer's uniform,
I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me,</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
Then he was completely aghast.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>

<p>
And he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his
hands, turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I
flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ready,</q> I cried. <q>Have you ever seen a conqueror?</q> I asked
him. <q>Here is one before you.</q>
</p>

<p>
I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't remember
what about.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me. <q>Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll
keep up the honor of the uniform, I can see.</q>
</p>

<p>
So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We
were placed twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly,
looking him full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked
lovingly at him, for I knew what I would do. His shot just grazed
my cheek and ear.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God,</q> I cried, <q>no man has been killed,</q> and I seized my
pistol, turned back and flung it far away into the wood. <q>That's
the place for you,</q> I cried.
</p>

<p>
I turned to my adversary.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,</q> I said, <q>for my unprovoked
insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten
times worse than you and more, maybe. Tell that to the person
whom you hold dearest in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word,</q> cried my adversary, annoyed, <q>if you did not
want to fight, why did not you let me alone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,</q> I answered him
gayly.
</p>

<p>
<q>As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to
agree with your opinion,</q> said he.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo,</q> I cried, clapping my hands. <q>I agree with you there too.
I have deserved it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you shoot, sir, or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I won't,</q> I said; <q>if you like, fire at me again, but it would
be better for you not to fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: <q>Can you disgrace
the regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his
forgiveness! If I'd only known this!</q>
</p>

<p>
I stood facing them all, not laughing now.
</p>

<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> I said, <q>is it really so wonderful in these days to
find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his
wrongdoing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But not in a duel,</q> cried my second again.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what's so strange,</q> I said. <q>For I ought to have owned
my fault as soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before
leading him into a great and deadly sin; but we have made our life
so grotesque, that to act in that way would have been almost impossible,
for only after I have faced his shot at the distance of twelve
paces could my words have any significance for him, and if I had
spoken before, he would have said, <q>He is a coward, the sight of the
pistols has frightened him, no use to listen to him.</q> Gentlemen,</q> I
cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, <q>look around you
at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the
birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and
foolish, and we don't understand that life is heaven, for we have
only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its
beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.</q>
</p>

<p>
I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with
the sweetness and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss
in my heart as I had never known before in my life.
</p>

<p>
<q>All this as rational and edifying,</q> said my antagonist, <q>and in
any case you are an original person.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may laugh,</q> I said to him, laughing too, <q>but afterwards
you will approve of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,</q> said he; <q>will you shake
hands? for I believe you are genuinely sincere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> I said, <q>not now, later on when I have grown worthier and
deserve your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.</q>
</p>

<p>
We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I
kissed him. All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered
together to pass judgment on me the same day.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has disgraced the uniform,</q> they said; <q>let him resign his
commission.</q>
</p>

<p>
Some stood up for me: <q>He faced the shot,</q> they said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own
<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/>
pistol first before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into
the forest. No, there's something else in this, something original.</q>
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed listening and looking at them. <q>My dear friends and
comrades,</q> said I, <q>don't worry about my resigning my commission,
for I have done so already. I have sent in my papers this morning
and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery&mdash;it's
with that object I am leaving the regiment.</q>
</p>

<p>
When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
<q>You should have told us of that first, that explains everything,
we can't judge a monk.</q>
</p>

<p>
They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully,
but kindly and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even
those who had been sternest in their censure, and all the following
month, before my discharge came, they could not make enough of
me. <q>Ah, you monk,</q> they would say. And every one said something
kind to me, they began trying to dissuade me, even to pity
me: <q>What are you doing to yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> they would say, <q>he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and
could have fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before
that he should become a monk, that's why he did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I
had been kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention,
and now all came to know me at once and invited me; they
laughed at me, but they loved me. I may mention that although
everybody talked openly of our duel, the authorities took no notice
of it, because my antagonist was a near relation of our general, and
as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences, and as
I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And I began then
to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter, for it was
always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversations mostly
took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women particularly
liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can I possibly be responsible for all?</q> every one would
laugh in my face. <q>Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You may well not know it,</q> I would answer, <q>since the whole
world has long been going on a different line, since we consider
the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others. Here
I have for once in my life acted sincerely and, well, you all look
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>
upon me as a madman. Though you are friendly to me, yet, you
see, you all laugh at me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can we help being friendly to you?</q> said my hostess,
laughing. The room was full of people. All of a sudden the young
lady rose, on whose account the duel had been fought and whom
only lately I had intended to be my future wife. I had not noticed
her coming into the room. She got up, came to me and held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me tell you,</q> she said, <q>that I am the first not to laugh at
you, but on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my
respect for you for your action then.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and
almost kissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention
was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me
with the others. I knew him by name already, but had never made
his acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>(d) The Mysterious Visitor</hi>
</p>

<p>
He had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent
position, respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence.
He subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan
asylum; he was very charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only
became known after his death. He was a man of about fifty, almost
stern in appearance and not much given to conversation. He had
been married about ten years and his wife, who was still young, had
borne him three children. Well, I was sitting alone in my room
the following evening, when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman
walked in.
</p>

<p>
I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my
former quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms
with an old lady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady's
servant waited upon me, for I had moved into her rooms simply
because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the
regiment, as I felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last
interview with him. So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed
of any righteous action.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> said my visitor, <q>with great interest listened to you
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
speaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last
to make your personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately.
Can you, dear sir, grant me this favor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an
honor.</q> I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I
impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man.
For though other people had listened to me with interest and attention,
no one had come to me before with such a serious, stern and
concentrated expression. And now he had come to see me in my
own rooms. He sat down.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,</q> he said;
<q>as you have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you
risked incurring the contempt of all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,</q> I replied.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not excessive,</q> he answered; <q>believe me, such a course
of action is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has
impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to
you,</q> he continued. <q>Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed
by my perhaps unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations,
if you can recall them, at the moment when you made up
your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel. Do not think my question
frivolous; on the contrary, I have in asking the question a secret
motive of my own, which I will perhaps explain to you later on, if
it is God's will that we should become more intimately acquainted.</q>
</p>

<p>
All the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into
the face and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great
curiosity on my side also, for I felt that there was some strange
secret in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I
asked my opponent's forgiveness,</q> I answered; <q>but I had better tell
you from the beginning what I have not yet told any one else.</q>
And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me, and
how I had bowed down to the ground at his feet. <q>From that you
can see for yourself,</q> I concluded, <q>that at the time of the duel it
was easier for me, for I had made a beginning already at home, and
when once I had started on that road, to go farther along it was far
from being difficult, but became a source of joy and happiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
I liked the way he looked at me as he listened. <q>All that,</q> he
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
said, <q>is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening.
And we should have become greater friends, if only he had
ever talked of himself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a
word, yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of that I
became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him
about all my feelings; <q>for,</q> thought I, <q>what need have I to know
his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a good man?
Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he comes
to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.</q> And I
learned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man
of lofty mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>That life is heaven,</q> he said to me suddenly, <q>that I have long
been thinking about</q>; and all at once he added, <q>I think of nothing
else indeed.</q> He looked at me and smiled. <q>I am more convinced
of it than you are, I will tell you later why.</q>
</p>

<p>
I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell
me something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven,</q> he went on, <q>lies hidden within all of us&mdash;here it lies
hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow
and for all time.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing
mysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own
sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how
you could comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in
very truth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven
will be for them not a dream, but a living reality.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when,</q> I cried out to him bitterly, <q>when will that come
to pass? and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream
of ours?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What then, you don't believe it,</q> he said. <q>You preach it and
don't believe it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will
come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every
process has its law. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform
the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another
path psychologically. Until you have become really, in actual fact,
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
a brother to every one, brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort
of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach
men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for
all. Every one will think his share too small and they will be always
envying, complaining and attacking one another. You ask when it
will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go
through the period of isolation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by isolation?</q> I asked him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age&mdash;it
has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For
every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes
to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime
all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction,
for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at
complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into
units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds
aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends
by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches
by himself and thinks, <q>How strong I am now and how secure,</q> and
in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up,
the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed
to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the
whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others,
in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose
his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere
in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand
that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather
than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism
must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how
unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the
spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long
in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the Son
of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must
keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and
his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so
draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act
of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.</q>
</p>

<p>
Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
fervent talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less
frequently. Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not
as blame, for they still loved me and treated me good-humoredly,
but there's no denying that fashion is a great power in society. I
began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration, for besides
enjoying his intelligence, I began to perceive that he was brooding
over some plan in his heart, and was preparing himself perhaps for
a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his
secret, not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by insinuation.
But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show signs of wanting
to tell me something. This had become quite evident, indeed, about
a month after he first began to visit me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know,</q> he said to me once, <q>that people are very inquisitive
about us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so
often. But let them wonder, for <emph>soon all will be explained</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and
almost always on such occasions he would get up and go away.
Sometimes he would fix a long piercing look upon me, and I
thought, <q>He will say something directly now.</q> But he would
suddenly begin talking of something ordinary and familiar. He
often complained of headache too.
</p>

<p>
One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking
with great fervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his
face worked convulsively, while he stared persistently at me.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter?</q> I said; <q>do you feel ill?</q>&mdash;he had just
been complaining of headache.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.</q>
</p>

<p>
He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. <q>Why
is it he is smiling?</q> The thought flashed through my mind before I
realized anything else. I too turned pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you saying?</q> I cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see,</q> he said, with a pale smile, <q>how much it has cost me
to say the first word. Now I have said it, I feel I've taken the first
step and shall go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
For a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him
at that time, but only after he had been to see me three days running
and told me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended
<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>
by being convinced, to my great grief and amazement. His crime
was a great and terrible one.
</p>

<p>
Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner,
a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in
our town. He fell passionately in love with her, declared his feeling
and tried to persuade her to marry him. But she had already
given her heart to another man, an officer of noble birth and high
rank in the service, who was at that time away at the front, though
she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer
and begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to
visit her, he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter
at night through the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery.
But, as often happens, a crime committed with extraordinary
audacity is more successful than others.
</p>

<p>
Entering the garret through the skylight, he went down the
ladder, knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes,
through the negligence of the servants, left unlocked. He hoped
to find it so, and so it was. He made his way in the dark to her
bedroom, where a light was burning. As though on purpose, both
her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the same street, without
asking leave. The other servants slept in the servants' quarters
or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passion flamed up at the
sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger took possession
of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he
thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then
with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion
should fall on the servants. He was so base as to take her purse,
to open her chest with keys from under her pillow, and to take
some things from it, doing it all as it might have been done by an
ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers and taking only money.
He took some of the larger gold things, but left smaller articles
that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too, some
things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done
this awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.
</p>

<p>
Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any
time after in his life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was
the criminal. No one indeed knew of his love for her, for he was
always reserved and silent and had no friend to whom he would
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>
have opened his heart. He was looked upon simply as an acquaintance,
and not a very intimate one, of the murdered woman, as for
the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf of hers
called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance confirmed
the suspicion. The man knew&mdash;indeed his mistress did not
conceal the fact&mdash;that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit
she had decided to send him, as he had no relations and his conduct
was unsatisfactory. People had heard him angrily threatening to
murder her when he was drunk in a tavern. Two days before her
death, he had run away, staying no one knew where in the town.
The day after the murder, he was found on the road leading out of
the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his right hand
happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose had
been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that
they had gone to a party and that the street-door had been left
open till they returned. And a number of similar details came to
light, throwing suspicion on the innocent servant.
</p>

<p>
They arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week
after the arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious
in the hospital. There the matter ended and the judges and
the authorities and every one in the town remained convinced that
the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had
died in the hospital. And after that the punishment began.
</p>

<p>
My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he
was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable
a long time, but not for that reason; only from regret that
he had killed the woman he loved, that she was no more, that in
killing her he had killed his love, while the fire of passion was still
in his veins. But of the innocent blood he had shed, of the murder
of a fellow creature, he scarcely thought. The thought that his
victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable
to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in his conscience
that he could not have acted otherwise.
</p>

<p>
At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness
and death soon set his mind at rest, for the man's death was apparently
(so he reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his
fright, but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away, when he
had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground. The theft of
<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>
the money and other things troubled him little, for he argued that
the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion.
The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards subscribed the
whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for maintaining an
almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his conscience
at rest about the theft, and it's a remarkable fact that for a long
time he really was at peace&mdash;he told me this himself. He entered
then upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for
a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and
being a man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he
recalled it, he tried not to think of it at all. He became active in
philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many institutions
in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow
and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies.
</p>

<p>
At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain
of it was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and
intelligent girl and soon after married her, hoping that marriage
would dispel his lonely depression, and that by entering on a new
life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and children, he
would escape from old memories altogether. But the very opposite
of what he expected happened. He began, even in the first month
of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the thought, <q>My wife
loves me&mdash;but what if she knew?</q> When she first told him that
she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. <q>I am giving life,
but I have taken life.</q> Children came. <q>How dare I love them,
teach and educate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have
shed blood.</q> They were splendid children, he longed to caress them;
<q>and I can't look at their innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the
blood of his murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed,
by the blood that cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have
awful dreams. But, being a man of fortitude, he bore his suffering
a long time, thinking: <q>I shall expiate everything by this secret
agony.</q> But that hope, too, was vain; the longer it went on, the
more intense was his suffering.
</p>

<p>
He was respected in society for his active benevolence, though
every one was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But
the more he was respected, the more intolerable it was for him. He
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>
confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself. But he
began to be haunted by another idea&mdash;an idea which he had at first
