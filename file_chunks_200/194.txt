<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirée</foreign> at the house
of a lady of high rank in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in
the Ministry. Well, an evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was
God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth....
Of course, it took only an instant, but you know a ray of light
from the sun takes full eight minutes, and fancy in an evening suit
and open waistcoat. Spirits don't freeze, but when one's in fleshly
form, well ... in brief, I didn't think, and set off, and you know
in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is above the firmament,
there's such a frost ... at least one can't call it frost, you can
fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game the village
girls play&mdash;they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees
of frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin
off, so it bleeds. But that's only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I
imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it
would be the end of it ... if only there could be an ax there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And can there be an ax there?</q> Ivan interrupted, carelessly and
disdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe
in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.
</p>

<p>
<q>An ax?</q> the guest interrupted in surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what would become of an ax there?</q> Ivan cried suddenly,
with a sort of savage and insistent obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
<q>What would become of an ax in space?
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Quelle idée!</foreign> If it were
to fall to any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the
earth without knowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would
calculate the rising and the setting of the ax, <hi rend='italic'>Gatzuk</hi> would put
it in his calendar, that's all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are stupid, awfully stupid,</q> said Ivan peevishly. <q>Fib more
cleverly or I won't listen. You want to get the better of me by
realism, to convince me that you exist, but I don't want to believe
you exist! I won't believe it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not fibbing, it's all the truth; the truth is unhappily
<pb n='725'/><anchor id='Pg725'/>
hardly ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big
of me, and perhaps something fine. That's a great pity, for I only
give what I can&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't talk philosophy, you ass!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am
moaning and groaning. I've tried all the medical faculty: they can
diagnose beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their
finger-tips, but they've no idea how to cure you. There was an
enthusiastic little student here, <q>You may die,</q> said he, <q>but you'll
know perfectly what disease you are dying of!</q> And then what a
way they have sending people to specialists! <q>We only diagnose,</q>
they say, <q>but go to such-and-such a specialist, he'll cure you.</q>
The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of disease has completely
disappeared, I assure you, now there are only specialists and they all
advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrong with your nose,
they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European specialist who
cures noses. If you go to Paris, he'll look at your nose; I can only
cure your right nostril, he'll tell you, for I don't cure the left
nostril, that's not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there's a
specialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I
fell back on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub
myself with honey and salt in the bath-house. Solely to get an
extra bath I went, smeared myself all over and it did me no good
at all. In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a
book and some drops, bless him, and, only fancy, Hoff's malt extract
cured me! I bought it by accident, drank a bottle and a half of it,
and I was ready to dance, it took it away completely. I made up
my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I was prompted
by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a
bother: not a single paper would take my letter. <q>It would be very
reactionary,</q> they said, <q>no one will believe it.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Le diable n'existe point.</foreign>
You'd better remain anonymous,</q> they advised me. What
use is a letter of thanks if it's anonymous? I laughed with the men
at the newspaper office; <q>It's reactionary to believe in God in our
days,</q> I said, <q>but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.</q> <q>We quite
understand that,</q> they said. <q>Who doesn't believe in the devil?
Yet it won't do, it might injure our reputation. As a joke, if you
like.</q> But I thought as a joke it wouldn't be very witty. So it
<pb n='726'/><anchor id='Pg726'/>
wasn't printed. And do you know, I have felt sore about it to this
day. My best feelings, gratitude, for instance, are literally denied
me simply from my social position.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Philosophical reflections again?</q> Ivan snarled malignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>God preserve me from it, but one can't help complaining sometimes.
I am a slandered man. You upbraid me every moment with
being stupid. One can see you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence
isn't the only thing! I have naturally a kind and merry heart.
<q>I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.</q> You seem to take me for
Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more serious one. Before
time was, by some decree which I could never make out, I was pre-destined
<q>to deny</q> and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not at
all inclined to negation. <q>No, you must go and deny, without denial
there's no criticism and what would a journal be without a column
of criticism?</q> Without criticism it would be nothing but one <q>hosannah.</q>
But nothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah
must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on, in the
same style. But I don't meddle in that, I didn't create it, I am not
answerable for it. Well, they've chosen their scapegoat, they've
made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible.
We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask for
annihilation. No, live, I am told, for there'd be nothing without
you. If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would
happen. There would be no events without you, and there must
be events. So against the grain I serve to produce events and do
what's irrational because I am commanded to. For all their indisputable
intelligence, men take this farce as something serious, and
that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course ... but then they
live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for suffering is life.
Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? It would be
transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but
tedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don't live.
I am x in an indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in
life who has lost all beginning and end, and who has even forgotten
his own name. You are laughing&mdash; no, you are not laughing, you
are angry again. You are for ever angry, all you care about is intelligence,
but I repeat again that I would give away all this super-stellar
life, all the ranks and honors, simply to be transformed into
<pb n='727'/><anchor id='Pg727'/>
the soul of a merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles
at God's shrine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then even you don't believe in God?</q> said Ivan, with a smile of
hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>What can I say?&mdash;that is, if you are in earnest&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there a God or not?</q> Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I
don't know. There! I've said it now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know, but you see God? No, you are not some one
apart, you are myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish,
you are my fancy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would
be true. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Je pense, donc je suis</foreign>,
I know that for a fact; all the rest,
all these worlds, God and even Satan&mdash;all that is not proved, to my
mind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of
myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed
for ever: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping
up to beat me directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better tell me some anecdote!</q> said Ivan miserably.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend,
not an anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say,
yet you don't believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one
like that. We are all in a muddle over there now and all through
your science. Once there used to be atoms, five senses, four elements,
and then everything hung together somehow. There were
atoms in the ancient world even, but since we've learned that you've
discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil
knows what, we had to lower our crest. There's a regular muddle,
and, above all, superstition, scandal; there's as much scandal among
us as among you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed,
for we have our secret police department where private information
is received. Well, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages&mdash;not
yours, but ours&mdash;and no one believes it even among us, except
the old ladies of eighteen stone, not your old ladies I mean, but ours.
We've everything you have, I am revealing one of our secrets out
of friendship for you; though it's forbidden. This legend is about
Paradise. There was, they say, here on earth a thinker and philosopher.
He rejected everything, <q>laws, conscience, faith,</q> and,
<pb n='728'/><anchor id='Pg728'/>
above all, the future life. He died; he expected to go straight to
darkness and death and he found a future life before him. He was
astounded and indignant. <q>This is against my principles!</q> he said.
And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me,
I am just repeating what I heard myself, it's only a legend ...
he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (we've
adopted the metric system, you know) and when he has finished
that quadrillion, the gates of heaven would be opened to him and
he'll be forgiven&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what tortures have you in the other world besides the
quadrillion kilometers?</q> asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.
</p>

<p>
<q>What tortures? Ah, don't ask. In old days we had all sorts,
but now they have taken chiefly to moral punishments&mdash;<q>the stings
of conscience</q> and all that nonsense. We got that, too, from you,
from the softening of your manners. And who's the better for it?
Only those who have got no conscience, for how can they be tortured
by conscience when they have none? But decent people who
have conscience and a sense of honor suffer for it. Reforms, when
the ground has not been prepared for them, especially if they are
institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but mischief! The
ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemned to
the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down
across the road. <q>I won't go, I refuse on principle!</q> Take the soul
of an enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the
prophet Jonah, who sulked for three days and nights in the belly
of the whale, and you get the character of that thinker who lay
across the road.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he lie on there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not
laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo!</q> cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now
he was listening with an unexpected curiosity. <q>Well, is he lying
there now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's the point, that he isn't. He lay there almost a thousand
years and then he got up and went on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What an ass!</q> cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming
to be pondering something intently. <q>Does it make any difference
<pb n='729'/><anchor id='Pg729'/>
whether he lies there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers?
It would take a billion years to walk it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Much more than that. I haven't got a pencil and paper or I
could work it out. But he got there long ago, and that's where
the story begins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to
do it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present
earth may have been repeated a billion times. Why, it's become
extinct, been frozen; cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into
its elements, again <q>the water above the firmament,</q> then again a
comet, again a sun, again from the sun it becomes earth&mdash;and the
same sequence may have been repeated endlessly and exactly the
same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably tedious&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well, what happened when he arrived?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked
in, before he had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to
my thinking his watch must have long dissolved into its elements on
the way), he cried out that those two seconds were worth walking
not a quadrillion kilometers but a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised
to the quadrillionth power! In fact, he sang <q>hosannah</q> and overdid
it so, that some persons there of lofty ideas wouldn't shake hands
with him at first&mdash;he'd become too rapidly reactionary, they said.
The Russian temperament. I repeat, it's a legend. I give it for
what it's worth. So that's the sort of ideas we have on such subjects
even now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've caught you!</q> Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight,
as though he had succeeded in remembering something at last.
<q>That anecdote about the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I
was seventeen then, I was at the high school. I made up that
anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin, it was at
Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic that I couldn't have
taken it from anywhere. I thought I'd forgotten it ... but I've
unconsciously recalled it&mdash;I recalled it myself&mdash;it was not you
telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like
that even when people are being taken to execution ... it's come
back to me in a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream,
not a living creature!</q>
</p>

<pb n='730'/><anchor id='Pg730'/>

<p>
<q>From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,</q>
laughed the gentleman, <q>I am convinced that you believe in me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not in the slightest! I haven't a hundredth part of a grain of
faith in you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses
perhaps are the strongest. Confess that you have faith even to the
ten-thousandth of a grain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not for one minute,</q> cried Ivan furiously. <q>But I should like to
believe in you,</q> he added strangely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aha! There's an admission! But I am good-natured. I'll come
to your assistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me.
I told you your anecdote you'd forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy
your faith in me completely.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of
your existence!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and
disbelief&mdash;is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as
you are, that it's better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you
are inclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling
you that anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and
I have my motive in it. It's the new method. As soon as you disbelieve
in me completely, you'll begin assuring me to my face that
I am not a dream but a reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained
my object, which is an honorable one. I shall sow in you
only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree&mdash;and
such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will long to enter the ranks
of <q>the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women,</q> for that
is what you are secretly longing for. You'll dine on locusts, you'll
wander into the wilderness to save your soul!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then it's for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it,
you scoundrel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you
are!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and
prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown
with moss?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I've done nothing else. One forgets the whole
world and all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he
<pb n='731'/><anchor id='Pg731'/>
is a very precious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes
worth a whole constellation. We have our system of reckoning, you
know. The conquest is priceless! And some of them, on my word,
are not inferior to you in culture, though you won't believe it.
They can contemplate such depths of belief and disbelief at the same
moment that sometimes it really seems that they are within a hair's-breadth
of being <q>turned upside down,</q> as the actor Gorbunov says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, did you get your nose pulled?</q><note place='foot'>Literally: <q>Did you
get off with a long nose made at you?</q>&mdash;a proverbial
expression in Russia for failure.</note>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow,</q> observed the visitor sententiously, <q>it's better
to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an
afflicted marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated
by a specialist) in confession to his spiritual father&mdash;a Jesuit. I was
present, it was simply charming. <q>Give me back my nose!</q> he said,
and he beat his breast. <q>My son,</q> said the priest evasively, <q>all things
are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of
Providence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary,
though unapparent, benefits. If stern destiny has deprived
you of your nose, it's to your advantage that no one can ever pull
you by your nose.</q> <q>Holy father, that's no comfort,</q> cried the
despairing marquis. <q>I'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every
day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.</q> <q>My son,</q> sighs
the priest, <q>you can't expect every blessing at once. This is murmuring
against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you,
for if you repine as you repined just now, declaring you'd be glad
to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has
already been fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you
were led by the nose.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool, how stupid!</q> cried Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that's
the genuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word
for word as I've told you. It happened lately and gave me a great
deal of trouble. The unhappy young man shot himself that very
night when he got home. I was by his side till the very last moment.
Those Jesuit confessionals are really my most delightful
diversion at melancholy moments. Here's another incident that happened
only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of twenty&mdash;a
<pb n='732'/><anchor id='Pg732'/>
buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth
water&mdash;comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her
sin into the grating. <q>Why, my daughter, have you fallen again
already?</q> cries the priest. <q>O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not
the same man this time, how long is this going on? Aren't you
ashamed!</q> <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ah, mon père</foreign>,</q>
answers the sinner with tears of penitence, <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ça
lui fait tant de plaisir, et à moi si peu de peine!</foreign></q> Fancy,
such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of nature, better
than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on the spot and
was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the priest
at the grating making an appointment with her for the evening&mdash;though
he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! It was
nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turning
up your nose again? Angry again? I don't know how to
please you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting
nightmare,</q> Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition.
<q>I am bored with you, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give
anything to be able to shake you off!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand of me
<q>everything great and noble</q> and you'll see how well we shall get
on,</q> said the gentleman impressively. <q>You are really angry with
me for not having appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and
lightning, with scorched wings, but have shown myself in such a
modest form. You are wounded, in the first place, in your esthetic
feelings, and, secondly, in your pride. How could such a vulgar
devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is that romantic
strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can't help it,
young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of
appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the
Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I
was positively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me for
daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least,
the Polar Star or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid,
but, mercy on us! I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence.
Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil, but did only
good. Well, he can say what he likes, it's quite the opposite with
me. I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth
<pb n='733'/><anchor id='Pg733'/>
and genuinely desires good. I was there when the Word, Who died
on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul
of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim
singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the
seraphim which shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you
by all that's sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah
with them all. The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken
from my lips ... you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable
I am. But common sense&mdash;oh, a most unhappy trait in
my character&mdash;kept me in due bounds and I let the moment pass!
For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have happened
after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been
extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so,
solely from a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced
to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody
takes all the credit of what's good for Himself, and nothing
but nastiness is left for me. But I don't envy the honor of a life
of idle imposture, I am not ambitious. Why am I, of all creatures
in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be
kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such consequences
sometimes? I know, of course, there's a secret in it, but
they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps, seeing
the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable
minus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme
throughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the
end of everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who
would take them in? I know that at the end of all things I shall
be reconciled. I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret.
But till that happens I am sulking and fulfill my destiny though it's
against the grain&mdash;that is, to ruin thousands for the sake of saving
one. How many souls have had to be ruined and how many honorable
reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man,
Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days! Yes, till
the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for me&mdash;one, their
truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the other
my own. And there's no knowing which will turn out the better....
Are you asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I might well be,</q> Ivan groaned angrily. <q>All my stupid ideas&mdash;outgrown,
<pb n='734'/><anchor id='Pg734'/>
thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead
carcass&mdash;you present to me as something new!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you
by my literary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn't bad,
was it? And then that ironical tone <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à la</foreign>
Heine, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget
a flunkey like you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young
Russian gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature
and art, the author of a promising poem entitled
<hi rend='italic'>The Grand Inquisitor</hi>.
I was only thinking of him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I forbid you to speak of <hi rend='italic'>The Grand Inquisitor</hi>,</q>
cried Ivan, crimson with shame.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the <hi rend='italic'>Geological Cataclysm</hi>. Do you remember? That was
a poem, now!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, or I'll kill you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat
myself to that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young
friends, quivering with eagerness for life! <q>There are new men,</q>
you decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, <q>they
propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid
fellows! they didn't ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need
be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man,
that's how we have to set to work. It's that, that we must begin
with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon
as men have all of them denied God&mdash;and I believe that period,
analogous with geological periods, will come to pass&mdash;the old conception
of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and,
what's more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew.
Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy
and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up with a
spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From
hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will
and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in
doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of
heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept
death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that
it's useless for him to repine at life's being a moment, and he will
<pb n='735'/><anchor id='Pg735'/>
love his brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient
only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness
will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams
of eternal love beyond the grave</q>... and so on and so on in the
same style. Charming!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his
ears, but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible
that such a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined
and humanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man's
inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand
years, every one who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately
order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, <q>all
things are lawful</q> for him. What's more, even if this period never
comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality,
the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is the only
one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position, he may
lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old
slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God
stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost
place ... <q>all things are lawful</q> and that's the end of it!
That's all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you
want a moral sanction for doing it? But that's our modern Russian
all over. He can't bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction.
He is so in love with truth&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence,
speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But
he did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from
the table and flung it at the orator.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ah, mais c'est bête enfin</foreign>,</q>
cried the latter, jumping up from the
sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. <q>He remembers
Luther's inkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at
a dream! It's like a woman! I suspected you were only pretending
to stop up your ears.</q>
</p>

<p>
A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window.
Ivan jumped up from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you hear? You'd better open,</q> cried the visitor; <q>it's your
<pb n='736'/><anchor id='Pg736'/>
brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I'll
be bound!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming,
and of course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings
<q>news,</q></q> Ivan exclaimed frantically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Open, open to him. There's a snowstorm and he is your brother.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait?
C'est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window,
but something seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained
every effort to break his chains, but in vain. The knocking at the
window grew louder and louder. At last the chains were broken
and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked round him wildly.
Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just thrown at
his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one on
the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on
persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his
dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened
just now!</q> cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened
the movable pane.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I told you not to come,</q> he cried fiercely to his brother.
<q>In two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,</q> Alyosha answered
from the yard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come round to the steps, I'll open at once,</q> said Ivan, going to
open the door to Alyosha.
</p>

<head>Chapter X. <q>It Was He Who Said That</q></head>

<p>
Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago
Marya Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him
Smerdyakov had taken his own life. <q>I went in to clear away the
samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall.</q> On Alyosha's
inquiring whether she had informed the police, she answered that
<pb n='737'/><anchor id='Pg737'/>
she had told no one, <q>but I flew straight to you, I've run all the
way.</q> She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking
like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he found
Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: <q>I destroy my
life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.</q>
Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police
captain and told him all about it. <q>And from him I've come straight
to you,</q> said Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's
face. He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story, as
though struck by something in his expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> he cried suddenly, <q>you must be terribly ill. You
look and don't seem to understand what I tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a good thing you came,</q> said Ivan, as though brooding, and
not hearing Alyosha's exclamation. <q>I knew he had hanged himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me.
He told me so just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same
brooding tone, looking at the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is <emph>he</emph>?</q> asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's slipped away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a <q>pure
cherub.</q> Dmitri calls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous
rapture of the seraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole
constellation. But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical
molecule. There's a constellation of the Lion and the Sun. Don't
you know it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, sit down,</q> said Alyosha in alarm. <q>For goodness' sake,
sit down on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow,
that's right. Would you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps
it will do you good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down
there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not here. Don't worry yourself. I know where it is&mdash;here,</q>
said Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused,
by Ivan's dressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan
<pb n='738'/><anchor id='Pg738'/>
looked strangely at the towel: recollection seemed to come back to
him for an instant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay</q>&mdash;he got up from the sofa&mdash;<q>an hour ago I took that new
towel from there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and
threw it down here ... How is it it's dry? There was no other.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You put that towel on your head?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ...
Why have the candles burnt down so? What's the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nearly twelve.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, no!</q> Ivan cried suddenly. <q>It was not a dream. He
was here; he was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked
at the window, I threw a glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute.
I was asleep last time, but this dream was not a dream. It has
happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha ... yet they are
not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ... though I
am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is
frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.</q> Ivan laughed suddenly
and began pacing about the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?</q> Alyosha
asked anxiously again.
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil! He's taken to visiting me. He's been here twice,
almost three times. He taunted me with being angry at his being
a simple devil and not Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and
lightning. But he is not Satan: that's a lie. He is an impostor.
He is simply a devil&mdash;a paltry, trivial devil. He goes to the baths.
If you undressed him, you'd be sure to find he had a tail, long and
smooth like a Danish dog's, a yard long, dun color.... Alyosha,
you are cold. You've been in the snow. Would you like some tea?
What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some?
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est à ne pas
mettre un chien dehors.</foreign>...</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded
Ivan to sit down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He
sat down beside him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What were you telling me just now about Lise?</q> Ivan began
again. (He was becoming very talkative.) <q>I like Lise. I said
something nasty about her. It was a lie. I like her ... I am
afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more afraid of her than of anything.
On account of the future. She will cast me off to-morrow
<pb n='739'/><anchor id='Pg739'/>
and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining Mitya
from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it's not
so. To-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan't hang
myself. Do you know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it
because I am base? I am not a coward. Is it from love of life?
How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself? Yes, it was
<emph>he</emph> told me so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?</q>
asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him
away. You did drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived.
I love your face, Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face?
And <emph>he</emph> is myself, Alyosha. All that's base in me, all that's mean and
contemptible. Yes, I am a romantic. He guessed it ... though
it's a libel. He is frightfully stupid; but it's to his advantage. He
has cunning, animal cunning&mdash;he knew how to infuriate me. He
kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was how he made
me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great
deal that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned
it to myself. Do you know, Alyosha,</q> Ivan added in an intensely
earnest and confidential tone, <q>I should be awfully glad to think
that it was <emph>he</emph> and not I.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has worn you out,</q> said Alyosha, looking compassionately at
his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so
cleverly. <q>Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for
myself. Why am I tormented by it? From habit. From the
universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years. So let
us give it up, and we shall be gods.</q> It was he said that, it was he
said that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And not you, not you?</q> Alyosha could not help crying, looking
frankly at his brother. <q>Never mind him, anyway; have done
with him and forget him. And let him take with him all that you
curse now, and never come back!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent,
Alyosha,</q> Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. <q>But he was unfair
to me, unfair to me about lots of things. He told lies about me to
my face. <q>Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue:
<pb n='740'/><anchor id='Pg740'/>
to confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him
at your instigation.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> Alyosha interposed, <q>restrain yourself. It was not
you murdered him. It's not true!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what he says, he, and he knows it. <q>You are going to
perform an act of heroic virtue, and you don't believe in virtue;
that's what tortures you and makes you angry, that's why you are
so vindictive.</q> He said that to me about me and he knows what
he says.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's you say that, not he,</q> exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, <q>and
you say it because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, he knows what he says. <q>You are going from pride,</q> he
says. <q>You'll stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you
writhe with horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise
your horror!</q> He said that about me. <q>And do you know you are
longing for their praise&mdash;<q>he is a criminal, a murderer, but what a
generous soul; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed.</q></q>
That's a lie, Alyosha!</q> Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes. <q>I
don't want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I don't! That's a
lie! That's why I threw the glass at him and it broke against his
ugly face.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, calm yourself, stop!</q> Alyosha entreated him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he knows how to torment one. He's cruel,</q> Ivan went on,
unheeding. <q>I had an inkling from the first what he came for.
<q>Granting that you go through pride, still you had a hope that
Smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to Siberia, and Mitya
would be acquitted, while you would only be punished with moral
condemnation</q> (<q>Do you hear?</q> he laughed then)&mdash;<q>and some people
will praise you. But now Smerdyakov's dead, he has hanged himself,
and who'll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you are going,
you'll go all the same, you've decided to go. What are you going
for now?</q> That's awful, Alyosha. I can't endure such questions.
Who dare ask me such questions?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> interposed Alyosha&mdash;his heart sank with terror, but
he still seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason&mdash;<q>how could he
have told you of Smerdyakov's death before I came, when no one
knew of it and there was no time for any one to know of it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He told me,</q> said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. <q>It
<pb n='741'/><anchor id='Pg741'/>
was all he did talk about, if you come to that. <q>And it would be all
right if you believed in virtue,</q> he said. <q>No matter if they disbelieve
you, you are going for the sake of principle. But you are a
little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue?
Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to
any one? Because you don't know yourself why you go! Oh,
you'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go! And can you
have made up your mind? You've not made up your mind. You'll
sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go;
you know you'll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the
decision does not depend on you. You'll go because you won't dare
not to go. Why won't you dare? You must guess that for yourself.
That's a riddle for you!</q> He got up and went away. You
came and he went. He called me a coward, Alyosha!
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Le mot de l'énigme</foreign>
is that I am a coward. <q>It is not for such eagles to soar
above the earth.</q> It was he added that&mdash;he! And Smerdyakov said
the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I've seen that
for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! <q>You are
going in order to be praised.</q> That's a brutal lie! And you despise
me too, Alyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate
the monster, too! I hate the monster! I don't want to save the
monster. Let him rot in Siberia! He's begun singing a hymn!
Oh, to-morrow I'll go, stand before them, and spit in their faces!</q>
</p>

<p>
He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing
up and down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just
said. <q>I seem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but
I am asleep.</q> It seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did not
leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a
doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no
one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness
completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but
quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty.
Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support
him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed him
somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another
two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring,
breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on
the sofa, without undressing.
</p>

<pb n='742'/><anchor id='Pg742'/>

<p>
As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to
understand Ivan's illness. <q>The anguish of a proud determination.
An earnest conscience!</q> God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His
truth were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to
submit. <q>Yes,</q> the thought floated through Alyosha's head as it lay
on the pillow, <q>yes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe
Ivan's evidence; but he will go and give it.</q> Alyosha smiled softly.
<q>God will conquer!</q> he thought. <q>He will either rise up in the
light of truth, or ... he'll perish in hate, revenging on himself
and on every one his having served the cause he does not believe in,</q>
Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.

<head>Chapter I. The Fatal Day</head>

<p>
At ten o'clock in the morning of the day following the events I
have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our
district court.
</p>

<p>
I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself
capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail,
or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention
everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very
large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining
myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most interest
what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most
prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better not to
apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself
that I have done all I can.
</p>

<p>
And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention
what surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later,
every one was surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had
aroused great interest, that every one was burning with impatience
for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture,
exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society.
Every one knew, too, that the case had become known throughout
Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning,
such intense, interest in every one, not only among ourselves,
but all over Russia. This became evident at the trial this day.
</p>

<p>
Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province,
but from several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and
Petersburg. Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several
distinguished personages. Every ticket of admission had been
<pb n='744'/><anchor id='Pg744'/>
snatched up. A special place behind the table at which the three
judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and important
of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs had been placed there&mdash;something
exceptional, which had never been allowed before. A
large proportion&mdash;not less than half of the public&mdash;were ladies.
There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they
did not know where to seat them, for every ticket had long since
been eagerly sought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the
room, behind the platform, a special partition hurriedly put up,
behind which all these lawyers were admitted, and they thought
themselves lucky to have standing room there, for all chairs had
been removed for the sake of space, and the crowd behind the partition
stood throughout the case closely packed, shoulder to shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance,
made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the
majority of the ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed
hysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar fact&mdash;established
afterwards by many observations&mdash;was that almost
all the ladies, or, at least the vast majority of them, were on Mitya's
side and in favor of his being acquitted. This was perhaps chiefly
owing to his reputation as a conqueror of female hearts. It was
known that two women rivals were to appear in the case. One of
them&mdash;Katerina Ivanovna&mdash;was an object of general interest. All
sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes
of her passion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and <q>aristocratic
connections</q> were particularly insisted upon (she had
called upon scarcely any one in the town). People said she intended
to petition the Government for leave to accompany the criminal
to Siberia and to be married to him somewhere in the mines. The
appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited with no less impatience.
The public was looking forward with anxious curiosity to
the meeting of the two rivals&mdash;the proud aristocratic girl and <q>the
hetaira.</q> But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies
of the district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen <q>the
woman who had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,</q>
and all, almost without exception, wondered how father and son
could be so in love with <q>such a very common, ordinary Russian
girl, who was not even pretty.</q>
</p>

<pb n='745'/><anchor id='Pg745'/>

<p>
In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that
there were several serious family quarrels on Mitya's account in
our town. Many ladies quarreled violently with their husbands over
differences of opinion about the dreadful case, and it was only
natural that the husbands of these ladies, far from being favorably
disposed to the prisoner, should enter the court bitterly prejudiced
against him. In fact, one may say pretty certainly that the masculine,
as distinguished from the feminine, part of the audience were
biased against the prisoner. There were numbers of severe, frowning,
even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to offend
many people during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were,
of course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate
of Mitya personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the
majority of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the
criminal, except perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in
the legal than in the moral aspect of the case.
</p>

<p>
Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,
Fetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the
first time he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces.
And if he defended them, such cases became celebrated and long
remembered all over Russia. There were stories, too, about our
prosecutor and about the President of the Court. It was said that
Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and
that they had been enemies from the beginning of their careers in
Petersburg, that though our sensitive prosecutor, who always considered
that he had been aggrieved by some one in Petersburg because
his talents had not been properly appreciated, was keenly
excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of rebuilding
his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said,
was his one anxiety. But these rumors were not quite just. Our
prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger.
On the contrary, his self-confidence increased with the increase
of danger. It must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too
hasty and morbidly impressionable. He would put his whole soul
into some case and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole
fortune depended on its result. This was the subject of some ridicule
in the legal world, for just by this characteristic our prosecutor
had gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected

from his modest position. People laughed particularly at his passion
for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor
was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally
supposed. But with his delicate health he had failed to make his
mark at the outset of his career and had never made up for it later.
</p>

<p>
As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a
humane and cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his
work and progressive views. He was rather ambitious, but did not
concern himself greatly about his future career. The great aim of
his life was to be a man of advanced ideas. He was, too, a man
of connections and property. He felt, as we learnt afterwards,
rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a social, not
from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a social phenomenon,
in its classification and its character as a product of our
social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on, and
so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragic
significance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner,
was rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.
</p>

<p>
The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges
made their appearance. Our court is the best hall in the town&mdash;spacious,
lofty, and good for sound. On the right of the judges,
who were on a raised platform, a table and two rows of chairs had
been put ready for the jury. On the left was the place for the
prisoner and the counsel for the defense. In the middle of the court,
near the judges, was a table with the <q>material proofs.</q> On it lay
Fyodor Pavlovitch's white silk dressing-gown, stained with blood;
the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been
committed; Mitya's shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat,
stained with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put
his handkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by
now quite yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin's with a
view to suicide, and taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon
Borissovitch; the envelope in which the three thousand roubles had
been put ready for Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which
it had been tied, and many other articles I don't remember. In the
body of the hall, at some distance, came the seats for the public.
But in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for
witnesses who remained in the court after giving their evidence.

<p>
At ten o'clock the three judges arrived&mdash;the President, one
honorary justice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of
course, entered immediately after. The President was a short, stout,
thick-set man of fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair
turning gray and cut short, and a red ribbon, of what Order I don't
remember. The prosecutor struck me and the others, too, as looking
particularly pale, almost green. His face seemed to have grown
suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I had seen him looking
as usual only two days before. The President began with asking
the court whether all the jury were present.
</p>

<p>
But I see I can't go on like this, partly because some things I did
not hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but
most of all because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or
space to mention everything that was said and done. I only know
that neither side objected to very many of the jurymen. I remember
the twelve jurymen&mdash;four were petty officials of the town, two were
merchants, and six peasants and artisans of the town. I remember,
long before the trial, questions were continually asked with some
surprise, especially by ladies: <q>Can such a delicate, complex and
psychological case be submitted for decision to petty officials and
even peasants?</q> and <q>What can an official, still more a peasant,
understand in such an affair?</q> All the four officials in the jury were,
in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank. Except one who
was rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in
society, who had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably
had elderly, unpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps
even without shoes and stockings. At most, they spent their leisure
over cards and, of course, had never read a single book. The two
merchants looked respectable, but were strangely silent and stolid.
One of them was close-shaven, and was dressed in European style;
the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a red ribbon with some
sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need to speak of the
artisans and the peasants. The artisans of Skotoprigonyevsk are
almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of them also wore
European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier and more
uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might well wonder,
as I did as soon as I had looked at them, <q>what men like that could
possibly make of such a case?</q> Yet their faces made a strangely
<pb n='748'/><anchor id='Pg748'/>
imposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and
frowning.
</p>

<p>
At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor
Pavlovitch Karamazov. I don't quite remember how he described
him. The court usher was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya
made his appearance. There was a hush through the court. One
could have heard a fly. I don't know how it was with others, but
Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. He looked an
awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards that he
had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own
tailor, who had his measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves
and exquisite linen. He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking
stiffly straight in front of him, and sat down in his place with
a most unperturbed air.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated
Fetyukovitch, entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through
the court. He was a tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with
extremely long, thin, pale fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely
brushed, rather short hair, and thin lips that were at times curved
into something between a sneer and a smile. He looked about forty.
His face would have been pleasant, if it had not been for his eyes,
which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set remarkably
close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing line between
them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike
about his face. He was in evening dress and white tie.
</p>

<p>
I remember the President's first questions to Mitya, about his
name, his calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice
was so unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look
at the prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who
were to take part in the proceedings&mdash;that is, of the witnesses and
experts. It was a long list. Four of the witnesses were not present&mdash;Miüsov,
who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but
was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and Maximov, who were
absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his sudden death,
of which an official statement from the police was presented. The
news of Smerdyakov's death produced a sudden stir and whisper in
the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of the
sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya's sudden outburst
<pb n='749'/><anchor id='Pg749'/>
As soon as the statement of Smerdyakov's death was made,
he cried out aloud from his place:
</p>

<p>
<q>He was a dog and died like a dog!</q>
</p>

<p>
I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President
addressed him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an
irregularity were repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice
repeated several times abruptly to his counsel, with no show of
regret:
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't again, I won't. It escaped me. I won't do it again.</q>
</p>

<p>
And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury
or the public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself.
It was under the influence of this incident that the opening statement
was read. It was rather short, but circumstantial. It only
stated the chief reasons why he had been arrested, why he must be
tried, and so on. Yet it made a great impression on me. The clerk
read it loudly and distinctly. The whole tragedy was suddenly
unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless
light. I remember how, immediately after it had been read, the
President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:
</p>
