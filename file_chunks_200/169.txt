all my life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass
them together till our old age. Of course, on condition that you
will leave the monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time
fixed by the law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I
shall be walking and dancing. There can be no doubt of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>You see how I've thought of everything. There's only one thing
I can't imagine: what you'll think of me when you read this. I'm
always laughing and being naughty. I made you angry this morning,
but I assure you before I took up my pen, I prayed before the
Image of the Mother of God, and now I'm praying, and almost
crying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don't
know how I shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if
I can't restrain myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as
I did to-day. You'll think I'm a nasty girl making fun of you, and
you won't believe my letter. And so I beg you, dear one, if you've
any pity for me, when you come to-morrow, don't look me straight
in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it will be sure to make me laugh,
especially as you'll be in that long gown. I feel cold all over when
I think of it, so when you come, don't look at me at all for a time,
look at mamma or at the window....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here I've written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done?
Alyosha, don't despise me, and if I've done something very horrid
and wounded you, forgive me. Now the secret of my reputation,
ruined perhaps for ever, is in your hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our
<emph>awful</emph> meeting.&mdash;<hi rend='smallcaps'>Lise.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>P.S.&mdash;Alyosha! You must, must, must
come!&mdash;<hi rend='smallcaps'>Lise.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice,
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>
thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He
started. That laugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he
laughed again just as softly and happily. He slowly replaced the
note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down. The agitation
in his heart passed at once. <q>God, have mercy upon all of them,
have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set
them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them according
to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!</q>
Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.

<head>Chapter I. Father Ferapont</head>

<p>
Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima
woke up feeling very weak, though he wanted to get out of
bed and sit up in a chair. His mind was quite clear; his face looked
very tired, yet bright and almost joyful. It wore an expression of
gayety, kindness and cordiality. <q>Maybe I shall not live through
the coming day,</q> he said to Alyosha. Then he desired to confess
and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to Father
Païssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction
followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled
up by the inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight.
People began coming from the monastery. After the service was
over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one. As the
cell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for
others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was seated again in his
arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his voice was
weak, it was fairly steady.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been
talking aloud so many years, that I've got into the habit of talking,
and so much so that it's almost more difficult for me to hold my
tongue than to talk, even now, in spite of my weakness, dear
Fathers and brothers,</q> he jested, looking with emotion at the group
round him.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to
them. But though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly
steady, his speech was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many
<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>
things, he seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything
he had not said in his life, and not simply for the sake of
instructing them, but as though thirsting to share with all men and
all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more in his life to open his
whole heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Love one another, Fathers,</q> said Father Zossima, as far as
Alyosha could remember afterwards. <q>Love God's people. Because
we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no
holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the
very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he
is worse than others, than all men on earth.... And the longer
the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognize
that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he
realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible
to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national
and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For
know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for
all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general
sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and
every individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the
monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men,
but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge,
our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love.
Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole
world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your
tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess
your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even
when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions
with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither
to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who
insult you, who abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the
teachers of evil, the materialists&mdash;and I mean not only the good
ones&mdash;for there are many good ones among them, especially in our
day&mdash;hate not even the wicked ones. Remember them in your
prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none to pray for
them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not in
pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all
men.... Love God's people, let not strangers draw away the
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride,
or worse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and
draw away your flock. Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ...
be not extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver,
do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to the banner and raise
it on high.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported
his words afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though
to take breath, and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of
ecstasy. They heard him with emotion, though many wondered at
his words and found them obscure.... Afterwards all remembered
those words.
</p>

<p>
When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was
struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who
were crowding about it. This anticipation showed itself in some by
anxiety, in others by devout solemnity. All were expecting that
some marvel would happen immediately after the elder's death.
Their suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but
even the most austere of the monks were affected by it. Father
Païssy's face looked the gravest of all.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin,
who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from
Madame Hohlakov. In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and
very opportune incident. It appeared that among the women who
had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima's blessing,
there had been an old woman from the town, a sergeant's widow,
called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might pray for
the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk,
and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima
had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to
pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery.
He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added,
<q>as though reading the book of the future</q> (this was Madame
Hohlakov's expression), words of comfort: <q>that her son Vassya
was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly
or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.</q> And
<q>Would you believe it?</q> exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically,
<q>the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
that.</q> Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave
her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was
not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg,
Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an
official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped
<q>to embrace his mother.</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new
<q>miracle of prediction</q> to the Superior and all the brotherhood.
<q>All, all, ought to know of it!</q> she concluded. The letter had been
written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every
line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew
of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his
message <q>to inform most respectfully his reverence Father Païssy,
that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him, of such gravity
that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness
for his presumption.</q> As the monk had given the message to
Father Païssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading
the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to
Father Païssy in confirmation of the story.
</p>

<p>
And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as
he read the news of the <q>miracle,</q> could not completely restrain
some inner emotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn
smile came into his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see greater things!</q> broke from him.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall see greater things, greater things yet!</q> the monks
around repeated.
</p>

<p>
But Father Païssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least
for a time, not to speak of the matter <q>till it be more fully confirmed,
seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world,
and indeed this might well have chanced naturally,</q> he added,
prudently, as it were to satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing
his own disavowal, a fact his listeners very clearly perceived.
</p>

<p>
Within the hour the <q>miracle</q> was of course known to the whole
monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one
seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day
before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in
the far North. It was he who had been standing near Madame
Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly,
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>
referring to the <q>healing</q> of the lady's daughter, <q>How can you
presume to do such things?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe.
The evening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his
cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and
overawed by the visit. This Father Ferapont was that aged monk so
devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned already,
as antagonistic to Father Zossima and the whole institution
of <q>elders,</q> which he regarded as a pernicious and frivolous innovation.
He was a very formidable opponent, although from his practice
of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made
him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling,
and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and
ascetic, although they had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was
just his craziness attracted them.
</p>

<p>
Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived
in the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and
this too because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was
seventy-five or more, and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary
in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for
another great ascetic, Father Iona, who had lived to be a hundred
and five, and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still
extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in
this same solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant's
hut, though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary
number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them&mdash;which
men brought to the monastery as offerings to God. Father
Ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the lamps
burning. It was said (and indeed it was true) that he ate only two
pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper, who lived close by
the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three days, and even
to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely uttered a
word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament
bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the
Father Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug
was changed every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who
came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>
prayer without looking round. If he addressed them, he was brief,
abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. On very rare occasions,
however, he would talk to visitors, but for the most part he would
utter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle, and no
entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in explanation.
He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange belief,
chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had
communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with
them, and so was silent with men.
</p>

<p>
The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by
the beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to
the corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood. <q>Maybe he will speak
as you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him,</q> the
beekeeper had warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached
in the utmost apprehension. It was rather late in the
evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the door of his cell on a
low bench. A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead. There
was an evening freshness in the air. The monk from Obdorsk bowed
down before the saint and asked his blessing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?</q> said Father
Ferapont. <q>Get up!</q>
</p>

<p>
The monk got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come
from?</q>
</p>

<p>
What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his
strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous
old man. He was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh
and healthy face. There was no doubt he still had considerable
strength. He was of athletic build. In spite of his great age he was
not even quite gray, and still had very thick hair and a full beard,
both of which had once been black. His eyes were gray, large and
luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke with a broad accent.
He was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of coarse convict
cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round his waist.
His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of the
coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been
changed for months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>
pounds under his coat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old
slippers almost dropping to pieces.
</p>

<p>
<q>From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,</q> the
monk answered humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather
frightened little eyes kept watch on the hermit.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester
well?</q>
</p>

<p>
The monk hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During
Lent there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. For Tuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed
fruit with honey, wild berries, or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout.
On Saturday white cabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha,
all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with
the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening, six whole
days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and
water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just
the same as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing
is eaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till
three o'clock, and then take a little bread and water and drink a
single cup of wine. On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have
something cooked without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as the
Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday: <q>It is unseemly
by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonor the whole
of Lent!</q> This is how we keep the fast. But what is that compared
with you, holy Father,</q> added the monk, growing more confident,
<q>for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but
bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full
seven. It's truly marvelous&mdash;your great abstinence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And mushrooms?</q> asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mushrooms?</q> repeated the surprised monk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go
away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries,
but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage
to the devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of
such fasting. Haughty and unclean is their judgment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Och, true,</q> sighed the monk.
</p>

<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>

<p>
<q>And have you seen devils among them?</q> asked Ferapont.
</p>

<p>
<q>Among them? Among whom?</q> asked the monk, timidly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I
haven't been since. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding
under his cassock, only his horns poked out; another had one peeping
out of his pocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me;
another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was hanging
round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him about without
seeing him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You&mdash;can see spirits?</q> the monk inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming
out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the
door, and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick
long gray tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door
and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He
squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over
him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed spider.
He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking, but they
don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have been there.
I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,</q> said
the monk, growing bolder and bolder, <q>is it true, as they noise
abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual
communication with the Holy Ghost?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He does fly down at times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he fly down? In what form?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As a bird.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's the Holy Ghost and there's the Holy Spirit. The Holy
Spirit can appear as other birds&mdash;sometimes as a swallow, sometimes
a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue-tit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know him from an ordinary tit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he speak, in what language?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Human language.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what does he tell you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would
ask me unseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.</q>
</p>

<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>

<p>
<q>Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,</q> the
monk shook his head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened
little eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you see this tree?</q> asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do, blessed Father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What sort of shape?</q> inquired the monk, after a pause of vain
expectation.
</p>

<p>
<q>It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night
it is Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those
arms, I see it clearly and tremble. It's terrible, terrible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, He'll snatch me up and carry me away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alive?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard? He will
take me in His arms and bear me away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one
of the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished
at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father
Zossima. He was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not
strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should
<q>see marvels.</q> His words seemed certainly queer, but God only
could tell what was hidden in those words, and were not worse
words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their
intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the devil's tail
he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the figurative
sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong
prejudice against the institution of <q>elders,</q> which he only knew
of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before
he had been long at the monastery, he had detected the
secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the
institution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who
poked his nose into everything. This was why the news of the
fresh <q>miracle</q> performed by Father Zossima reduced him to
extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their
inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting
to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions
among the monks that were crowding within and without the
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
elder's cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at the time,
and only recollected it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima,
feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of
Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran
at once. There was no one else in the cell but Father Païssy, Father
Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The elder, opening his weary eyes
and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Are your people expecting you, my son?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha hesitated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise some one yesterday
to see them to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did promise&mdash;to my father&mdash;my brothers&mdash;others too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die
without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say
that word, my son, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear
son, because you love me. But now go to keep your promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the
promise that he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be
the last gift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his
soul. He made haste that he might finish what he had to do in
the town and return quickly. Father Païssy, too, uttered some
words of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly. He
spoke as they left the cell together.
</p>

<p>
<q>Remember, young man, unceasingly,</q> Father Païssy began,
without preface, <q>that the science of this world, which has become
a great power, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything
divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel
analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was
sacred of old. But they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked
the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole
still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it
not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the
masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the souls
of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who
have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being
still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal
of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When
it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque. Remember
this especially, young man, since you are being sent into the
world by your departing elder. Maybe, remembering this great
day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the heart for your
guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the world
are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my
orphan.</q>
</p>

<p>
With these words Father Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the
monastery and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he
had met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in
this austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as
though Father Zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and
<q>perhaps that's just what had passed between them,</q> Alyosha
thought suddenly. The philosophic reflections he had just heard
so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Païssy's heart.
He was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation
and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest
defense he could imagine.

<head>Chapter II. At His Father's</head>

<p>
First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered
that his father had insisted the day before that he
should come without his brother Ivan seeing him. <q>Why so?</q> Alyosha
wondered suddenly. <q>Even if my father has something to say
to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his excitement
yesterday he meant to say something different,</q> he decided.
Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden
gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),
told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone
out two hours ago.
</p>

<p>
<q>And my father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is up, taking his coffee,</q> Marfa answered somewhat dryly.
</p>

<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>

<p>
Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table
wearing slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself
by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however.
He was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out
marketing. Though he had got up early and was trying to put a
bold face on it, he looked tired and weak. His forehead, upon which
huge purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged
with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen terribly in the
night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his
whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old man
was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he
came in.
</p>

<p>
<q>The coffee is cold,</q> he cried harshly; <q>I won't offer you any.
I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't
invite any one to share it. Why have you come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To find out how you are,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence.
You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking
in directly.</q>
</p>

<p>
He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he
got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the
fortieth time that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his
red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,</q> he observed
sententiously. <q>Well, how are things over there? How is
your elder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is very bad; he may die to-day,</q> answered Alyosha. But
his father had not listened, and had forgotten his own question
at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan's gone out,</q> he said suddenly. <q>He is doing his utmost
to carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,</q>
he added maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely he did not tell you so?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three
weeks ago? You don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you?
He must have had some object in coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? Why do you say such things?</q> said Alyosha,
troubled.
</p>

<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>

<p>
<q>He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a farthing
from me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well
know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing,
and the longer I live, the more I shall need it,</q> he continued, pacing
from one corner of the room to the other, keeping his hands in the
pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material.
<q>I can still pass for a man at five and fifty, but I want to pass for
one for another twenty years. As I get older, you know, I shan't be
a pretty object. The wenches won't come to me of their own accord,
so I shall want my money. So I am saving up more and more,
simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may as
well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell
you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others
do it on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall
upon me for being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it's not the
proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I
believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all.
You can pray for my soul if you like. And if you don't want to,
don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan talked well here
yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a conceited coxcomb,
but he has no particular learning ... nor education either. He
sits silent and smiles at one without speaking&mdash;that's what pulls him
through.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened to him in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself
airs. Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a
minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
you have only to want a thing and you can have it. That's what
Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to prevent me getting married
and that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself.
He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I should
leave him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries
Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what
he's reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better
lie down,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>There! you say that,</q> the old man observed suddenly, as though
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
it had struck him for the first time, <q>and I am not angry with you.
But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you
I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not ill-natured, but distorted,</q> said Alyosha with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked
up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course
in these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a
prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your
old father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own
house, and brag of murdering him outright&mdash;all in the presence of
witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked
up at once for what he did yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you don't mean to take proceedings?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's
another thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to see
him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old
man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to
me.... For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know
her through and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy?
Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy
into it, it's delicious, my boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may,</q> said
Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket
of his cassock. <q>And you'd better not have brandy, either,</q> he
suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing
them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.</q>
</p>

<p>
He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then
locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough. One glass won't kill me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see you are in a better humor now,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels
I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya&mdash;why is that?
He wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
are all scoundrels! But I don't recognize Ivan, I don't know him
at all. Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As
though I'd leave him anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may
as well know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles
at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on
them. And your Mitya will squelch too. <emph>Your</emph> Mitya, for you love
him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him.
But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving
him. But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like
Ivan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust.
When the wind blows, the dust will be gone.... I had a silly idea
in my head when I told you to come to-day; I wanted to find out
from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a thousand or
maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself
off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without
Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I&mdash;I'll ask him,</q> muttered Alyosha. <q>If you would give him
three thousand, perhaps he&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've
changed my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give
him anything, not a penny, I want my money myself,</q> cried the old
man, waving his hand. <q>I'll crush him like a beetle without it.
Don't say anything to him or else he will begin hoping. There's
nothing for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is that betrothed of
his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully hidden from
me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see her
yesterday, I believe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing will induce her to abandon him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and
a scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young
ladies, very different from&mdash;Ah, if I had his youth and the looks
I had then (for I was better-looking than he at eight and twenty)
I'd have been a conquering hero just as he is. He is a low cad!
But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he shan't! I'll crush him!</q>
</p>

<p>
His anger had returned with the last words.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,</q> he
snapped harshly.
</p>

<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>

<p>
Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's that for?</q> The old man was a little surprised. <q>We
shall see each other again, or do you think we shan't?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all, I didn't mean anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nor did I, I did not mean anything,</q> said the old man, looking
at him. <q>Listen, listen,</q> he shouted after him, <q>make haste and
come again and I'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like
to-day. Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!</q>
</p>

<p>
And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the
cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have more!</q> he muttered, clearing his throat, and again
he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he
went into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one
minute he was asleep.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys</head>

<p>
<q>Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,</q>
thought Alyosha, as he left his father's house and turned
towards Madame Hohlakov's, <q>or I might have to tell him of my
meeting with Grushenka yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had
renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again.
<q>Father is spiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick
to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday,
he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made
some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to-day, whatever
happens.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on
the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a
great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and
turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is
divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between
the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home
from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with
leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in
little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round
the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear.
The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently
holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been
able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although
he was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he liked
schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious as he was to-day,
he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He looked into
their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had
stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,
there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a
satchel at his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking
and with sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and
anxious watch on the other six, obviously his schoolfellows with
whom he had just come out of school, but with whom he had evidently
had a feud.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy
in a black jacket, observed:
</p>

<p>
<q>When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry
it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got
yours on your right side. So it will be awkward for you to get
at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical
remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get
at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more with a
group of children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way
so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it
by instinct.
</p>

<p>
<q>But he is left-handed,</q> another, a fine healthy-looking boy of
eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>He even throws stones with his left hand,</q> observed a third.
</p>

<p>
At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed
the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by
the boy standing the other side of the ditch.
</p>

<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>

<p>
<q>Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,</q> they all shouted. But
Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged
himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the
ground. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose
coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the
group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully
on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov,
Karamazov!</q> the boys shouted, laughing. <q>Come, all throw at him
at once!</q> and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the
head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously
returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many
of the group had their pockets full too.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one!
Why, you'll kill him,</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary
boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>He began first!</q> cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish
voice. <q>He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day
with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he
must be thrashed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what for? I suppose you tease him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,</q> cried
the children. <q>It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all
of you, at him again, don't miss, Smurov!</q> and again a fire of stones,
and a very vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch
was hit in the chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill
towards Mihailovsky Street. They all shouted: <q>Aha, he is funking,
he is running away. Wisp of tow!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too
good for him,</q> said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He
seemed to be the eldest.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's wrong with him?</q> asked Alyosha, <q>is he a tell-tale or
what?</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?</q> the same boy went
on. <q>Catch him up.... You see he's stopped again, he is waiting
and looking at you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>

<p>
<q>He is looking at you,</q> the other boys chimed in.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you
hear, ask him that!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them,
and they at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't go near him, he'll hurt you,</q> cried Smurov in a warning
voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease
him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why
you hate him so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Find out then, find out,</q> cried the boys, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence,
straight towards the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better look out,</q> the boys called after him; <q>he won't
be afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did
Krassotkin.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him,
Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an
undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes
that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby
old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms
stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right
knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a
big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the
pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha
stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The
boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him,
became less defiant, and addressed him first.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone!</q>
he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,</q> observed
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I hit Smurov on the head!</q> cried the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone
at me on purpose,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
The boy looked darkly at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know you. Do you know me?</q> Alyosha continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me alone!</q> the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive
light in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, I am going,</q> said Alyosha; <q>only I don't know you
and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I
don't want to tease you. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Monk in silk trousers!</q> cried the boy, following Alyosha with
the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself
into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would
fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked
away. He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the
boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then,
when they say that you attack on the sly,</q> said Alyosha, turning
round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into
Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the
stone struck him on the elbow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would
attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like
a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha
had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with
both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and
it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain
and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at
last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's finger had been
badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha
took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured
hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting
all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well,</q> he said, <q>you see how badly you've bitten me.
That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
The boy stared in amazement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,</q>
Alyosha went on with the same serenity, <q>yet I must have done
something to you&mdash;you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.
So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky
Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the distance
as fast as ever, not turning his head, and no doubt still keeping up
his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as soon as
he had time, and to solve this mystery. Just now he had not the
time.

<head>Chapter IV. At The Hohlakovs'</head>

<p>
Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome
stone house of two stories, one of the finest in our town.
Though Madame Hohlakov spent most of her time in another province
where she had an estate, or in Moscow, where she had a house
of her own, yet she had a house in our town too, inherited from her
