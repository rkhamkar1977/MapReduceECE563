been taught. I'm not <q>old fellow</q> to you, and you can keep your
advice for another time!</q> Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out
savagely, as though glad to vent his wrath.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment
later he felt suddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull
<pb n='577'/><anchor id='Pg577'/>
sky was still overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing
straight in his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've taken a chill,</q> thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down
heavily, and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into
the corner. It is true that he was out of humor and greatly disliked
the task that had been laid upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Trifon Borissovitch!</q> Mitya shouted again, and felt
himself, that he had not called out this time from good-nature, but
involuntarily, from resentment.
</p>

<p>
But Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind
his back, and staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face,
he made no reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by!</q> he heard all at once
the voice of Kalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up
to the cart he held out his hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.
</p>

<p>
Mitya had time to seize and press his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, dear fellow! I shan't forget your generosity,</q> he cried
warmly.
</p>

<p>
But the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began
ringing and Mitya was driven off.
</p>

<p>
Kalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his
face in his hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat
like that, crying as though he were a little boy instead of a young
man of twenty. Oh, he believed almost without doubt in Mitya's
guilt.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are these people? What can men be after this?</q> he exclaimed
incoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that
moment he had no desire to live.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it worth it? Is it worth it?</q> exclaimed the boy in his grief.

<head>Chapter I. Kolya Krassotkin</head>

<p>
It was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost,
eleven degrees RÃ©aumur, without snow, but a little dry snow
had fallen on the frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry
wind was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our
town, especially about the market-place. It was a dull morning,
but the snow had ceased.
</p>

<p>
Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov's shop, there
stood a small house, very clean both without and within. It belonged
to Madame Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial
secretary, who had been dead for fourteen years. His widow, still a
nice-looking woman of thirty-two, was living in her neat little
house on her private means. She lived in respectable seclusion; she
was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition. She was about eighteen
at the time of her husband's death; she had been married only a year
and had just borne him a son. From the day of his death she had
devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her precious
treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionately
those fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than
happiness. She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost
every day, afraid he would fall ill, would catch cold, do something
naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When
Kolya began going to school, the mother devoted herself to studying
all the sciences with him so as to help him, and go through his
lessons with him. She hastened to make the acquaintance of the
teachers and their wives, even made up to Kolya's schoolfellows,
<pb n='579'/><anchor id='Pg579'/>
and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being
teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far that the boys
actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him with
being a <q>mother's darling.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy,
<q>tremendously strong,</q> as was rumored in his class, and soon proved
to be the fact; he was agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and
enterprising temper. He was good at lessons, and there was a
rumor in the school that he could beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at
arithmetic and universal history. Though he looked down upon
every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious. He accepted
his schoolfellows' respect as his due, but was friendly with them.
Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himself
on occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped
that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an
unpardonable breach of discipline. But he was as fond of mischief
on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school, and
not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation,
inventing something, something effective and conspicuous. He was
extremely vain. He knew how to make even his mother give way
to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her. She gave
way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The one
thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love
for her. She was always fancying that Kolya was <q>unfeeling</q> to
her, and at times, dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach
him with his coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more
demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him the more he seemed
intentionally to avoid them. Yet it was not intentional on his part
but instinctive&mdash;it was his character. His mother was mistaken;
he was very fond of her. He only disliked <q>sheepish sentimentality,</q>
as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.
</p>

<p>
There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that
had been his father's. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read
several of them by himself. His mother did not mind that and only
wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase
poring over a book instead of going to play. And in that way
Kolya read some things unsuitable for his age.
</p>

<p>
Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his
<pb n='580'/><anchor id='Pg580'/>
mischief, he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother
serious alarm. It is true there was nothing vicious in what he did,
but a wild mad recklessness.
</p>

<p>
It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the
mother and son went to another district, forty-five miles away, to
spend a week with a distant relation, whose husband was an official
at the railway station (the very station, the nearest one to our town,
from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for
Moscow). There Kolya began by carefully investigating every
detail connected with the railways, knowing that he could impress
his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired knowledge.
But there happened to be some other boys in the place with
whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the
station, others in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them,
all between twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our
town. The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day of
Kolya's stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish boys.
Kolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked
down upon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity or
by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down
between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due,
and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him
at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation,
from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between
the rails that the train could pass over without touching, but to lie
there was no joke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At
first they laughed at him, called him a little liar, a braggart, but
that only egged him on. What piqued him most was that these boys
of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously, and were
at first disposed to treat him as <q>a small boy,</q> not fit to associate
with them, and that was an unendurable insult.
</p>

<p>
And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from
the station, so that the train might have time to get up full speed
after leaving the station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark
night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down
between the rails. The five others who had taken the bet waited
among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with
suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last they
<pb n='581'/><anchor id='Pg581'/>
heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.
Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared
as it approached.
</p>

<p>
<q>Run, run away from the rails,</q> the boys cried to Kolya from the
bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted
up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving.
They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got
up and walked away without a word. Then he explained that he
had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them, but the
fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed long
after to his mother. In this way his reputation as <q>a desperate character,</q>
was established for ever. He returned home to the station as
white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervous fever,
but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. The incident
did not become known at once, but when they came back to
the town it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of
the masters. But then Kolya's mother hastened to entreat the
masters on her boy's behalf, and in the end Dardanelov, a respected
and influential teacher, exerted himself in his favor, and the affair
was ignored.
</p>

<p>
Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately
in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had
once already, about a year previously, ventured, trembling with fear
and the delicacy of his sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his
hand in marriage. But she refused him resolutely, feeling that to
accept him would be an act of treachery to her son, though Dardanelov
had, to judge from certain mysterious symptoms, reason for
believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming but
too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya's mad prank seemed to
have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for his intercession
by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, was a
faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and
delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly
happy. He was fond of the boy, though he would have felt
it beneath him to try and win him over, and was severe and strict
with him in class. Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance.
He learned his lessons perfectly; he was second in his class, was reserved
with Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that
<pb n='582'/><anchor id='Pg582'/>
Kolya was so good at universal history that he could <q>beat</q> even
Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, <q>Who founded
Troy?</q> to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring
to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the
period, to the mythical legends. But the question, <q>Who had
founded Troy?</q> that is, what individuals, he could not answer, and
even for some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous.
But the boys remained convinced that Dardanelov did not know
who founded Troy. Kolya had read of the founders of Troy in
Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in his father's
bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the question,
who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell
his secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.
</p>

<p>
After the incident on the railway a certain change came over
Kolya's attitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame
Krassotkin) heard of her son's exploit, she almost went out of her
mind with horror. She had such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting
with intervals for several days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at
last, promised on his honor that such pranks should never be repeated.
He swore on his knees before the holy image, and swore by the
memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin's instance, and the
<q>manly</q> Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And all that day
the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other's arms
sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as <q>unfeeling</q> as before, but he
had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even
brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was
a scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as
it turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in
it. But of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but
the more uneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov.
It must be noted that Kolya understood and divined what
was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised him profoundly
for his <q>feelings</q>; he had in the past been so tactless as to show this
contempt before his mother, hinting vaguely that he knew what
Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the railway incident
his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not allow
himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more
<pb n='583'/><anchor id='Pg583'/>
respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive
woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the
slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya's presence, she
would flush as pink as a rose. At such moments Kolya would either
stare out of the window scowling, or would investigate the state of
his boots, or would shout angrily for <q>Perezvon,</q> the big, shaggy,
mangy dog, which he had picked up a month before, brought home,
and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not showing him to any
of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully, teaching him all
sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he
was absent at school, and when he came in, whined with delight,
rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground
pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he
had taught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the
zeal of his excited and grateful heart.
</p>

<p>
I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin
was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to
the reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending
his father when the schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the
nickname <q>wisp of tow.</q>

<head>Chapter II. Children</head>

<p>
And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November,
Kolya Krassotkin was sitting at home. It was Sunday and
there was no school. It had just struck eleven, and he particularly
wanted to go out <q>on very urgent business,</q> but he was left alone
in charge of the house, for it so happened that all its elder inmates
were absent owing to a sudden and singular event. Madame Krassotkin
had let two little rooms, separated from the rest of the house
by a passage, to a doctor's wife with her two small children. This
lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great friend of
hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve
months before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and
for the last six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it
<pb n='584'/><anchor id='Pg584'/>
not been for her friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was
some consolation to the forsaken lady, she would certainly have
completely dissolved away in tears. And now, to add to her misfortunes,
Katerina, her only servant, was suddenly moved the evening
before to announce, to her mistress's amazement, that she proposed
to bring a child into the world before morning. It seemed
almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed the probability
of it before. The astounded doctor's wife decided to move
Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town
kept by a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by
her servant, she promptly carried out this plan and remained there
looking after her. By the morning all Madame Krassotkin's friendly
sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance and appeal
to some one for help in the case.
</p>

<p>
So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins'
servant, Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus
left for a time to protect and look after <q>the kids,</q> that is, the
son and daughter of the doctor's wife, who were left alone. Kolya
was not afraid of taking care of the house, besides he had Perezvon,
who had been told to lie flat, without moving, under the bench in
the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro through the rooms,
came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two loud and
insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the whistle did
not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the luckless dog,
who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that
troubled Kolya was <q>the kids.</q> He looked, of course, with the
utmost scorn on Katerina's unexpected adventure, but he was very
fond of the bereaved <q>kiddies,</q> and had already taken them a picture-book.
Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and Kostya,
the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her. Krassotkin
could, of course, have provided more diverting entertainment for
them. He could have made them stand side by side and played
soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the house. He had
done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so much
so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses
with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side
like a trace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust,
pointing out that to play horses with boys of one's own age, boys of
<pb n='585'/><anchor id='Pg585'/>
thirteen, would certainly be disgraceful <q>at this date,</q> but that he
did it for the sake of <q>the kids</q> because he liked them, and no one
had a right to call him to account for his feelings. The two <q>kids</q>
adored him.
</p>

<p>
But on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very
important business of his own before him, something almost mysterious.
Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya, with whom he could
have left the children, would not come back from market. He
had several times already crossed the passage, opened the door of
the lodgers' room and looked anxiously at <q>the kids</q> who were sitting
over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he opened
the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would
do something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and
did not go in.
</p>

<p>
At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all,
that if that <q>damned</q> Agafya did not come back within ten minutes
he should go out without waiting for her, making <q>the kids</q>
promise, of course, to be brave when he was away, not to be naughty,
not to cry from fright. With this idea he put on his wadded
winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar, slung his satchel round
his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother's constantly reiterated
entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in such cold
weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and
went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdoor
clothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor
with his tail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine.
But Kolya, seeing his dog's passionate excitement, decided that it
was a breach of discipline, kept him for another minute under the
bench, and only when he had opened the door into the passage,
whistled for him. The dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed
bounding before him rapturously.
</p>

<p>
Kolya opened the door to peep at <q>the kids.</q> They were both
sitting as before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing
about something. The children often argued together about various
exciting problems of life, and Nastya, being the elder, always got
the best of it. If Kostya did not agree with her, he almost always
appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his verdict was regarded as
infallible by both of them. This time the <q>kids'</q> discussion rather
<pb n='586'/><anchor id='Pg586'/>
interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage to listen.
The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute with
even greater energy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall never, never believe,</q> Nastya prattled, <q>that the old
women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It's
winter now and there are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn't
have taken Katerina a daughter.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya whistled to himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to
those who are married.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nastya, how silly you are!</q> he said at last, firmly and calmly.
<q>How can Katerina have a baby when she isn't married?</q>
</p>

<p>
Nastya was exasperated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know nothing about it,</q> she snapped irritably. <q>Perhaps
she has a husband, only he is in prison, so now she's got a baby.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But is her husband in prison?</q> the matter-of-fact Kostya
inquired gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Or, I tell you what,</q> Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely
rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. <q>She hasn't a
husband, you are right there, but she wants to be married, and so
she's been thinking of getting married, and thinking and thinking
of it till now she's got it, that is, not a husband but a baby.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, perhaps so,</q> Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. <q>But
you didn't say so before. So how could I tell?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, kiddies,</q> said Kolya, stepping into the room. <q>You're
terrible people, I see.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And Perezvon with you!</q> grinned Kostya, and began snapping
his fingers and calling Perezvon.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am in a difficulty, kids,</q> Krassotkin began solemnly, <q>and
you must help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has
not turned up till now, that's certain. I must go out. Will you
let me go?</q>
</p>

<p>
The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces
showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what
was expected of them.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on
<pb n='587'/><anchor id='Pg587'/>
the cupboard and break your legs? You won't be frightened alone
and cry?</q>
</p>

<p>
A look of profound despondency came into the children's faces.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper
cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder.</q>
</p>

<p>
The children's faces instantly brightened. <q>Show us the cannon,</q>
said Kostya, beaming all over.
</p>

<p>
Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little
bronze cannon stood it on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels.</q> He rolled
the toy on along the table. <q>And it can be fired off, too. It can
be loaded with shot and fired off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And it could kill any one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It can kill any one; you've only got to aim at anybody,</q> and
Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the
shot should be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and
told them that it kicked when it was fired.
</p>

<p>
The children listened with intense interest. What particularly
struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked.
</p>

<p>
<q>And have you got any powder?</q> Nastya inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Show us the powder, too,</q> she drawled with a smile of entreaty.
</p>

<p>
Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small
flask containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in
a screw of paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little
powder into the palm of his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow
up and kill us all,</q> Krassotkin warned them sensationally.
</p>

<p>
The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that
only intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.
</p>

<p>
<q>And does the shot burn?</q> he inquired.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it doesn't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me a little shot,</q> he asked in an imploring voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it to your
mother till I come back, or she'll be sure to think it's gunpowder,
and will die of fright and give you a thrashing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother never does whip us,</q> Nastya observed at once.
</p>

<pb n='588'/><anchor id='Pg588'/>

<p>
<q>I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don't you
ever deceive your mother except just this once, until I come back.
And so, kiddies, can I go out? You won't be frightened and cry
when I'm gone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We sha&mdash;all cry,</q> drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,</q> Nastya chimed in with
timid haste.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years!
There's no help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I
don't know how long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!</q> Kostya begged.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. <hi rend='italic'>Ici</hi>,
Perezvon.</q> And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed
all his tricks.
</p>

<p>
He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort
of lilac-gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear
was torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind
legs, lay on his back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were
dead. While this last performance was going on, the door opened
and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's servant, a stout woman of forty,
marked with small-pox, appeared in the doorway. She had come
back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand.
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to
watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return,
he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon
dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog jumped
up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only think, a dog!</q> Agafya observed sententiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you late, female?</q> asked Krassotkin sternly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brat?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you may
be sure I have good reason,</q> muttered Agafya, busying herself
about the stove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice.
She seemed quite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry
young master.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you frivolous young woman,</q> Krassotkin began, getting
up from the sofa, <q>can you swear by all you hold sacred in the
<pb n='589'/><anchor id='Pg589'/>
world and something else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over
the kids in my absence? I am going out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what am I going to swear for?</q> laughed Agafya. <q>I shall
look after them without that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, don't then. What does it matter to me? It's cold out;
stay at home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Kids,</q> Kolya turned to the children, <q>this woman will stay with
you till I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to
have been back long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You'll
give them something, Agafya, won't you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That I can do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you,
granny,</q> he added gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, <q>I
hope you'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your
old woman's nonsense about Katerina. <hi rend='italic'>Ici</hi>, Perezvon!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Get along with you!</q> retorted Agafya, really angry this time.
<q>Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things,
that's what you want!</q>
</p>

<head>Chapter III. The Schoolboy</head>

<p>
But Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he
went out at the gate he looked round him, shrugged up his
shoulders, and saying <q>It is freezing,</q> went straight along the street
and turned off to the right towards the market-place. When he
reached the last house but one before the market-place he stopped at
the gate, pulled a whistle out of his pocket, and whistled with all
his might as though giving a signal. He had not to wait more
than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven, wearing
a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This
was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya
Krassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden
by his parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known
to be a desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping
<pb n='590'/><anchor id='Pg590'/>
out on the sly. He was&mdash;if the reader has not forgotten&mdash;one of the
group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha.
He was the one who told Alyosha Karamazov about Ilusha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,</q> said
Smurov stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am late,</q> answered Krassotkin. <q>I was detained by circumstances.
You won't be thrashed for coming with me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, I say, I'm never thrashed! And you've got Perezvon with
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're taking him, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's impossible. Zhutchka's non-existent. Zhutchka is lost
in the mists of obscurity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! couldn't we do this?</q> Smurov suddenly stood still. <q>You
see Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking
dog like Perezvon. Couldn't you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he
might believe you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Boy, shun a lie, that's one thing; even with a good object&mdash;that's
another. Above all, I hope you've not told them anything about
my coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won't comfort
him with Perezvon,</q> said Smurov, with a sigh. <q>You know his
father, the captain, <q>the wisp of tow,</q> told us that he was going
to bring him a real mastiff pup, with a black nose, to-day. He
thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I doubt it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how is Ilusha?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he's in consumption: he is
quite conscious, but his breathing! His breathing's gone wrong.
The other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the
room. He tried to walk, but he couldn't stand. <q>Ah, I told you
before, father,</q> he said, <q>that those boots were no good. I could
never walk properly in them.</q> He fancied it was his boots that
made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really. He won't
live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they
are rich again&mdash;they've got heaps of money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They are rogues.</q>
</p>

<pb n='591'/><anchor id='Pg591'/>

<p>
<q>Who are rogues?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of
course, individually. I don't believe in medicine. It's a useless institution.
I mean to go into all that. But what's that sentimentality
you've got up there? The whole class seems to be there every day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not the whole class: it's only ten of our fellows who go to see
him every day. There's nothing in that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What I don't understand in all this is the part that Alexey
Karamazov is taking in it. His brother's going to be tried to-morrow
or next day for such a crime, and yet he has so much time to
spend on sentimentality with boys.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now
to make it up with Ilusha.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow
no one to analyze my actions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that
you are coming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn't come all
this time?</q> Smurov cried with sudden warmth.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear boy, that's my business, not yours. I am going of myself
because I choose to, but you've all been hauled there by Alexey
Karamazov&mdash;there's a difference, you know. And how do you
know? I may not be going to make it up at all. It's a stupid
expression.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not Karamazov at all; it's not his doing. Our fellows began
going there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov
at first. And there's been nothing of that sort&mdash;no silliness. First
one went, and then another. His father was awfully pleased to see
us. You know he will simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies.
He sees that Ilusha's dying. And he seems so glad we've made it up
with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that was all. He just asks
and says no more. His father will go out of his mind or hang
himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very
decent man. We made a mistake then. It's all the fault of that
murderer who beat him then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov's a riddle to me all the same. I might have made
his acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in
some cases. Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work
out and verify.</q>
</p>

<pb n='592'/><anchor id='Pg592'/>

<p>
Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent.
Smurov, of course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of
putting himself on a level with him. Now he was tremendously interested
at Kolya's saying that he was <q>going of himself</q> to see
Ilusha. He felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya's suddenly
taking it into his head to go to him that day. They crossed
the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded wagons
from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market
women were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths.
These Sunday markets were naÃ¯vely called <q>fairs</q> in the town, and
there were many such fairs in the year.
</p>

<p>
Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one
side, then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt
each other over according to the rules of canine etiquette.
</p>

<p>
<q>I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,</q> said Kolya suddenly.
<q>Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they
meet? It seems to be a law of their nature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; it's a funny habit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's not funny; you are wrong there. There's nothing funny
in nature, however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices.
If dogs could reason and criticize us they'd be sure to find just as
much that would be funny to them, if not far more, in the social
relations of men, their masters&mdash;far more, indeed. I repeat that,
because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us.
That's Rakitin's idea&mdash;a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist, Smurov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what is a Socialist?</q> asked Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's when all are equal and all have property in common,
there are no marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he
likes best, and all the rest of it. You are not old enough to understand
that yet. It's cold, though.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer
just now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we
don't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of
frost as we do now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden
frost of twelve degrees, especially when there is not much snow.
It's because people are not used to it. Everything is habit with men,
<pb n='593'/><anchor id='Pg593'/>
everything even in their social and political relations. Habit is the
great motive-power. What a funny-looking peasant!</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance
in a long sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping
together his hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them.
His long fair beard was all white with frost.
</p>

<p>
<q>That peasant's beard's frozen,</q> Kolya cried in a loud provocative
voice as he passed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lots of people's beards are frozen,</q> the peasant replied, calmly
and sententiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't provoke him,</q> observed Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's all right; he won't be cross; he's a nice fellow. Good-by,
Matvey.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is your name Matvey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Didn't you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't. It was a guess.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You get whipped, I expect?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing to speak of&mdash;sometimes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Does it hurt?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, yes, it does.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ech, what a life!</q> The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom
of his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Matvey.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
The boys went on.
</p>

<p>
<q>That was a nice peasant,</q> Kolya observed to Smurov. <q>I like
talking to the peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?</q> asked
Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>I had to say that to please him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know, Smurov, I don't like being asked the same thing twice.
I like people to understand at the first word. Some things can't be
explained. According to a peasant's notions, schoolboys are whipped,
and must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not
<pb n='594'/><anchor id='Pg594'/>
whipped? And if I were to tell him we are not, he'd be disappointed.
But you don't understand that. One has to know how
to talk to the peasants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only don't tease them, please, or you'll get into another scrape
as you did about that goose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you're afraid?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't laugh, Kolya. Of course I'm afraid. My father would be
awfully cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!</q>
he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths.
</p>

<p>
<q>Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,</q> the middle-aged
market woman shouted at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so glad it's Marya. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm in a hurry. I can't stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.</q>
Kolya waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked
him and not he her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you
impudent young monkey. I didn't say anything,</q> bawled Marya.
<q>You want a whipping, that's what you want, you saucy jackanapes!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a roar of laughter among the other market women
round her. Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the
arcade of shops close by. He was a young man, not a native of
the town, with dark, curly hair and a long, pale face, marked with
smallpox. He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap, and looked
like a merchant's clerk. He was in a state of stupid excitement and
brandished his fist at Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you!</q> he cried angrily, <q>I know you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have
had a row with the man. But he had been in so many rows in the
street that he could hardly remember them all.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you?</q> he asked sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you! I know you!</q> the man repeated idiotically.
</p>

<p>
<q>So much the better for you. Well, it's time I was going.
Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are at your saucy pranks again?</q> cried the man. <q>You are
at your saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!</q>
</p>

<pb n='595'/><anchor id='Pg595'/>

<p>
<q>It's not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks
again,</q> said Kolya, standing still and scanning him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not my business?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; it's not your business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's Trifon Nikititch's business, not yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What Trifon Nikititch?</q> asked the youth, staring with loutish
amazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.
</p>

<p>
Kolya scanned him gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?</q> he suddenly
asked him, with stern emphasis.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven't,</q> said
the young man, somewhat taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know Sabaneyev?</q> Kolya went on even more emphatically
and even more severely.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Sabaneyev? No, I don't know him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well then you can go to the devil,</q> said Kolya, cutting short the
conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on
his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who
did not even know Sabaneyev.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?</q> the young man recovered from
his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before. <q>What
did he say?</q> He turned to the market women with a silly stare.
</p>

<p>
The women laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can never tell what he's after,</q> said one of them.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Sabaneyev is it he's talking about?</q> the young man repeated,
still furious and brandishing his right arm.
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that's
who it must be,</q> one of the women suggested.
</p>

<p>
The young man stared at her wildly.
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Kuzmitchovs?</q> repeated another woman. <q>But his
name wasn't Trifon. His name's Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy
said Trifon Nikititch, so it can't be the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it's Tchizhov,</q> put
in suddenly a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening
gravely. <q>Alexey Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.</q>
</p>

<pb n='596'/><anchor id='Pg596'/>

<p>
<q>Not a doubt about it, it's Tchizhov,</q> a fourth woman emphatically
confirmed the statement.
</p>

<p>
The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.
</p>

<p>
<q>But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?</q>
he cried almost in desperation. <q><q>Do you know Sabaneyev?</q> says
he. And who the devil's to know who is Sabaneyev?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a senseless fellow. I tell you it's not Sabaneyev, but
Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that's who it is!</q> one of the
women shouted at him impressively.
</p>

<p>
<q>What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the
summer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I tell what he's to do with you?</q> put in another. <q>You
ought to know yourself what you want with him, if you make such
a clamor about him. He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you
stupid. Don't you really know him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Know whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tchizhov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I'll give him a hiding,
that I will. He was laughing at me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one.
You are a fool, that's what you are!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman.
I'll give the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing
at me!</q>
</p>

<p>
The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off,
marching along with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him,
looking round at the shouting group far behind. He too was in
high spirits, though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape
in Kolya's company.
