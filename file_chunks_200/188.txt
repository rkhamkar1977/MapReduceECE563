</p>

<p>
<q>What Sabaneyev did you mean?</q> he asked Kolya, foreseeing
what his answer would be.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do I know? Now there'll be a hubbub among them all
day. I like to stir up fools in every class of society. There's another
blockhead, that peasant there. You know, they say <q>there's no one
stupider than a stupid Frenchman,</q> but a stupid Russian shows it in
<pb n='597'/><anchor id='Pg597'/>
his face just as much. Can't you see it all over his face that he is a
fool, that peasant, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him alone, Kolya. Let's go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning,
peasant!</q>
</p>

<p>
A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled
beard, who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy.
He seemed not quite sober.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,</q> he said deliberately
in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>And if I am?</q> laughed Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, a joke's a joke. Laugh away. I don't mind. There's no
harm in a joke.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, God forgive you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you forgive me, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I quite forgive you. Go along.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say, you seem a clever peasant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cleverer than you,</q> the peasant answered unexpectedly, with
the same gravity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I doubt it,</q> said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's true, though.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is, brother.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, peasant!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There are all sorts of peasants,</q> Kolya observed to Smurov after
a brief silence. <q>How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am
always ready to recognize intelligence in the peasantry.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The
boys made haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov's lodging,
a considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty
paces from the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on
ahead and ask Karamazov to come out to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>One must sniff round a bit first,</q> he observed to Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why ask him to come out?</q> Smurov protested. <q>You go in;
they will be awfully glad to see you. What's the sense of making
friends in the frost out here?</q>
</p>

<pb n='598'/><anchor id='Pg598'/>

<p>
<q>I know why I want to see him out here in the frost,</q> Kolya cut
him short in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with <q>small
boys,</q> and Smurov ran to do his bidding.

<head>Chapter IV. The Lost Dog</head>

<p>
Kolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting
for Alyosha to appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet
him. He had heard a great deal about him from the boys, but
hitherto he had always maintained an appearance of disdainful indifference
when he was mentioned, and he had even <q>criticized</q> what
he heard about Alyosha. But secretly he had a great longing to make
his acquaintance; there was something sympathetic and attractive in
all he was told about Alyosha. So the present moment was important:
to begin with, he had to show himself at his best, to show his
independence, <q>Or he'll think of me as thirteen and take me for
a boy, like the rest of them. And what are these boys to him? I
shall ask him when I get to know him. It's a pity I am so short,
though. Tuzikov is younger than I am, yet he is half a head taller.
But I have a clever face. I am not good-looking. I know I'm
hideous, but I've a clever face. I mustn't talk too freely; if I fall
into his arms all at once, he may think&mdash;Tfoo! how horrible if he
should think&mdash;!</q>
</p>

<p>
Such were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing
his utmost to assume the most independent air. What distressed him
most was his being so short; he did not mind so much his <q>hideous</q>
face, as being so short. On the wall in a corner at home he had
the year before made a pencil-mark to show his height, and every
two months since he anxiously measured himself against it to see
how much he had gained. But alas! he grew very slowly, and this
sometimes reduced him almost to despair. His face was in reality
by no means <q>hideous</q>; on the contrary, it was rather attractive,
with a fair, pale skin, freckled. His small, lively gray eyes had a
fearless look, and often glowed with feeling. He had rather high
cheekbones; small, very red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was
<pb n='599'/><anchor id='Pg599'/>
small and unmistakably turned up. <q>I've a regular pug nose, a
regular pug nose,</q> Kolya used to mutter to himself when he looked
in the looking-glass, and he always left it with indignation. <q>But
perhaps I haven't got a clever face?</q> he sometimes thought, doubtful
even of that. But it must not be supposed that his mind was
preoccupied with his face and his height. On the contrary, however
bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him, he
quickly forgot them, and forgot them for a long time, <q>abandoning
himself entirely to ideas and to real life,</q> as he formulated it to
himself.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he
reached him, Kolya could see that he looked delighted. <q>Can he be
so glad to see me?</q> Kolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note
here, in passing, that Alyosha's appearance had undergone a complete
change since we saw him last. He had abandoned his cassock
and was wearing now a well-cut coat, a soft, round hat, and his
hair had been cropped short. All this was very becoming to him,
and he looked quite handsome. His charming face always had a
good-humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in
his good-humor. To Kolya's surprise, Alyosha came out to him just
as he was, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste.
He held out his hand to Kolya at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here you are at last! How anxious we've been to see you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway,
I am glad to make your acquaintance. I've long been hoping for
an opportunity, and have heard a great deal about you,</q> Kolya muttered,
a little breathless.
</p>

<p>
<q>We should have met anyway. I've heard a great deal about you,
too; but you've been a long time coming here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me, how are things going?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,</q>
cried Kolya warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep,
in delirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very
dear to him ... before the incident ... with the knife....
Then there's another reason.... Tell me, is that your dog?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Perezvon.</q>
</p>

<pb n='600'/><anchor id='Pg600'/>

<p>
<q>Not Zhutchka?</q> Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of
pity. <q>Is she lost for ever?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I've heard all
about it.</q> Kolya smiled mysteriously. <q>Listen, Karamazov, I'll tell
you all about it. That's what I came for; that's what I asked you
to come out here for, to explain the whole episode to you before we
go in,</q> he began with animation. <q>You see, Karamazov, Ilusha
came into the preparatory class last spring. Well, you know what
our preparatory class is&mdash;a lot of small boys. They began teasing
Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and, of course, I only
look on at them from a distance. I saw the boy was weak and small,
but he wouldn't give in to them; he fought with them. I saw he
was proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I like children like that.
And they teased him all the more. The worst of it was he was
horribly dressed at the time, his breeches were too small for him,
and there were holes in his boots. They worried him about it; they
jeered at him. That I can't stand. I stood up for him at once, and
gave it to them hot. I beat them, but they adore me, do you know,
Karamazov?</q> Kolya boasted impulsively; <q>but I am always fond of
children. I've two chickens in my hands at home now&mdash;that's
what detained me to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I took
him under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that,
the boy was proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to
me: he did my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God,
tried to copy me. In the intervals between the classes he used to
run to me at once, and I'd go about with him. On Sundays, too.
They always laugh when an older boy makes friends with a younger
one like that; but that's a prejudice. If it's my fancy, that's
enough. I am teaching him, developing him. Why shouldn't I
develop him if I like him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken up
with all these nestlings. I see you want to influence the younger
generation&mdash;to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you
this trait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me
more than anything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed
that there was a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over
the boy, and you know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish
sentimentality, and I have had it from a baby. There were contradictions
in him, too: he was proud, but he was slavishly devoted
<pb n='601'/><anchor id='Pg601'/>
to me, and yet all at once his eyes would flash and he'd refuse to
agree with me; he'd argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes to
propound certain ideas; I could see that it was not so much that he
disagreed with the ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against
me, because I was cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in
order to train him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became.
I did it on purpose: that was my idea. My object was to
form his character, to lick him into shape, to make a man of him ...
and besides ... no doubt, you understand me at a word.
Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession he was downcast
and dejected, not because of my coldness, but for something else,
something more important. I wondered what the tragedy was. I
have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to know
Smerdyakov, who was footman to your late father&mdash;it was before
his death, of course&mdash;and he taught the little fool a silly trick&mdash;that
is, a brutal, nasty trick. He told him to take a piece of bread,
to stick a pin in it, and throw it to one of those hungry dogs who
snap up anything without biting it, and then to watch and see what
would happen. So they prepared a piece of bread like that and
threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there's been such a fuss
about. The people of the house it belonged to never fed it at all,
though it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid barking, Karamazov?
I can't stand it.) So it rushed at the bread, swallowed
it, and began to squeal; it turned round and round and ran away,
squealing as it ran out of sight. That was Ilusha's own account
of it. He confessed it to me, and cried bitterly. He hugged me,
shaking all over. He kept on repeating <q>He ran away squealing</q>:
the sight of that haunted him. He was tormented by remorse, I
could see that. I took it seriously. I determined to give him a
lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I wasn't quite
straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than
I was. <q>You've done a nasty thing,</q> I said, <q>you are a scoundrel. I
won't tell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing more to do with
you for a time. I'll think it over and let you know through Smurov</q>&mdash;that's
the boy who's just come with me; he's always ready to do
anything for me&mdash;<q>whether I will have anything to do with you in
the future or whether I give you up for good as a scoundrel.</q> He
was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I'd gone too far as I
<pb n='602'/><anchor id='Pg602'/>
spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what I thought best at
the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell him that I
would not speak to him again. That's what we call it when two
schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another.
Secretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few days
and then, if I saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to him
again. That was my intention. But what do you think happened?
He heard Smurov's message, his eyes flashed. <q>Tell Krassotkin from
me,</q> he cried, <q>that I will throw bread with pins to all the dogs&mdash;all&mdash;all
of them!</q> <q>So he's going in for a little temper. We must
smoke it out of him.</q> And I began to treat him with contempt;
whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically. And just
then that affair with his father happened. You remember? You
must realize that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened
already. The boys, seeing I'd given him up, set on him and
taunted him, shouting, <q>Wisp of tow, wisp of tow!</q> And he had
soon regular skirmishes with them, which I am very sorry for.
They seem to have given him one very bad beating. One day he
flew at them all as they were coming out of school. I stood a few
yards off, looking on. And, I swear, I don't remember that I
laughed; it was quite the other way, I felt awfully sorry for him,
in another minute I would have run up to take his part. But he
suddenly met my eyes. I don't know what he fancied; but he
pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, and struck at my thigh, here
in my right leg. I didn't move. I don't mind owning I am plucky
sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at him contemptuously,
as though to say, <q>This is how you repay all my kindness! Do it
again, if you like, I'm at your service.</q> But he didn't stab me
again; he broke down, he was frightened at what he had done, he
threw away the knife, burst out crying, and ran away. I did not
sneak on him, of course, and I made them all keep quiet, so it
shouldn't come to the ears of the masters. I didn't even tell my
mother till it had healed up. And the wound was a mere scratch.
And then I heard that the same day he'd been throwing stones and
had bitten your finger&mdash;but you understand now what a state he
was in! Well, it can't be helped: it was stupid of me not to come
and forgive him&mdash;that is, to make it up with him&mdash;when he was
taken ill. I am sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So
<pb n='603'/><anchor id='Pg603'/>
now I've told you all about it ... but I'm afraid it was stupid
of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, what a pity,</q> exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, <q>that I
didn't know before what terms you were on with him, or I'd have
come to you long ago to beg you to go to him with me. Would
you believe it, when he was feverish he talked about you in
delirium. I didn't know how much you were to him! And you've
really not succeeded in finding that dog? His father and the boys
have been hunting all over the town for it. Would you believe it,
since he's been ill, I've three times heard him repeat with tears, <q>It's
because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now. God is punishing
me for it.</q> He can't get that idea out of his head. And if
the dog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost fancy
the joy would cure him. We have all rested our hopes on you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find
him?</q> Kolya asked, with great curiosity. <q>Why did you reckon
on me rather than any one else?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that
you would bring it when you'd found it. Smurov said something
of the sort. We've all been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog
is alive, that it's been seen. The boys brought him a live hare; he
just looked at it, with a faint smile, and asked them to set it free in
the fields. And so we did. His father has just this moment come
back, bringing him a mastiff pup, hoping to comfort him with that;
but I think it only makes it worse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know
him, but what do you make of him&mdash;a mountebank, a buffoon?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow
crushed. Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against
those to whom they daren't speak the truth, from having been for
years humiliated and intimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin,
that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme. His
whole life now is centered in Ilusha, and if Ilusha dies, he will either
go mad with grief or kill himself. I feel almost certain of that when
I look at him now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human
nature,</q> Kolya added, with feeling.
</p>

<pb n='604'/><anchor id='Pg604'/>

<p>
<q>And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka
you were bringing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is
Perezvon. I'll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha
more than the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know
something in a minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!</q> Kolya
cried suddenly. <q>You've no overcoat on in this bitter cold. You
see what an egoist I am. Oh, we are all egoists, Karamazov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't trouble; it is cold, but I don't often catch cold. Let us
go in, though, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are
called Kolya, but what else?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nikolay&mdash;Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in
official documents, <q>Krassotkin son.</q></q> Kolya laughed for some reason,
but added suddenly, <q>Of course I hate my name Nikolay.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's so trivial, so ordinary.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are thirteen?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, fourteen&mdash;that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight.
I'll confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you,
since it's our first meeting, so that you may understand my character
at once. I hate being asked my age, more than that ... and
in fact ... there's a libelous story going about me, that last week
I played robbers with the preparatory boys. It's a fact that I did
play with them, but it's a perfect libel to say I did it for my own
amusement. I have reasons for believing that you've heard the
story; but I wasn't playing for my own amusement, it was for the
sake of the children, because they couldn't think of anything to
do by themselves. But they've always got some silly tale. This
is an awful town for gossip, I can tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what if you had been playing for your own amusement,
what's the harm?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don't play horses,
do you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you must look at it like this,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
<q>Grown-up people go to the theater and there the adventures of all
sorts of heroes are represented&mdash;sometimes there are robbers and
battles, too&mdash;and isn't that just the same thing, in a different form,
of course? And young people's games of soldiers or robbers in their
<pb n='605'/><anchor id='Pg605'/>
playtime are also art in its first stage. You know, they spring from
the growing artistic instincts of the young. And sometimes these
games are much better than performances in the theater, the only
difference is that people go there to look at the actors, while in
these games the young people are the actors themselves. But that's
only natural.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You think so? Is that your idea?</q> Kolya looked at him intently.
<q>Oh, you know, that's rather an interesting view. When I go home,
I'll think it over. I'll admit I thought I might learn something
from you. I've come to learn of you, Karamazov,</q> Kolya concluded,
in a voice full of spontaneous feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I of you,</q> said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.
</p>

<p>
Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most
was that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to
him just as if he were <q>quite grown up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll show you something directly, Karamazov; it's a theatrical
performance, too,</q> he said, laughing nervously. <q>That's why I've
come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the
boys leave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I'm only coming in for a minute. I'll keep on my overcoat.
Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead. <hi rend='italic'>Ici</hi>,
Perezvon, lie down and be dead! You see how he's dead. I'll go
in first and explore, then I'll whistle to him when I think fit, and
you'll see, he'll dash in like mad. Only Smurov must not forget to
open the door at the moment. I'll arrange it all and you'll see
something.</q>

<head>Chapter V. By Ilusha's Bedside</head>

<p>
The room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov
is already familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded
at that moment with a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting
with Ilusha, and though all of them, like Smurov, were prepared
to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and reconciled
them with Ilusha, it was really the fact. All the art he had
<pb n='606'/><anchor id='Pg606'/>
used had been to take them, one by one, to Ilusha, without <q>sheepish
sentimentality,</q> appearing to do so casually and without design.
It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering. He was
greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy
shown him by these boys, who had been his enemies. Krassotkin
was the only one missing and his absence was a heavy load on
Ilusha's heart. Perhaps the bitterest of all his bitter memories was
his stabbing Krassotkin, who had been his one friend and protector.
Clever little Smurov, who was the first to make it up with Ilusha,
thought it was so. But when Smurov hinted to Krassotkin that
Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something, the latter cut
him short, bidding Smurov tell <q>Karamazov</q> at once that he knew
best what to do, that he wanted no one's advice, and that, if he went
to see Ilusha, he would choose his own time for he had <q>his own
reasons.</q>
</p>

<p>
That was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha
had not been to see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited,
he sent Smurov to him twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him
with a curt, impatient refusal, sending Alyosha a message not to
bother him any more, that if he came himself, he, Krassotkin, would
not go to Ilusha at all. Up to the very last day, Smurov did not
know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that morning, and only the
evening before, as he parted from Smurov, Kolya abruptly told him
to wait at home for him next morning, for he would go with him
to the Snegiryovs', but warned him on no account to say he was
coming, as he wanted to drop in casually. Smurov obeyed. Smurov's
fancy that Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the
words Kolya had dropped that <q>they must be asses not to find the
dog, if it was alive.</q> When Smurov, waiting for an opportunity,
timidly hinted at his guess about the dog, Krassotkin flew into a
violent rage. <q>I'm not such an ass as to go hunting about the town
for other people's dogs when I've got a dog of my own! And how
can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a pin?
Sheepish sentimentality, that's what it is!</q>
</p>

<p>
For the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under
the ikons in the corner. He had not been to school since the day
he met Alyosha and bit his finger. He was taken ill the same day,
though for a month afterwards he was sometimes able to get up
<pb n='607'/><anchor id='Pg607'/>
and walk about the room and passage. But latterly he had become
so weak that he could not move without help from his father. His
father was terribly concerned about him. He even gave up drinking
and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die. And
often, especially after leading him round the room on his arm and
putting him back to bed, he would run to a dark corner in the
passage and, leaning his head against the wall, he would break into
paroxysms of violent weeping, stifling his sobs that they might not
be heard by Ilusha.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the room, he would usually begin doing something
to amuse and comfort his precious boy; he would tell him stories,
funny anecdotes, or would mimic comic people he had happened
to meet, even imitate the howls and cries of animals. But Ilusha
could not bear to see his father fooling and playing the buffoon.
Though the boy tried not to show how he disliked it, he saw with
an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt, and he
was continually haunted by the memory of the <q>wisp of tow</q> and
that <q>terrible day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nina, Ilusha's gentle, crippled sister, did not like her father's
buffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time past to
Petersburg to study at the university). But the half-imbecile
mother was greatly diverted and laughed heartily when her husband
began capering about or performing something. It was the only
way she could be amused; all the rest of the time she was grumbling
and complaining that now every one had forgotten her, that no one
treated her with respect, that she was slighted, and so on. But during
the last few days she had completely changed. She began looking
constantly at Ilusha's bed in the corner and seemed lost in
thought. She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried, she cried
quietly so as not to be heard. The captain noticed the change in her
with mournful perplexity. The boys' visits at first only angered her,
but later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her, and
at last she liked them so much that, if the boys had given up coming,
she would have felt dreary without them. When the children
told some story or played a game, she laughed and clapped her hands.
She called some of them to her and kissed them. She was particularly
fond of Smurov.
</p>

<p>
As for the captain, the presence in his room of the children, who
<pb n='608'/><anchor id='Pg608'/>
came to cheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with ecstatic
joy. He even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression,
and that that would hasten his recovery. In spite of his alarm about
Ilusha, he had not, till lately, felt one minute's doubt of his boy's
ultimate recovery.
</p>

<p>
He met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand
and foot; he was ready to be their horse and even began letting them
ride on his back, but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given
up. He began buying little things for them, gingerbread and nuts,
gave them tea and cut them sandwiches. It must be noted that all
this time he had plenty of money. He had taken the two hundred
roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha had predicted he
would. And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning more about
their circumstances and Ilusha's illness, visited them herself, made
the acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating the
half-imbecile mother. Since then she had been lavish in helping
them, and the captain, terror-stricken at the thought that his boy
might be dying, forgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance.
</p>

<p>
All this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina
Ivanovna, came punctually every other day, but little was gained
by his visits and he dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday
morning a new doctor was expected, who had come from Moscow,
where he had a great reputation. Katerina Ivanovna had sent
for him from Moscow at great expense, not expressly for Ilusha, but
for another object of which more will be said in its place hereafter.
But, as he had come, she had asked him to see Ilusha as well, and the
captain had been told to expect him. He hadn't the slightest idea
that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he had long wished for
a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.
</p>

<p>
At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into
the room, the captain and all the boys were round Ilusha's bed,
looking at a tiny mastiff pup, which had only been born the day
before, though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort
and amuse Ilusha, who was still fretting over the lost and probably
dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heard three days before that he
was to be presented with a puppy, not an ordinary puppy, but a
pedigree mastiff (a very important point, of course), tried from
delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased. But his father
<pb n='609'/><anchor id='Pg609'/>
and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only served to
recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had
killed. The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he, smiling
sadly, stroked it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly he liked
the puppy, but ... it wasn't Zhutchka; if he could have had
Zhutchka and the puppy, too, then he would have been completely
happy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Krassotkin!</q> cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first
to see him come in.
</p>

<p>
Krassotkin's entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved
away and stood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full
view of Ilusha. The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Please come in ... you are welcome!</q> he said hurriedly. <q>Ilusha,
Mr. Krassotkin has come to see you!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly
showed his complete knowledge of the manners of good society. He
turned first to the captain's wife sitting in her arm-chair, who was
very ill-humored at the moment, and was grumbling that the boys
stood between her and Ilusha's bed and did not let her see the new
puppy. With the greatest courtesy he made her a bow, scraping
his foot, and turning to Nina, he made her, as the only other lady
present, a similar bow. This polite behavior made an extremely
favorable impression on the deranged lady.
</p>

<p>
<q>There, you can see at once he is a young man that has been
well brought up,</q> she commented aloud, throwing up her hands;
<q>but as for our other visitors they come in one on the top of
another.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is
that?</q> muttered the captain affectionately, though a little anxious
on her account.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's how they ride in. They get on each other's shoulders in
the passage and prance in like that on a respectable family. Strange
sort of visitors!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But who's come in like that, mamma?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that boy came in riding on that one's back and this one
on that one's.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya was already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick boy turned visibly
paler. He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at
<pb n='610'/><anchor id='Pg610'/>
Kolya. Kolya had not seen his little friend for two months, and he
was overwhelmed at the sight of him. He had never imagined
that he would see such a wasted, yellow face, such enormous, feverishly
glowing eyes and such thin little hands. He saw, with grieved
surprise, Ilusha's rapid, hard breathing and dry lips. He stepped
close to him, held out his hand, and almost overwhelmed, he said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, old man ... how are you?</q> But his voice failed him,
he couldn't achieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched
and the corners of his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful little
smile, still unable to utter a word. Something moved Kolya to
raise his hand and pass it over Ilusha's hair.
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind!</q> he murmured softly to him to cheer him up,
or perhaps not knowing why he said it. For a minute they were
silent again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hallo, so you've got a new puppy?</q> Kolya said suddenly, in a
most callous voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye&mdash;es,</q> answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.
</p>

<p>
<q>A black nose, that means he'll be fierce, a good house-dog,</q>
Kolya observed gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared
about was the puppy and its black nose. But in reality he still
had to do his utmost to control his feelings not to burst out crying
like a child, and do what he would he could not control it. <q>When
it grows up, you'll have to keep it on the chain, I'm sure.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He'll be a huge dog!</q> cried one of the boys.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course he will,</q> <q>a mastiff,</q> <q>large,</q> <q>like this,</q> <q>as big as
a calf,</q> shouted several voices.
</p>

<p>
<q>As big as a calf, as a real calf,</q> chimed in the captain. <q>I got
one like that on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his parents
are huge and very fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor....
Sit down here, on Ilusha's bed, or here on the bench. You are
welcome, we've been hoping to see you a long time.... You were
so kind as to come with Alexey Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha's feet. Though
he had perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation
on his way, now he completely lost the thread of it.
</p>

<p>
<q>No ... I came with Perezvon. I've got a dog now, called
Perezvon. A Slavonic name. He's out there ... if I whistle, he'll
run in. I've brought a dog, too,</q> he said, addressing Ilusha all at
<pb n='611'/><anchor id='Pg611'/>
once. <q>Do you remember Zhutchka, old man?</q> he suddenly fired
the question at him.
</p>

<p>
Ilusha's little face quivered. He looked with an agonized expression
at Kolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed
to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not
notice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where ... is Zhutchka?</q> Ilusha asked in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka's lost and done for!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ilusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on
Kolya. Alyosha, catching Kolya's eye, signed to him vigorously
again, but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed.
</p>

<p>
<q>It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died
after a meal like that,</q> Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he
seemed a little breathless. <q>But I've got a dog, Perezvon ... A
Slavonic name.... I've brought him to show you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want him!</q> said Ilusha suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I
brought him on purpose.... He's the same sort of shaggy dog....
You allow me to call in my dog, madam?</q> He suddenly addressed
Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicable excitement in his
manner.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want him, I don't want him!</q> cried Ilusha, with a
mournful break in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better,</q> the captain started up from the chest by the
wall on which he had just sat down, <q>you'd better ... another
time,</q> he muttered, but Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly
shouted to Smurov, <q>Open the door,</q> and as soon as it was open,
he blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed headlong into the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!</q> shouted Kolya, jumping up, and
the dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha's bedside. What followed
was a surprise to every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently
forward, bent over Perezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's ... Zhutchka!</q> he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking
with joy and suffering.
</p>

<p>
<q>And who did you think it was?</q> Krassotkin shouted with all
his might, in a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the
dog and lifted him up to Ilusha.
</p>

<pb n='612'/><anchor id='Pg612'/>

<p>
<q>Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn,
just the marks you described to me. It was by that I found him. I
found him directly. He did not belong to any one!</q> he explained,
turning quickly to the captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then
again to Ilusha. <q>He used to live in the Fedotovs' back-yard.
Though he made his home there, they did not feed him. He was a
stray dog that had run away from the village ... I found him....
You see, old man, he couldn't have swallowed what you gave
him. If he had, he must have died, he must have! So he must have
spat it out, since he is alive. You did not see him do it. But the
pin pricked his tongue, that is why he squealed. He ran away
squealing and you thought he'd swallowed it. He might well
squeal, because the skin of dogs' mouths is so tender ... tenderer
than in men, much tenderer!</q> Kolya cried impetuously, his face
glowing and radiant with delight. Ilusha could not speak. White
as a sheet, he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya, with his great eyes
almost starting out of his head. And if Krassotkin, who had no
suspicion of it, had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such
a moment might have on the sick child's health, nothing would have
induced him to play such a trick on him. But Alyosha was perhaps
the only person in the room who realized it. As for the captain
he behaved like a small child.
</p>

<p>
<q>Zhutchka! It's Zhutchka!</q> he cried in a blissful voice, <q>Ilusha,
this is Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!</q>
He was almost weeping.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I never guessed!</q> cried Smurov regretfully. <q>Bravo, Krassotkin!
I said he'd find the dog and here he's found him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here he's found him!</q> another boy repeated gleefully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Krassotkin's a brick!</q> cried a third voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a brick, he's a brick!</q> cried the other boys, and they began
clapping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait, wait,</q> Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all.
<q>I'll tell you how it happened, that's the whole point. I found him,
I took him home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at
home and did not show him to any one till to-day. Only Smurov
has known for the last fortnight, but I assured him this dog was
called Perezvon and he did not guess. And meanwhile I taught the
dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see all the things he can do!
<pb n='613'/><anchor id='Pg613'/>
I trained him so as to bring you a well-trained dog, in good condition,
old man, so as to be able to say to you, <q>See, old man, what a
fine dog your Zhutchka is now!</q> Haven't you a bit of meat? He'll
show you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of
meat, haven't you got any?</q>
</p>

<p>
The captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their
cooking was done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate
haste, shouted to Perezvon, <q>Dead!</q> And the dog immediately
turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air.
The boys laughed. Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile,
but the person most delighted with the dog's performance was
<q>mamma.</q> She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers
and calling it, <q>Perezvon, Perezvon!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing will make him get up, nothing!</q> Kolya cried triumphantly,
proud of his success. <q>He won't move for all the shouting
in the world, but if I call to him, he'll jump up in a minute. Ici,
Perezvon!</q> The dog leapt up and bounded about, whining with
delight. The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it hot?</q> Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air,
taking the meat. <q>Dogs don't like hot things. No, it's all right.
Look, everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren't you looking?
He does not look at him, now I've brought him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless
with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his
nose. The luckless dog had to stand without moving, with the
meat on his nose, as long as his master chose to keep him, without a
movement, perhaps for half an hour. But he kept Perezvon only
for a brief moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Paid for!</q> cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the
dog's nose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm
and surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train
the dog?</q> exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach
in his voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Simply for that!</q> answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. <q>I
wanted to show him in all his glory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perezvon! Perezvon,</q> called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin
fingers and beckoning to the dog.
</p>

<pb n='614'/><anchor id='Pg614'/>

<p>
<q>What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! <hi rend='italic'>Ici</hi>, Perezvon!</q>
Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy
threw both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his
cheek. Ilusha crept close to him, stretched himself out in bed and
hid his face in the dog's shaggy coat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear, dear!</q> kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again
on the edge of the bed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I've brought you a little
cannon. You remember, I told you about it before and you said
how much you'd like to see it. Well, here, I've brought it to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze
cannon. He hurried, because he was happy himself. Another time
he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed
off, now he hurried on regardless of all consideration. <q>You are all
happy now,</q> he felt, <q>so here's something to make you happier!</q>
He was perfectly enchanted himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been coveting this thing for a long while; it's for you, old
man, it's for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him, he
had it from his brother. I swopped a book from father's book-case
for it, <hi rend='italic'>A Kinsman of Mahomet or Salutary Folly</hi>, a scandalous book
published in Moscow a hundred years ago, before they had any
censorship. And Morozov has a taste for such things. He was
grateful to me, too....</q>
</p>

<p>
Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and
admire it. Ilusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still round
the dog, he gazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was even
greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too, and
that it could be fired off at once <q>if it won't alarm the ladies.</q>
<q>Mamma</q> immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request
was granted. She was much pleased with the little bronze
cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap. She
readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired, without any idea
of what she had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the
shot. The captain, as a military man, undertook to load it, putting
in a minute quantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be
put off till another time. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming
towards an empty part of the room, three grains of powder were
thrust into the touch-hole and a match was put to it. A magnificent
<pb n='615'/><anchor id='Pg615'/>
explosion followed. Mamma was startled, but at once laughed
with delight. The boys gazed in speechless triumph. But the captain,
looking at Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them.
Kolya picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha,
together with the powder and the shot.
</p>

<p>
<q>I got it for you, for you! I've been keeping it for you a long
time,</q> he repeated once more in his delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!</q> mamma began
begging like a little child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she
would not get it. Kolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted
uneasily.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, mamma,</q> he ran to her, <q>the cannon's yours, of course,
but let Ilusha have it, because it's a present to him, but it's just
as good as yours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall
belong to both of you, both of you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mine
altogether, not Ilusha's,</q> persisted mamma, on the point of tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it, mother, here, keep it!</q> Ilusha cried. <q>Krassotkin,
may I give it to my mother?</q> he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring
face, as though he were afraid he might be offended at his
giving his present to some one else.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course you may,</q> Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking
the cannon from Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a
polite bow. She was so touched that she cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha, darling, he's the one who loves his mamma!</q> she said
tenderly, and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her
lap again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, let me kiss your hand.</q> The captain darted up to her
at once and did so.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,</q> said
the grateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I'll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We
make the powder ourselves now. Borovikov found out how it's
made&mdash;twenty-four parts of saltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of
birchwood charcoal. It's all pounded together, mixed into a paste
with water and rubbed through a tammy sieve&mdash;that's how it's
done.</q>
</p>

<pb n='616'/><anchor id='Pg616'/>

<p>
<q>Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it's not real
gunpowder,</q> responded Ilusha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not real?</q> Kolya flushed. <q>It burns. I don't know, of
course.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't mean that,</q> put in the captain with a guilty face.
<q>I only said that real powder is not made like that, but that's
nothing, it can be made so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum
pot, it burned splendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash.
But that was only the paste, and if you rub it through ... but of
course you know best, I don't know.... And Bulkin's father
thrashed him on account of our powder, did you hear?</q> he turned
to Ilusha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> answered Ilusha. He listened to Kolya with immense
interest and enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
<q>We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it
under his bed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and
thrashed him on the spot. He was going to make a complaint
against me to the masters. He is not allowed to go about with me
now, no one is allowed to go about with me now. Smurov is not
allowed to either, I've got a bad name with every one. They say I'm
a <q>desperate character,</q></q> Kolya smiled scornfully. <q>It all began
from what happened on the railway.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, we've heard of that exploit of yours, too,</q> cried the captain.
<q>How could you lie still on the line? Is it possible you weren't
the least afraid, lying there under the train? Weren't you frightened?</q>
</p>

<p>
The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>N&mdash;not particularly,</q> answered Kolya carelessly. <q>What's
blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed
goose,</q> he said, turning again to Ilusha. But though he assumed an
unconcerned air as he talked, he still could not control himself and
was continually missing the note he tried to keep up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! I heard about the goose!</q> Ilusha laughed, beaming all over.
<q>They told me, but I didn't understand. Did they really take you
to the court?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill
as they always do,</q> Kolya began carelessly. <q>I was walking
<pb n='617'/><anchor id='Pg617'/>
through the market-place here one day, just when they'd driven in
the geese. I stopped and looked at them. All at once a fellow,
who is an errand-boy at Plotnikov's now, looked at me and said,
<q>What are you looking at the geese for?</q> I looked at him; he was
a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I am always on the side
of the peasantry, you know. I like talking to the peasants....
We've dropped behind the peasants&mdash;that's an axiom. I believe
you are laughing, Karamazov?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Heaven forbid, I am listening,</q> said Alyosha with a most
good-natured air, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.
</p>

<p>
<q>My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,</q> he hurried on again,
looking pleased. <q>I believe in the people and am always glad to give
them their due, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a <foreign rend='italic'>sine
qua non</foreign> ... But I was telling you about the goose. So I turned to
the fool and answered, <q>I am wondering what the goose thinks
about.</q> He looked at me quite stupidly, <q>And what does the goose
think about?</q> he asked. <q>Do you see that cart full of oats?</q> I said.
<q>The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the goose has put its
neck right under the wheel to gobble them up&mdash;do you see?</q> <q>I see
that quite well,</q> he said. <q>Well,</q> said I, <q>if that cart were to move
on a little, would it break the goose's neck or not?</q> <q>It'd be sure
to break it,</q> and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted.
<q>Come on, then,</q> said I, <q>let's try.</q> <q>Let's,</q> he said. And it did not
take us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle without being noticed,
and I stood on one side to direct the goose. And the owner wasn't
looking, he was talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the
goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself, under the cart, just
under the wheel. I winked at the lad, he tugged at the bridle, and
crack. The goose's neck was broken in half. And, as luck would
have it, all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up
a shindy at once. <q>You did that on purpose!</q> <q>No, not on purpose.</q>
<q>Yes, you did, on purpose!</q> Well, they shouted, <q>Take him
to the justice of the peace!</q> They took me, too. <q>You were there,
too,</q> they said, <q>you helped, you're known all over the market!</q>
And, for some reason, I really am known all over the market,</q> Kolya
added conceitedly. <q rend='pre'>We all went off to the justice's, they brought
the goose, too. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply
blubbering like a woman. And the farmer kept shouting that you
<pb n='618'/><anchor id='Pg618'/>
could kill any number of geese like that. Well, of course, there
were witnesses. The justice of the peace settled it in a minute, that
the farmer was to be paid a rouble for the goose, and the fellow to
have the goose. And he was warned not to play such pranks again.
And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman. <q>It wasn't me,</q> he
said, <q>it was he egged me on,</q> and he pointed to me. I answered
with the utmost composure that I hadn't egged him on, that I simply
stated the general proposition, had spoken hypothetically. The
justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for
having smiled. <q>I'll complain to your masters of you, so that for
the future you mayn't waste your time on such general propositions,
instead of sitting at your books and learning your lessons.</q> He didn't
complain to the masters, that was a joke, but the matter was noised
abroad and came to the ears of the masters. Their ears are long,
you know! The classical master, Kolbasnikov, was particularly
shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me off again. But Kolbasnikov
is savage with every one now like a green ass. Did you know,
Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles, and
his bride's a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.
The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it:</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Astounding news has reached the class,</l>
<l>Kolbasnikov has been an ass.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>And so on, awfully funny, I'll bring it to you later on. I say
nothing against Dardanelov, he is a learned man, there's no doubt
about it. I respect men like that and it's not because he stood up
for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you took him down about the founders of Troy!</q> Smurov
put in suddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment.
He was particularly pleased with the story of the goose.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you really take him down?</q> the captain inquired, in a flattering
way. <q>On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it,
Ilusha told me about it at the time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!</q>
put in Ilusha; <q>he only pretends to be like that, but really he is top
in every subject....</q>
</p>

<p>
Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, that's all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider
<pb n='619'/><anchor id='Pg619'/>
this an unimportant question,</q> said Kolya with haughty humility.
He had by now completely recovered his dignity, though
he was still a little uneasy. He felt that he was greatly excited
and that he had talked about the goose, for instance, with too little
reserve, while Alyosha had looked serious and had not said a word
all the time. And the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling
fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him, and thought
he was showing off before him. If he dared to think anything like
that Kolya would&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>I regard the question as quite a trivial one,</q> he rapped out
again, proudly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I know who founded Troy,</q> a boy, who had not spoken
before, said suddenly, to the surprise of every one. He was silent
and seemed to be shy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called
Kartashov. He was sitting near the door. Kolya looked at him
with dignified amazement.
