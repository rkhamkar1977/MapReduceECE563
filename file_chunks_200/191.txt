conscience, and when he learned the whole story, he completely
changed his view of her. And strange to say, though he was
firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in prison,
the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him.
<q>He was a man of good heart, perhaps,</q> he thought, <q>who had
come to grief from drinking and dissipation.</q> His first horror had
been succeeded by pity. As for Alyosha, the police captain was
very fond of him and had known him for a long time. Rakitin,
who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner,
was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the <q>police captain's
young ladies,</q> as he called them, and was always hanging about
their house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent,
too, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his
duties, was a kind-hearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate
acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent, who
was fond of talking to him, generally on sacred subjects. He respected
Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in awe of his opinion, though
he was a great philosopher himself; <q>self-taught,</q> of course. But
<pb n='662'/><anchor id='Pg662'/>
Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him. During the last year
the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal Gospels, and
constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend. He
used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours
together with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were
late at the prison, he had only to go to the superintendent and
everything was made easy. Besides, every one in the prison, down
to the humblest warder, had grown used to Alyosha. The sentry,
of course, did not trouble him so long as the authorities were
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs,
to the place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the
room he came upon Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya.
They were both talking loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he
saw him out, while Rakitin seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like
meeting Alyosha, especially of late. He scarcely spoke to him, and
bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha enter now, he frowned and
looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his
big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at once
for his umbrella.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must mind not to forget my belongings,</q> he muttered, simply
to say something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mind you don't forget other people's belongings,</q> said Mitya, as
a joke, and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up
instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better give that advice to your own family, who've
always been a slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,</q> he cried, suddenly
trembling with anger.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter? I was joking,</q> cried Mitya. <q>Damn it all!
They are all like that,</q> he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards
Rakitin's hurriedly retreating figure. <q>He was sitting here, laughing
and cheerful, and all at once he boils up like that. He didn't
even nod to you. Have you broken with him completely? Why
are you so late? I've not been simply waiting, but thirsting for you
the whole morning. But never mind. We'll make up for it now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great
friends?</q> asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through
which Rakitin had disappeared.
</p>

<pb n='663'/><anchor id='Pg663'/>

<p>
<q>Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it
likely&mdash;a pig like that? He considers I am ... a blackguard.
They can't understand a joke either, that's the worst of such people.
They never understand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat;
they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here. But
he is a clever fellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it's all over with
me now.</q>
</p>

<p>
He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?</q>
Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you talking about?</q> said Mitya, looking at him rather
uncertainly. <q>Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now
we've been talking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but
I haven't said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial
is to-morrow; but it wasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was
all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean, Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ethics?</q> asked Alyosha, wondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; is it a science?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can't
explain to you what sort of science it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He's not
going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he'll
go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may
be of use and make his own career, too. Ough! they are first-rate,
these people, at making a career! Damn ethics, I am done for,
Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than any one. It
makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Karl Bernard?</q> Alyosha was surprised again.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What
was he? Chemist or what?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He must be a savant,</q> answered Alyosha; <q>but I confess I can't
tell you much about him, either. I've heard of him as a savant,
but what sort I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, damn him, then! I don't know either,</q> swore Mitya.
<q>A scoundrel of some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels.
And Rakitin will make his way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he
<pb n='664'/><anchor id='Pg664'/>
is another Bernard. Ugh, these Bernards! They are all over the
place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what is the matter?</q> Alyosha asked insistently.
</p>

<p>
<q>He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so
begin his literary career. That's what he comes for; he said so
himself. He wants to prove some theory. He wants to say <q>he
couldn't help murdering his father, he was corrupted by his environment,</q>
and so on. He explained it all to me. He is going to put
in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn the fellow, he can
put in a tinge if he likes, I don't care. He can't bear Ivan, he hates
him. He's not fond of you, either. But I don't turn him out, for
he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to him
just now, <q>The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers;
for all true Russians are philosophers, and though you've studied,
you are not a philosopher&mdash;you are a low fellow.</q> He laughed, so
maliciously. And I said to him, <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>De
ideabus non est disputandum</foreign>.</q>
Isn't that rather good? I can set up for being a classic, you see!</q>
Mitya laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,</q> Alyosha
interposed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is it all over with me? H'm!... The fact of it is ...
if you take it as a whole, I am sorry to lose God&mdash;that's why it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean by <q>sorry to lose God</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head&mdash;that is, these nerves
are there in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little
tails, the little tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ...
that is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and
then they begin quivering, those little tails ... and when they
quiver, then an image appears ... it doesn't appear at once, but
an instant, a second, passes ... and then something like a moment
appears; that is, not a moment&mdash;devil take the moment!&mdash;but an
image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it! That's why I see
and then think, because of those tails, not at all because I've got a
soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness. All that is nonsense!
Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother, and it
simply bowled me over. It's magnificent, Alyosha, this science! A
new man's arising&mdash;that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to
lose God!</q>
</p>

<pb n='665'/><anchor id='Pg665'/>

<p>
<q>Well, that's a good thing, anyway,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I am sorry to lose God? It's chemistry, brother, chemistry!
There's no help for it, your reverence, you must make way
for chemistry. And Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn't he
dislike Him! That's the sore point with all of them. But they
conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend. <q>Will you preach this
in your reviews?</q> I asked him. <q>Oh, well, if I did it openly, they
won't let it through,</q> he said. He laughed. <q>But what will become
of men then?</q> I asked him, <q>without God and immortal life? All
things are lawful then, they can do what they like?</q> <q>Didn't you
know?</q> he said laughing, <q>a clever man can do what he likes,</q> he
said. <q>A clever man knows his way about, but you've put your foot
in it, committing a murder, and now you are rotting in prison.</q> He
says that to my face! A regular pig! I used to kick such people
out, but now I listen to them. He talks a lot of sense, too. Writes
well. He began reading me an article last week. I copied out three
lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and
read:
</p>

<p>
<q><q>In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to
put one's personality in contradiction to one's reality.</q> Do you understand
that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't,</q> said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to
him with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand either. It's dark and obscure, but intellectual.
<q>Every one writes like that now,</q> he says, <q>it's the effect
of their environment.</q> They are afraid of the environment. He
writes poetry, too, the rascal. He's written in honor of Madame
Hohlakov's foot. Ha ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've heard about it,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you? And have you heard the poem?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I've got it. Here it is. I'll read it to you. You don't know&mdash;I
haven't told you&mdash;there's quite a story about it. He's a rascal!
Three weeks ago he began to tease me. <q>You've got yourself into a
mess, like a fool, for the sake of three thousand, but I'm going to
collar a hundred and fifty thousand. I am going to marry a widow
and buy a house in Petersburg.</q> And he told me he was courting
<pb n='666'/><anchor id='Pg666'/>
Madame Hohlakov. She hadn't much brains in her youth, and now
at forty she has lost what she had. <q>But she's awfully sentimental,</q>
he says; <q>that's how I shall get hold of her. When I marry her, I
shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.</q>
And his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow,
but for the hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe
it. He came to see me every day. <q>She is coming round,</q> he declared.
He was beaming with delight. And then, all of a sudden,
he was turned out of the house. Perhotin's carrying everything
before him, bravo! I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him
out of the house. And he had written this doggerel. <q>It's the first
time I've soiled my hands with writing poetry,</q> he said. <q>It's to
win her heart, so it's in a good cause. When I get hold of the silly
woman's fortune, I can be of great social utility.</q> They have this
social justification for every nasty thing they do! <q>Anyway it's
better than your Pushkin's poetry,</q> he said, <q>for I've managed to
advocate enlightenment even in that.</q> I understand what he means
about Pushkin, I quite see that, if he really was a man of talent
and only wrote about women's feet. But wasn't Rakitin stuck up
about his doggerel! The vanity of these fellows! <q>On the convalescence
of the swollen foot of the object of my affections</q>&mdash;he
thought of that for a title. He's a waggish fellow.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>A captivating little foot,</l>
<l>Though swollen and red and tender!</l>
<l>The doctors come and plasters put,</l>
<l>But still they cannot mend her.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet, 'tis not for her foot I dread&mdash;</l>
<l>A theme for Pushkin's muse more fit&mdash;</l>
<l>It's not her foot, it is her head:</l>
<l>I tremble for her loss of wit!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>For as her foot swells, strange to say,</l>
<l>Her intellect is on the wane&mdash;</l>
<l>Oh, for some remedy I pray</l>
<l>That may restore both foot and brain!</l>

</quote>

<p>
<q rend='post'>He is a pig, a regular pig, but he's very arch, the rascal! And he
really has put in a progressive idea. And wasn't he angry when
she kicked him out! He was gnashing his teeth!</q>
</p>

<pb n='667'/><anchor id='Pg667'/>

<p>
<q>He's taken his revenge already,</q> said Alyosha. <q>He's written
a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in <hi rend='italic'>Gossip</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's his doing, that's his doing!</q> Mitya assented, frowning.
<q>That's him! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting
things that have been written about Grushenka, for instance....
And about Katya, too.... H'm!</q>
</p>

<p>
He walked across the room with a harassed air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, I cannot stay long,</q> Alyosha said, after a pause. <q>To-morrow
will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God
will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here,
talking of I don't know what ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, don't be amazed at me,</q> Mitya broke in warmly. <q>Am I
to talk of that stinking dog? Of the murderer? We've talked
enough of him. I don't want to say more of the stinking son of
Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you will see. Hush!</q>
</p>

<p>
He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes
glowed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rakitin wouldn't understand it,</q> he began in a sort of exaltation;
<q>but you, you'll understand it all. That's why I was thirsting
for you. You see, there's so much I've been wanting to tell you
for ever so long, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven't said
a word about what matters most; the moment never seems to have
come. Now I can wait no longer. I must pour out my heart to
you. Brother, these last two months I've found in myself a new
man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me, but
would never have come to the surface, if it hadn't been for this
blow from heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend
twenty years in the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not
a bit afraid of that&mdash;it's something else I am afraid of now: that
that new man may leave me. Even there, in the mines, under-ground,
I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer
by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even there one
may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen
heart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last
bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature;
one may bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are
so many of them, hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for
<pb n='668'/><anchor id='Pg668'/>
them. Why was it I dreamed of that <q>babe</q> at such a moment?
<q>Why is the babe so poor?</q> That was a sign to me at that moment.
It's for the babe I'm going. Because we are all responsible for all.
For all the <q>babes,</q> for there are big children as well as little children.
All are <q>babes.</q> I go for all, because some one must go for all. I
didn't kill father, but I've got to go. I accept it. It's all come
to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are numbers of
them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their
hands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom,
but then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without
which man cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it's His
privilege&mdash;a grand one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer!
What should I be underground there without God? Rakitin's
laughing! If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter Him
underground. One cannot exist in prison without God; it's even
more impossible than out of prison. And then we men underground
will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to
God, with Whom is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech.
He turned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,</q> he began again.
<q>You wouldn't believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a
thirst for existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within
these peeling walls. Rakitin doesn't understand that; all he cares
about is building a house and letting flats. But I've been longing
for you. And what is suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it
were beyond reckoning. I am not afraid of it now. I was afraid of
it before. Do you know, perhaps I won't answer at the trial at all....
And I seem to have such strength in me now, that I think I
could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to
repeat to myself every moment, <q>I exist.</q> In thousands of agonies&mdash;I
exist. I'm tormented on the rack&mdash;but I exist! Though I sit
alone on a pillar&mdash;I exist! I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun,
I know it's there. And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that
the sun is there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the
death of me. Damn them! Brother Ivan&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of brother Ivan?</q> interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did
not hear.
</p>

<pb n='669'/><anchor id='Pg669'/>

<p>
<q>You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all
hidden away in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not
understand were surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight
and rage. It was to stifle them in myself, to still them, to smother
them. Ivan is not Rakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx
and is silent; he is always silent. It's God that's worrying me.
That's the only thing that's worrying me. What if He doesn't
exist? What if Rakitin's right&mdash;that it's an idea made up by men?
Then if He doesn't exist, man is the chief of the earth, of the universe.
Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good without
God? That's the question. I always come back to that. For whom
is man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To
whom will he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that
one can love humanity without God. Well, only a sniveling idiot
can maintain that. I can't understand it. Life's easy for Rakitin.
<q>You'd better think about the extension of civic rights, or even
of keeping down the price of meat. You will show your love for
humanity more simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.</q>
I answered him, <q>Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to
raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every
copeck.</q> He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness?
Answer me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another
with a Chinaman, so it's a relative thing. Or isn't it? Is it not
relative? A treacherous question! You won't laugh if I tell you it's
kept me awake two nights. I only wonder now how people can
live and think nothing about it. Vanity! Ivan has no God. He has
an idea. It's beyond me. But he is silent. I believe he is a free-mason.
I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted to drink from the
springs of his soul&mdash;he was silent. But once he did drop a word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he say?</q> Alyosha took it up quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I said to him, <q>Then everything is lawful, if it is so?</q> He
frowned. <q>Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,</q> he said, <q>was a pig, but
his ideas were right enough.</q> That was what he dropped. That
was all he said. That was going one better than Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Alyosha assented bitterly. <q>When was he with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said
nothing about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When
my business here is over and the verdict has been given, then I'll
<pb n='670'/><anchor id='Pg670'/>
tell you something. I'll tell you everything. We've something tremendous
on hand.... And you shall be my judge in it. But
don't begin about that now; be silent. You talk of to-morrow, of
the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you talked to the counsel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He's
a soft, city-bred rogue&mdash;a Bernard! But he doesn't believe me&mdash;not
a bit of it. Only imagine, he believes I did it. I see it. <q>In that
case,</q> I asked him, <q>why have you come to defend me?</q> Hang them
all! They've got a doctor down, too, want to prove I'm mad. I
won't have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to do her <q>duty</q> to the
end, whatever the strain!</q> Mitya smiled bitterly. <q>The cat! Hard-hearted
creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroe that she
was a woman of <q>great wrath.</q> They repeated it. Yes, the facts
against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory
sticks to his point. Grigory's honest, but a fool. Many people are
honest because they are fools: that's Rakitin's idea. Grigory's my
enemy. And there are some people who are better as foes than
friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna. I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she
will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand.
She'll pay it back to the last farthing. I don't want her sacrifice;
they'll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I can stand it.
Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the court, can't
you? But damn it all, it doesn't matter! I shall get through somehow.
I don't pity her. It's her own doing. She deserves what she
gets. I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.</q> He smiled bitterly
again. <q>Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why
should she have such suffering to bear?</q> he exclaimed suddenly,
with tears. <q>Grusha's killing me; the thought of her's killing me,
killing me. She was with me just now....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I
kissed her as she was going. I didn't ask her forgiveness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didn't you?</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness
for a fault from a woman you love. From one you love especially,
however greatly you may have been in fault. For a woman&mdash;devil
<pb n='671'/><anchor id='Pg671'/>
only knows what to make of a woman! I know something about
them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman.
Say, <q>I am sorry, forgive me,</q> and a shower of reproaches will follow!
Nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly, she'll
humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have never happened,
recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her own,
and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do
it. She'll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head.
They are ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all
these angels without whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and
openly, dear boy, every decent man ought to be under some woman's
thumb. That's my conviction&mdash;not conviction, but feeling. A
man ought to be magnanimous, and it's no disgrace to a man! No
disgrace to a hero, not even a Cæsar! But don't ever beg her pardon
all the same for anything. Remember that rule given you by
your brother Mitya, who's come to ruin through women. No, I'd
better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I
worship her, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn't see it. No,
she still thinks I don't love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures
me with her love. The past was nothing! In the past it was
only those infernal curves of hers that tortured me, but now I've
taken all her soul into my soul and through her I've become a man
myself. Will they marry us? If they don't, I shall die of jealousy.
I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you
about me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya
listened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then she is not angry at my being jealous?</q> he exclaimed.
<q>She is a regular woman! <q>I've a fierce heart myself!</q> Ah, I love
such fierce hearts, though I can't bear any one's being jealous of me.
I can't endure it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her
infinitely. Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry?
That's the question. And without her I can't exist....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark.
He suddenly seemed terribly worried.
</p>

<p>
<q>So there's a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot
against her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good
Grushenka, that's not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your
<pb n='672'/><anchor id='Pg672'/>
foolish feminine way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I'll tell
you our secret!</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was
standing before him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery,
though in reality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing
in the corner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers
on guard.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will tell you all our secret,</q> Mitya whispered hurriedly. <q>I
meant to tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without
you? You are everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior
to us, you are my angel. It's your decision will decide it.
Perhaps it's you that is superior and not Ivan. You see, it's a question
of conscience, question of the higher conscience&mdash;the secret is
so important that I can't settle it myself, and I've put it off till I
could speak to you. But anyway it's too early to decide now, for
we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you
shall decide my fate. Don't decide it now. I'll tell you now. You
listen, but don't decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won't tell you
everything. I'll only tell you the idea, without details, and you
keep quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But,
goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I'm afraid your eyes
will tell me your decision, even if you don't speak. Oo! I'm afraid!
Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my <emph>escaping</emph>. I won't tell you the
details: it's all been thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don't
decide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can't
live without Grusha! What if they won't let her follow me to
Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And
without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer?
I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the
other hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering.
A sign has come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I
turn my back on it. Ivan says that in America, <q>with the good-will,</q>
I can be of more use than underground. But what becomes
of our hymn from underground? What's America? America is
vanity again! And there's a lot of swindling in America, too, I
expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell you, you
know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand
this. There's no one else. It's folly, madness to others, all I've told
<pb n='673'/><anchor id='Pg673'/>
you of the hymn. They'll say I'm out of my mind or a fool. I am
not out of my mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about
the hymn, too. He understands, only he doesn't answer&mdash;he doesn't
speak. He doesn't believe in the hymn. Don't speak, don't speak.
I see how you look! You have already decided. Don't decide, spare
me! I can't live without Grusha. Wait till after the trial!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands
on his shoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his
brother's.
</p>

<p>
<q>They don't let convicts marry, do they?</q> he repeated for the
third time in a supplicating voice.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me one thing,</q> he said. <q>Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose
idea was it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn't come to see me at
first, then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it
straight away. He is awfully keen on it. He doesn't ask me, but
orders me to escape. He doesn't doubt of my obeying him, though
I showed him all my heart as I have to you, and told him about the
hymn, too. He told me he'd arrange it; he's found out about everything.
But of that later. He's simply set on it. It's all a matter
of money: he'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty
thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificent
escape for ten thousand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And he told you on no account to tell me?</q> Alyosha asked
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you.
He is afraid, no doubt, that you'll stand before me as my conscience.
Don't tell him I told you. Don't tell him, for anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right,</q> Alyosha pronounced; <q>it's impossible to decide
anything before the trial is over. After the trial you'll decide of
yourself. Then you'll find that new man in yourself and he will
decide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A new man, or a Bernard who'll decide <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à
la</foreign> Bernard, for I believe
I'm a contemptible Bernard myself,</q> said Mitya, with a bitter
grin.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head.
<pb n='674'/><anchor id='Pg674'/>
<q>Alyosha, darling, it's time you were going,</q> he said, with a sudden
haste. <q>There's the superintendent shouting in the yard. He'll
be here directly. We are late; it's irregular. Embrace me quickly.
Kiss me! Sign me with the cross, darling, for the cross I have to
bear to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
They embraced and kissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan,</q> said Mitya suddenly, <q>suggests my escaping; but, of
course, he believes I did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
A mournful smile came on to his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you asked him whether he believes it?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I haven't. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I hadn't the
courage. But I saw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going
out, when Mitya suddenly called him back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stand facing me! That's right!</q> And again he seized Alyosha,
putting both hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly
quite pale, so that it was dreadfully apparent, even through the
gathering darkness. His lips twitched, his eyes fastened upon
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do
you believe I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The
whole truth, don't lie!</q> he cried desperately.
</p>

<p>
Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something
like a stab at his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush! What do you mean?</q> he faltered helplessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>The whole truth, the whole, don't lie!</q> repeated Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!</q>
broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha's breast, and he
raised his right hand in the air, as though calling God to witness
his words.
</p>

<p>
Mitya's whole face was lighted up with bliss.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you!</q> he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh
escape him after fainting. <q>Now you have given me new life.
Would you believe it, till this moment I've been afraid to ask you,
you, even you. Well, go! You've given me strength for to-morrow.
God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!</q> was Mitya's
last word.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such
<pb n='675'/><anchor id='Pg675'/>
lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha&mdash;all this suddenly opened
before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair
in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion
overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn
heart. <q>Love Ivan!</q>&mdash;he suddenly recalled Mitya's words. And
he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He
was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than
ever now.

<head>Chapter V. Not You, Not You!</head>

<p>
On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina
Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He
suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina
Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan
might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing,
and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese
lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized
him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina
Ivanovna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, it's only you,</q> said Ivan dryly. <q>Well, good-by! You are
going to her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't advise you to; she's upset and you'll upset her more.</q>
</p>

<p>
A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I have been with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan
Fyodorovitch, you must come back, you must. Do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
There was such a peremptory note in Katya's voice that Ivan,
after a moment's hesitation, made up his mind to go back with
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>She was listening,</q> he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha
heard it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,</q> said Ivan, going into the
<pb n='676'/><anchor id='Pg676'/>
drawing-room. <q>I won't sit down. I won't stay more than a
minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> said Katerina Ivanovna, though
she remained standing. She had changed very little during this time,
but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered
afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome
at that moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>What did he ask you to tell me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Only one thing,</q> said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face,
<q>that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what</q>
(he was a little confused) <q>... passed between you ... at the
time of your first acquaintance ... in that town.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!</q> She
broke into a bitter laugh. <q>Why, is he afraid for me or for himself?
He asks me to spare&mdash;whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey
Fyodorovitch!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Both yourself and him,</q> he answered softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad to hear it,</q> she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly
blushed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she said menacingly.
<q>And I don't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to
trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will give your evidence honorably,</q> said Alyosha; <q>that's
all that's wanted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Women are often dishonorable,</q> she snarled. <q>Only an hour
ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as
though he were a reptile ... but no, he is still a human being to
me! But did he do it? Is he the murderer?</q> she cried, all of a
sudden, hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once
that she had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment
before he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth,
and that they had ended by quarreling.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded
me that he murdered his father. It's only you I believed!</q>
she continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained
smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such
familiar intimacy between them.
</p>

<pb n='677'/><anchor id='Pg677'/>

<p>
<q>Well, that's enough, anyway,</q> Ivan cut short the conversation.
<q>I am going. I'll come to-morrow.</q> And turning at once, he
walked out of the room and went straight downstairs.
</p>

<p>
With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by
both hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Follow him! Overtake him! Don't leave him alone for a minute!</q>
she said, in a hurried whisper. <q>He's mad! Don't you know
that he's mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me
so. Go, run after him....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces
ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q> He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing
that he was running after him. <q>She told you to catch me up,
because I'm mad. I know it all by heart,</q> he added irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,</q>
said Alyosha. <q>I was looking at your face just now. You look very
ill, Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out
of their mind?</q> Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a
trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,</q>
Alyosha answered with surprise.
</p>

<p>
Ivan paused for half a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,</q> he said
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,</q> said Alyosha
timidly, and he took Lise's note from his pocket and held it out to
Ivan. They were just under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the
handwriting at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, from that little demon!</q> he laughed maliciously, and, without
opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the
air. The bits were scattered by the wind.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,</q> he
said contemptuously, striding along the street again.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean, offering herself?</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='678'/><anchor id='Pg678'/>

<p>
<q>As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you, Ivan, how can you?</q> Alyosha cried warmly, in a
grieved voice. <q>She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill;
she is very ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps....
I had hoped to hear something from you ... that would
save her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her
nurse. Be quiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her. I am not even
thinking about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were silent again for a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show
her how to act to-morrow at the trial,</q> he said sharply and angrily
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Whether she's to save Mitya or ruin him. She'll pray
for light from above. She can't make up her mind for herself, you
see. She has not had time to decide yet. She takes me for her
nurse, too. She wants me to sing lullabies to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,</q> said Alyosha sadly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her
that give her hope?</q> Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. <q>I
know that you've given her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you
like this,</q> he added.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't behave to her as I ought&mdash;break off altogether and tell
her so straight out,</q> said Ivan, irritably. <q>I must wait till sentence
is passed on the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will
avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the
trial, for she hates him and knows she hates him. It's all a lie&mdash;lie
upon lie! As long as I don't break off with her, she goes on
hoping, and she won't ruin that monster, knowing how I want to
get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would come!</q>
</p>

<p>
The words <q>murderer</q> and <q>monster</q> echoed painfully in Alyosha's
heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>But how can she ruin Mitya?</q> he asked, pondering on Ivan's
words. <q>What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know that yet. She's got a document in her hands,
in Mitya's own writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder
Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q>
</p>

<pb n='679'/><anchor id='Pg679'/>

<p>
<q>That's impossible!</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why is it impossible? I've read it myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There can't be such a document!</q> Alyosha repeated warmly.
<q>There can't be, because he's not the murderer. It's not he murdered
father, not he!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan suddenly stopped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is the murderer then, according to you?</q> he asked, with
apparent coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know who,</q> Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating
voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,
Smerdyakov?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know who,</q> broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely
breathe.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who? Who?</q> Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly
vanished.
</p>

<p>
<q>I only know one thing,</q> Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper,
<q><emph>it wasn't you</emph> killed father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Not you</q>! What do you mean by <q>not you</q>?</q> Ivan was
thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was not you killed father, not you!</q> Alyosha repeated firmly.
</p>

<p>
The silence lasted for half a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know I didn't. Are you raving?</q> said Ivan, with a pale, distorted
smile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing
again under a lamp-post.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are
the murderer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said
so?</q> Ivan faltered helplessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone
during these two dreadful months,</q> Alyosha went on softly and
distinctly as before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of
himself, not of his own will, but obeying some irresistible command.
<q>You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you
are the murderer and no one else. But you didn't do it: you are
mistaken: you are not the murderer. Do you hear? It was not
you! God has sent me to tell you so.</q>
</p>

<pb n='680'/><anchor id='Pg680'/>

<p>
They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute.
They were both standing still, gazing into each other's eyes. They
were both pale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and
clutched Alyosha's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've been in my room!</q> he whispered hoarsely. <q>You've
been there at night, when he came.... Confess ... have you
seen him, have you seen him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whom do you mean&mdash;Mitya?</q> Alyosha asked, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not him, damn the monster!</q> Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. <q>Do
you know that he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is <emph>he</emph>! I don't know whom you are talking about,</q>
Alyosha faltered, beginning to be alarmed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you do know ... or how could you&mdash;? It's impossible
that you don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed
to reflect. A strange grin contorted his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, <q>I have said
this to you, because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell you
once and for all, it's not you. You hear, once for all! God has
put it into my heart to say this to you, even though it may make
you hate me from this hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> he said, with a cold smile, <q>I can't endure
prophets and epileptics&mdash;messengers from God especially&mdash;and you
know that only too well. I break off all relations with you from
this moment and probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this
turning. It's the way to your lodgings, too. You'd better be particularly
careful not to come to me to-day! Do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother,</q> Alyosha called after him, <q>if anything happens to you
to-day, turn to me before any one!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at
the cross roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he
turned and walked slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan
were living in lodgings; neither of them was willing to live in
Fyodor Pavlovitch's empty house. Alyosha had a furnished room in
the house of some working people. Ivan lived some distance from
him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached
<pb n='681'/><anchor id='Pg681'/>
to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of
an official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old
crone who went to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at
six in the morning. Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his
comforts of late, and very fond of being alone. He did everything
for himself in the one room he lived in, and rarely entered any of the
other rooms in his abode.
</p>
