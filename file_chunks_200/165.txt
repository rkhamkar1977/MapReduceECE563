she's an extraordinary woman, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank her and say I'm not coming,</q> said Alyosha, with a
strained smile. <q>Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you
my idea after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune,
brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you
Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your
brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown
motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits it's
a fraud himself&mdash;that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get
Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And
what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender
his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka.
And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness.
Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on
with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing
in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka.
His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her account
he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Mi√ºsov
called her an <q>abandoned creature.</q> He's worse than a tom-cat in
love. At first she was only employed by him in connection with
his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly
realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And
they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path!
But Grushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them,
and teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of.
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't
marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his
purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes in; he has no money,
but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to marry her! to abandon
his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and
the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been
the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated,
provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well
come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is
waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry
off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her
dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a
man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't
be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know
as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy
girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of
his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man
who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between
the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so
that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying
himself at your expense.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?</q>
Alyosha asked sharply, frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows
that you know I'm speaking the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only
the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for
thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps
it's suffering he is seeking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What wild dream now? Oh, you&mdash;aristocrats!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage.
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who
don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's phrases.
Ah, Ivan has set you a problem!</q> cried Rakitin, with undisguised
malice. His face changed, and his lips twitched. <q>And the problem's
a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains&mdash;you'll
understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous. And did
you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of
the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful. (And
by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out:
<q>I will remember!</q>) An attractive theory for scoundrels!&mdash;(I'm
being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>poseurs</foreign>, <q>haunted by profound,
unsolved doubts.</q> He's showing off,
and what it all comes to is, <q>on the one hand we cannot but admit</q>
and <q>on the other it must be confessed!</q> His whole theory is a
fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue
even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love for
freedom, for equality, for fraternity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
though remembering something, he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that's enough,</q> he said, with a still more crooked smile.
<q>Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are
clever but ... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your
getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you
are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that
for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan.
Are you jealous of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother
Ivan with you. Don't you understand that one might very well
dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil
should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why
haven't I a right to abuse him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad.
He doesn't speak of you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna's
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
he was abusing me for all he was worth&mdash;you see what an interest
he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous one
after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express the
opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an archimandrite in
the immediate future and don't become a monk, I shall be sure to
go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer,
that I shall write for the next ten years, and in the end become the
owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic
side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping
a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in with both sides
and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's account,
the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the proceeds
and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the end
of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing
offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the
Neva, which they say is to be built in Petersburg.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of
it,</q> cried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different
in my mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You
can't have been at Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking
about you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him
tell it with my own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me, but
I overheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in
Grushenka's bedroom and I couldn't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch
was in the next room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!</q> cried Rakitin,
turning crimson. <q>Are you mad? You're out of your mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being
an ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about
playing the buffoon at other men's tables, and was only admitted to
the kitchen as a favor. I may be only a priest's son, and dirt in
the eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I
couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you
to understand that!</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin was intensely irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ...
how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?</q>
Alyosha flushed suddenly. <q>I tell you again, I heard that she was a
relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself
you're not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people
had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your
business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father,
is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are.
You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it?
Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the
Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have.
Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've
broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's
shouting out something after them from the steps. And your
father's shouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing.
Bah, and there goes Mi√ºsov driving away in his carriage. You see,
he's going. And there's old Maximov running!&mdash;there must have
been a row. There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not
been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been
beaten? It would serve them right!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a
scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse
of a moment.
</p>

<head>Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene</head>

<p>
Mi√ºsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but
feel some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's
with Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt
that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's
cell, and so to have forgotten himself. <q>The monks were not to
blame, in any case,</q> he reflected, on the steps. <q>And if they're
decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't
argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
them that I've nothing to do with that √Üsop,
that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this
affair, just as they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and
relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once.
He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become
much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the
wood and river in question were.
</p>

<p>
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the
Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not
a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether;
they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than
Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing
of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered
with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not
even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there
were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous
thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully
decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were
three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent
mead, and a large glass jug of kvas&mdash;both the latter made in
the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no
vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup
made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish
served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote,
and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these
good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where
he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got
information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious
temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and
nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would
play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable,
and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the
contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table
he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any
one else could have influenced him in that.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be
invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Pa√Øssy, and one
other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They
were already waiting when Mi√ºsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The
Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his
guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black
hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed
to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive
his blessing. Mi√ºsov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and
Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted
and complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.
</p>

<p>
<q>We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,</q> began Mi√ºsov,
simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.
<q>Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor
of your hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father
Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with
his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ...
in fact, quite unseemly ... as</q>&mdash;he glanced at the monks&mdash;<q>your
reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognizing
that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and
begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
place.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Mi√ºsov completely recovered
his self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation
disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
</p>

<p>
The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a
slight bend of the head, replied:
</p>

<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>

<p>
<q>I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might
have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud.
All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before
him, with peculiar fervor.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last
prank. It must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and
really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father
Superior as though nothing had happened, after his disgraceful behavior
in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed
of himself&mdash;quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would
be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly
been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it,
when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own words
at the elder's: <q>I always feel when I meet people that I am lower
than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play
the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than
I.</q> He longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness.
He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been
asked, <q>Why do you hate so and so, so much?</q> And he had answered
them, with his shameless impudence, <q>I'll tell you. He has
done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since
I have hated him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating
for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively
quivered. <q>Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,</q> he
decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed
in the following words, <q>Well, there is no rehabilitating
myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will
show them I don't care what they think&mdash;that's all!</q>
</p>

<p>
He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned
to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no
clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control
himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of
obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for
which he could be legally punished. In the last resort, he could
always restrain himself, and had marveled indeed at himself, on that
score, sometimes. He appeared in the Father Superior's dining-room,
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving
to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company,
and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
them all boldly in the face. <q>They thought I had gone, and here
I am again,</q> he cried to the whole room.
</p>

<p>
For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at
once every one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively
scandalous, was about to happen. Mi√ºsov passed immediately from
the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the
feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>No! this I cannot endure!</q> he cried. <q>I absolutely cannot! and ...
I certainly cannot!</q>
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he
was beyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it he cannot?</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>that he absolutely
cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come
in or not? Will you receive me as your guest?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are welcome with all my heart,</q> answered the Superior.
<q>Gentlemen!</q> he added, <q>I venture to beg you most earnestly to
lay aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family
harmony&mdash;with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, it is impossible!</q> cried Mi√ºsov, beside himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible
for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep
with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain.
You stung him by what you said about family harmony,
Father Superior, he does not admit he is my relation. That's right,
isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you mean me?</q> muttered Maximov, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I mean you,</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. <q>Who else?
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von
Sohn was? It was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house
of harlotry&mdash;I believe that is what such places are called among
you&mdash;he was killed and robbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he
<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>
was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the
luggage van, and while they were nailing him up, the harlots sang
songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that
very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is happening? What's this?</q> voices were heard in the
group of monks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go,</q> cried Mi√ºsov, addressing Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, excuse me,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another
step into the room. <q>Allow me to finish. There in the cell
you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of
eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Mi√ºsov, my relation, prefers
to have <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plus de noblesse que de sinc√©rit√©</foreign>
in his words, but I prefer in mine <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>plus de
sinc√©rit√© que de noblesse</foreign>, and&mdash;damn the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>noblesse</foreign>!
That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though
I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor,
and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in
Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else.
I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,
Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare,
and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have
been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give
you the last act of the performance. You know how things are
with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so
it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again.
Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a great
sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but
there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can it be
right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to
confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and
so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one
that I did this and that ... well, you understand what&mdash;sometimes
it would not be proper to talk about it&mdash;so it is really a scandal!
No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants,
I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod,
and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.</q>
</p>

<p>
We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look
for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors
which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our
<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>
monastery, but in others where the institution of elders existed)
that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment
of the authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament
of confession and so on and so on&mdash;absurd charges which had died
away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had
caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the current
of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,
prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not
understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for
on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in
the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind.
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But
as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking
absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience,
and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense.
And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would
be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,
and plunged forward blindly.
</p>

<p>
<q>How disgraceful!</q> cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me!</q> said the Father Superior. <q>It was said of old,
<q>Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil
sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the
correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.</q>
And so we humbly thank you, honored guest!</q> and he made Fyodor
Pavlovitch a low bow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut&mdash;sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old
phrases and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We
know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart,
as in Schiller's <hi rend='italic'>Robbers</hi>. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want
the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that
I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you
expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will
come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in
the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a
monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward
up aloft for it&mdash;you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too,
Father Superior. What have they got here?</q> He went up to the
table. <q>Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie,
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the
bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided
it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing
earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the
tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy fathers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is too disgraceful!</q> said Father Iosif.
</p>

<p>
Father Pa√Øssy kept obstinately silent. Mi√ºsov rushed from the
room, and Kalganov after him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not
coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't
come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep
your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my
revenge for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured.</q> He
thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling.
<q>This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost
me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,
against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories
about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of
Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand,
nor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get
out of me!</q>
</p>

<p>
It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any
great part in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.
But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was
for one moment almost believing it himself. He was so touched he
was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was
time to draw back.
</p>

<p>
The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again
spoke impressively:
</p>

<p>
<q>It is written again, <q>Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor
that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded
and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.</q> And so will we.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.
Bethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son,
Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan
Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to
follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see
me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst;
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We
will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've
cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.</q> He
went out, shouting and gesticulating.
</p>

<p>
It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey!</q> his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him.
<q>You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow
and mattress, and leave no trace behind.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.
Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan
was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to
say good-by to Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible
scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode.
Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran
up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw
him running. He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put
his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and
clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in. <q>I am going
with you!</q> he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a
look of reckless glee in his face. <q>Take me, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There!</q> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. <q>Did I not say he
was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why,
how did you tear yourself away? What did you <hi rend='italic'>vonsohn</hi> there?
And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a
brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you,
brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun.
He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von
Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the
box, von Sohn!</q>
</p>

<p>
But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave
Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was
quite by chance he did not fall.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on!</q> Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you
do that?</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.
</p>

<p>
But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you are a fellow,</q> Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
</p>

<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>

<p>
After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, <q>Why,
it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you
approved of it. Why are you angry now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,</q> Ivan
snapped sullenly.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>A drop of brandy would be nice now,</q> he observed sententiously,
but Ivan made no response.
</p>

<p>
<q>You shall have some, too, when we get home.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan was still silent.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you
will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away
stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.

<head>Chapter I. In The Servants' Quarters</head>

<p>
The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the
town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking
old house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was
roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all
sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases. There
were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike
them. <q>One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone in the
evening,</q> he used to say. It was his habit to send the servants
away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone. The
lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor Pavlovitch
used to have the cooking done there, although there was a kitchen
in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter and
summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The
house was built for a large family; there was room for five times
as many, with their servants. But at the time of our story there
was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son
Ivan. And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory,
and his old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov. Of
these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said
something already. He was firm and determined and went blindly
and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought by any
reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that it
was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife,
Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her
life, yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the
serfs. She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little
shop in Moscow with their small savings. But Grigory decided then,
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
once for all, that <q>the woman's talking nonsense, for every woman
is dishonest,</q> and that they ought not to leave their old master,
whatever he might be, for <q>that was now their duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you understand what duty is?</q> he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why
it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand,</q> Marfa answered
firmly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold
your tongue.</q>
</p>

<p>
And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch
promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory
knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his master.
It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an
obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong
enough <q>in some of the affairs of life,</q> as he expressed it, he found
himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other
emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them.
There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And
that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most
trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor
Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's
intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him a
good lecture. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch
was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle
and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained
the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted,
which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a
moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often
cruel in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was
sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious
terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form.
<q>My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times,</q> he used to
say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand,
in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and
unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his
secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that, not to
oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him with
anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need,
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
to defend him&mdash;from whom? From somebody unknown, but
terrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there
was <emph>another</emph> man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him
in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange
some quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old
servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry,
he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that
Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and
fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch
would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would
soon let him go again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he
had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and
sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had happened
to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha <q>pierced
his heart</q> by <q>living with him, seeing everything and blaming
nothing.</q> Moreover, Alyosha brought with him something his
father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt
for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected
devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was a
complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family
ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till
then loved nothing but <q>evil.</q> When Alyosha had left him, he
confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not
till then been willing to learn.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adela√Øda
Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of
Dmitri, and that he had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna,
the poor <q>crazy woman,</q> against his master and any one who
chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy
wife had become something sacred to him, so that even now,
twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to her
from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,
Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his
words, without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight
whether he loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love
her, and she knew it.
</p>

<p>
Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,
cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>
in worldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything
without question or complaint ever since her marriage, and respected
him for his spiritual superiority. It was remarkable how little they
spoke to one another in the course of their lives, and only of the
most necessary daily affairs. The grave and dignified Grigory
thought over all his cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna
had long grown used to knowing that he did not need her
advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took
it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once,
and then only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's
marriage with Adela√Øda Ivanovna, the village girls and
women&mdash;at that time serfs&mdash;were called together before the house
to sing and dance. They were beginning <q>In the Green Meadows,</q>
when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and
danced <q>the Russian Dance,</q> not in the village fashion, but as she
had danced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich
Mi√ºsov family, in their private theater, where the actors were taught
to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his
wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave
her a lesson, pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating
was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
</p>

<p>
God had not blessed them with children. One child was born
but it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of
showing it. When Adela√Øda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took
Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his hair and washed
him in a tub with his own hands, and looked after him for almost
a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for
which the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in the
face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his
own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth.
When it was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The
baby had six fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was
not only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the
garden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen
garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean-time
Grigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage
where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god-father, he suddenly
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
announced that the baby <q>ought not to be christened at all.</q>
He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing
with dull intentness at the priest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not?</q> asked the priest with good-humored surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because it's a dragon,</q> muttered Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>A dragon? What dragon?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grigory did not speak for some time. <q>It's a confusion of nature,</q>
he muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to
say more.
</p>

<p>
They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory
prayed earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child
remained unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long
as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to
notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when,
at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid
the child in its little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when
they were filling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and
bowed down to the earth. He did not for years afterwards mention
his child, nor did Marfa speak of the baby before him, and, even if
Grigory were not present, she never spoke of it above a whisper.
Marfa observed that, from the day of the burial, he devoted himself
to <q>religion,</q> and took to reading the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>,
for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and always putting on his
big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read aloud, only
perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow
got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of <q>the God-fearing
Father Isaac the Syrian,</q> which he read persistently for
years together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing
and loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to
the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood.
He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go
over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him
an expression of still greater gravity.
</p>

<p>
He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his
deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design,
been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which,
as he said later, had left a <q>stamp</q> upon his soul. It happened that,
on the very night after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
by the wail of a new-born baby. She was frightened and waked
her husband. He listened and said he thought it was more like
some one groaning, <q>it might be a woman.</q> He got up and dressed.
It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he
distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from
the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no
other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong,
high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern,
took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of
his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and
that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the
garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from
the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were
the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath-house, he
saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about
the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of
Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-house
and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the
baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to
speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter II. Lizaveta</head>

<p>
There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly,
and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This
Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, <q>not five foot within a wee bit,</q>
as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after
her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy
and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek
expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted,
wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost
black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap
on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits
of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the
ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman
with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead.
Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever
she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in
the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially
dear to God. Ilya's employers, and many others in the town,
especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better, and always
rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter.
But, although she allowed them to dress her up without resisting,
she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch, and
taking off all that had been given her&mdash;kerchief, sheepskin, skirt
or boots&mdash;she left them there and walked away barefoot in her
smock as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor
of the province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw
Lizaveta, and was wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And
though he was told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young
woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a
breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor
went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her
father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of
the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one
seemed to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of
our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She
would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every
one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were given a
copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms-jug of
the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market,
she would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would
stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the
lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything
but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,
where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept
watch on her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles
overlooked by them, she would not have touched a farthing. She
scarcely ever went to church. She slept either in the church porch
or climbed over a hurdle (there are many hurdles instead of fences
to this day in our town) into a kitchen garden. She used at least
once a week to turn up <q>at home,</q> that is at the house of her
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>
father's former employers, and in the winter went there every night,
and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People were amazed
that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to it, and,
although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some of
the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but
that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from
time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have
been proud?
</p>

<p>
It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September
(many years ago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from
the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions.
They passed through the <q>back-way,</q> which led between the back
gardens of the houses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads
out on to the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were
accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles and burdocks under
the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look
at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness.
It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry
whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a
woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance
that it was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was
among them, sprang forward and declared that it was by no means
impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it,
and so on.... It is true that at that time he was overdoing his
part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and entertain
the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality
he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time when
he had received the news of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and,
with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly
that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of
him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion;
and one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The
others repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with
the utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way. Later on,
Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them, and perhaps
it was so, no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew. But
five or six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and
sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find out
<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>
who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a
terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no
other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of
that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still
among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the
father of grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the
tale, even if there had been any foundation for it. But rumor
pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at
him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not
have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he
was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle
of the officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.
</p>

<p>
At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He
provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded
in bringing some people round to his side. <q>It's the wench's own
fault,</q> he asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict,
who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us,
as he had hidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible,
for it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just
at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people. But this
affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy
from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A
well-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take
her into her house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go
out until after the confinement. They kept a constant watch over
her, but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day,
and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her
condition, she managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained
a mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted
over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The
most likely explanation is that it happened naturally&mdash;that Lizaveta,
accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow
managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had
leapt down, injuring herself.
</p>

<p>
Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran
to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby,
but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home,
and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. <q>A child of God&mdash;an
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
orphan is akin to all,</q> he said, <q>and to us above others. Our
little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son
and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to
which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor).
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it
amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility.
The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later
on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him
Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.
</p>

<p>
So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant,
and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our
story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something
of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention
so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back
to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.

<head>Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&mdash;In Verse</head>

<p>
Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the
command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But
in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his
way. He went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father
had been doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way
he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten
to add that his father's shouts, commanding him to return home
<q>with his mattress and pillow</q> did not frighten him in the least.
He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely
<q>a flourish</q> to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in
our town who was celebrating his name-day with a party of friends,
getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own
crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife's clothes, and
finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of
course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers.
Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery
<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>
next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded
that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt
him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would
want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could
hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without
question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him,
and worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was
the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently
entreated him in the note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to
come and see her about something. This request and the necessity
of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart, and this
feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite
of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father Superior's. He was
not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak of and
what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a
woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life,
from early childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with
women. He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He
had been afraid of her from the first time he saw her. He had only
seen her two or three times, and had only chanced to say a few
words to her. He thought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious
girl. It was not her beauty which troubled him, but something
else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension
itself. The girl's aims were of the noblest, he knew that.
She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,
though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha
recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments,
a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her
house.
</p>

<p>
He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate
a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father.
Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had
a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with
her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri
before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he
could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and
he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute,
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed
gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the
direction of his terrible lady.
</p>

<p>
He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then
across the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our
town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And
meanwhile his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not yet
forgotten his command. He might be unreasonable, and so he had
to make haste to get there and back. So he decided to take a short
cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the ground. This
meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other
people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted
him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.
</p>

<p>
He had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging
to a little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of
this house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with
her daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals'
families in Petersburg. Now she had been at home a year, looking
after her sick mother. She always dressed up in fine clothes, though
her old mother and she had sunk into such poverty that they went
every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which
Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up for
soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even
had a long train&mdash;a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin,
who always knew everything that was going on in the town. He
had forgotten it as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the
garden, he remembered the dress with the train, raised his head,
which had been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite
unexpected.
</p>

<p>
Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something,
was leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously
afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha
ran up to the hurdle.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,</q>
Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper. <q>Climb in here quickly!
How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
the hurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help
him jump. Tucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle
with the agility of a bare-legged street urchin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done! Now come along,</q> said Mitya in an enthusiastic
whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where?</q> whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself
in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The
garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no one here. Why do you whisper?</q> asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!</q> cried Dmitri at the top of
his voice. <q rend='pre'>You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here
in secret, and on the watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's
a secret, I began whispering like a fool, when there's no need. Let
us go. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you.</q>
</p>
