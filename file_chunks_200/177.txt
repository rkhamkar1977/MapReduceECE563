the scandal could have reached such proportions. For in the past,
monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men, whose saintliness
was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too,
the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead
bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.
Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the
monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics,
according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption. This fact
was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the
tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous,
and as a promise, by God's grace, of still greater glory from their
tombs in the future.
</p>

<p>
One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old
monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred
and five. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and
silence, and his tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival
with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected
with it. (That was the very tomb on which Father Païssy had
found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another memory cherished
in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy, who was
only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the eldership.
He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all the
pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these
had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no
signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had
been a holy light in their faces. And some people even insisted that
a sweet fragrance came from their bodies.
</p>

<pb n='367'/><anchor id='Pg367'/>

<p>
Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to
explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested
beside the coffin of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that
several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which
was the deeply-rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a
pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of
many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead
man's saintliness, so firmly established during his lifetime that it was
almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though the late elder
had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles, and had
gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in
fact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy
and so had come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in
the monastery but in the world outside it. He did no one any
harm, but <q>Why do they think him so saintly?</q> And that question
alone, gradually repeated, gave rise at last to an intense, insatiable
hatred of him. That, I believe, was why many people were extremely
delighted at the smell of decomposition which came so
quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the same time
there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently
devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally
affronted by this incident. This was how the thing happened.
</p>

<p>
As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole
aspect of the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the
cell. They went in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm
the news to the crowd of other monks waiting outside. Some
of the latter shook their heads mournfully, but others did not even
care to conceal the delight which gleamed unmistakably in their
malignant eyes. And now no one reproached them for it, no one
raised his voice in protest, which was strange, for the majority of
the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But it seemed as
though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand
for a time.
</p>

<p>
Visitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon
went into the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry
few went into the cell, though there were crowds of them at
the gates of the hermitage. After three o'clock the rush of worldly
visitors was greatly increased and this was no doubt owing to the
<pb n='368'/><anchor id='Pg368'/>
shocking news. People were attracted who would not otherwise
have come on that day and had not intended to come, and among
them were some personages of high standing. But external decorum
was still preserved and Father Païssy, with a stern face, continued
firmly and distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing
what was taking place around him, though he had, in fact,
observed something unusual long before. But at last the murmurs,
first subdued but gradually louder and more confident, reached even
him. <q>It shows God's judgment is not as man's,</q> Father Païssy
heard suddenly. The first to give utterance to this sentiment was
a layman, an elderly official from the town, known to be a man of
great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had long
been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning
conclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction
at that conclusion became more and more apparent every
moment. Soon they began to lay aside even external decorum and
almost seemed to feel they had a sort of right to discard it.
</p>

<p>
<q>And for what reason can <emph>this</emph> have happened,</q> some of the
monks said, at first with a show of regret; <q>he had a small frame
and his flesh was dried up on his bones, what was there to decay?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It must be a sign from heaven,</q> others hastened to add, and
their opinion was adopted at once without protest. For it was
pointed out, too, that if the decomposition had been natural, as in
the case of every dead sinner, it would have been apparent later,
after a lapse of at least twenty-four hours, but this premature corruption
<q>was in excess of nature,</q> and so the finger of God was
evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed irresistible.
</p>

<p>
Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead
man's, tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that <q>this is not
held everywhere alike,</q> and that the incorruptibility of the bodies
of the just was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an
opinion, and that even in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for
instance, they were not greatly confounded by the smell of corruption,
and there the chief sign of the glorification of the saved was
not bodily incorruptibility, but the color of the bones when the
bodies have lain many years in the earth and have decayed in it.
<q>And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign that the
<pb n='369'/><anchor id='Pg369'/>
Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow but black,
it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such glory&mdash;that is
the belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has
been preserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,</q>
said Father Iosif in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
But the meek Father's words had little effect and even provoked
a mocking retort. <q>That's all pedantry and innovation, no use
listening to it,</q> the monks decided. <q>We stick to the old doctrine,
there are all sorts of innovations nowadays, are we to follow them
all?</q> added others.
</p>

<p>
<q>We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are
among the Turks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine
has long been impure and they have no bells even,</q> the most sneering
added.
</p>

<p>
Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward
his own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing
in it himself. He foresaw with distress that something very
unseemly was beginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience.
Little by little, all the sensible monks were reduced to
silence like Father Iosif. And so it came to pass that all who loved
the elder and had accepted with devout obedience the institution of
the eldership were all at once terribly cast down and glanced timidly
in one another's faces, when they met. Those who were hostile to
the institution of elders, as a novelty, held up their heads proudly.
<q>There was no smell of corruption from the late elder Varsonofy,
but a sweet fragrance,</q> they recalled malignantly. <q>But he gained
that glory not because he was an elder, but because he was a holy
man.</q>
</p>

<p>
And this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of
Father Zossima. <q>His teaching was false; he taught that life is a
great joy and not a vale of tears,</q> said some of the more unreasonable.
<q>He followed the fashionable belief, he did not recognize
material fire in hell,</q> others, still more unreasonable, added. <q>He
was not strict in fasting, allowed himself sweet things, ate cherry
jam with his tea, ladies used to send it to him. Is it for a monk of
strict rule to drink tea?</q> could be heard among some of the envious.
<q>He sat in pride,</q> the most malignant declared vindictively; <q>he
considered himself a saint and he took it as his due when people
<pb n='370'/><anchor id='Pg370'/>
knelt before him.</q> <q>He abused the sacrament of confession,</q> the
fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious
whisper. And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest
in their devotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the
life of the deceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips.
And this was terrible, for their words had great influence on young
monks who were not yet firm in their convictions. The monk from
Obdorsk heard all this attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding
his head. <q>Yes, clearly Father Ferapont was right in his judgment
yesterday,</q> and at that moment Father Ferapont himself made his
appearance, as though on purpose to increase the confusion.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by
the apiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked
this neglect on the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him
to the rules binding on all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be
told, they hardly had a choice about it. For it would have been
discreditable to insist on burdening with the common regulations
so great an ascetic, who prayed day and night (he even dropped
asleep on his knees). If they had insisted, the monks would have
said, <q>He is holier than all of us and he follows a rule harder than
ours. And if he does not go to church, it's because he knows when
he ought to; he has his own rule.</q> It was to avoid the chance of
these sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.
</p>

<p>
As every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked
Father Zossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that
<q>God's judgment is not the same as man's,</q> and that something had
happened which was <q>in excess of nature.</q> It may well be supposed
that among the first to run to him with the news was the
monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him the evening before and
left his cell terror-stricken.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned above, that though Father Païssy, standing firm
and immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear
nor see what was passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly
in his heart, for he knew the men surrounding him, well. He
was not shaken by it, but awaited what would come next without
fear, watching with penetration and insight for the outcome of the
general excitement.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance
<pb n='371'/><anchor id='Pg371'/>
of decorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father
Ferapont appeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen
accompanying him a crowd of monks, together with many people
from the town. They did not, however, enter the cell, but stood at
the bottom of the steps, waiting to see what Father Ferapont would
say or do. For they felt with a certain awe, in spite of their audacity,
that he had not come for nothing. Standing in the doorway,
Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under his right arm the keen
inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped in. He
alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up the steps
after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed farther
back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open. Holding
his hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared:
</p>

<p>
<q>Casting out I cast out!</q> and, turning in all directions, he began
at once making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and
four corners of the cell in succession. All who accompanied Father
Ferapont immediately understood his action. For they knew he
always did this wherever he went, and that he would not sit down
or say a word, till he had driven out the evil spirits.
</p>

<p>
<q>Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!</q> he repeated at each sign of
the cross. <q>Casting out I cast out,</q> he roared again.
</p>

<p>
He was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest,
covered with gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His
feet were bare. As soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel
irons he wore under his gown could be heard clanking.
</p>

<p>
Father Païssy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood
before him waiting.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend
against good order? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?</q>
he said at last, looking sternly at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?</q>
shouted Father Ferapont crazily. <q>I've come here to drive out your
visitors, the unclean devils. I've come to see how many have
gathered here while I have been away. I want to sweep them out
with a birch broom.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him
yourself,</q> Father Païssy went on fearlessly. <q>And who can say
of himself <q>I am holy</q>? Can you, Father?</q>
</p>

<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>

<p>
<q>I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and
would not have them bow down to me as an idol,</q> thundered Father
Ferapont. <q>Nowadays folk destroy the true faith. The dead man,
your saint,</q> he turned to the crowd, pointing with his finger to the
coffin, <q>did not believe in devils. He gave medicine to keep off the
devils. And so they have become as common as spiders in the
corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In that we see
a great sign from God.</q>
</p>

<p>
The incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was
haunted in his dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions
of evil spirits. When in the utmost terror he confided this to Father
Zossima, the elder had advised continual prayer and rigid fasting.
But when that was of no use, he advised him, while persisting in
prayer and fasting, to take a special medicine. Many persons were
shocked at the time and wagged their heads as they talked over it&mdash;and
most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of the censorious
had hastened to report this <q>extraordinary</q> counsel on the part of
the elder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away, Father!</q> said Father Païssy, in a commanding voice,
<q>it's not for man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a
<q>sign</q> which neither you, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend.
Go, Father, and do not trouble the flock!</q> he repeated impressively.
</p>

<p>
<q>He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore
the sign has come. That is clear and it's a sin to hide it,</q> the
fanatic, carried away by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would
not be quieted. <q>He was seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought
them to him in their pockets, he sipped tea, he worshiped his belly,
filling it with sweet things and his mind with haughty thoughts....
And for this he is put to shame....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You speak lightly, Father.</q> Father Païssy, too, raised his voice.
<q>I admire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some
frivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command
you!</q> Father Païssy thundered in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go,</q> said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but
still as bitter. <q>You learned men! You are so clever you look down
upon my humbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I
<pb n='373'/><anchor id='Pg373'/>
have forgotten what I did know, God Himself has preserved me in
my weakness from your subtlety.</q>
</p>

<p>
Father Païssy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont
paused and, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently,
pronounced in a sing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the
dead elder:
</p>

<p>
<q>To-morrow they will sing over him <q>Our Helper and Defender</q>&mdash;a
splendid anthem&mdash;and over me when I die all they'll sing will be
<q>What earthly joy</q>&mdash;a little canticle,</q><note place='foot'>When
a monk's body is carried out from the cell to the church and from the
church to the graveyard, the canticle <q>What earthly joy...</q> is sung. If the
deceased was a priest as well as a monk the canticle <q>Our Helper and Defender</q>
is sung instead.</note> he added with tearful regret.
<q>You are proud and puffed up, this is a vain place!</q> he shouted suddenly
like a madman, and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly
and quickly descended the steps. The crowd awaiting him below
wavered; some followed him at once and some lingered, for the cell
was still open, and Father Païssy, following Father Ferapont on to
the steps, stood watching him. But the excited old fanatic was not
completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away, he suddenly
turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms and, as though
some one had cut him down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.
</p>

<p>
<q>My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!</q>
he shouted frantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and
falling face downwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child,
shaken by his tears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then
all rushed up to him; there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ...
a kind of frenzy seemed to take possession of them all.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy
man!</q> some cried aloud, losing their fear. <q>This is he who should be
an elder,</q> others added malignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He wouldn't be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldn't
serve a cursed innovation ... he wouldn't imitate their foolery,</q>
other voices chimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they
might have gone, but at that moment the bell rang summoning
them to service. All began crossing themselves at once. Father
Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself went back to his cell
without looking round, still uttering exclamations which were
<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>
utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the greater number
dispersed, hastening to service. Father Païssy let Father Iosif read
in his place and went down. The frantic outcries of bigots could
not shake him, but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy
for some special reason and he felt that. He stood still and suddenly
wondered, <q>Why am I sad even to dejection?</q> and immediately
grasped with surprise that his sudden sadness was due to a
very small and special cause. In the crowd thronging at the entrance
to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and he remembered that he had
felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him. <q>Can that boy mean so
much to my heart now?</q> he asked himself, wondering.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in
the direction of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly
turned away his eyes and dropped them to the ground, and from
the boy's look alone, Father Païssy guessed what a great change was
taking place in him at that moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you, too, fallen into temptation?</q> cried Father Païssy.
<q>Can you be with those of little faith?</q> he added mournfully.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Païssy, but
quickly turned his eyes away again and again looked on the ground.
He stood sideways and did not turn his face to Father Païssy, who
watched him attentively.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,</q> he asked
again, but again Alyosha gave no answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave,
without asking a blessing?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange,
look at the Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign
of his heart and mind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay
dying. And suddenly, still without speaking, waved his hand, as
though not caring even to be respectful, and with rapid steps walked
towards the gates away from the hermitage.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will come back again!</q> murmured Father Païssy, looking
after him with sorrowful surprise.

<head>Chapter II. A Critical Moment</head>

<p>
Father Païssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided
that his <q>dear boy</q> would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to
some extent, he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of
Alyosha's spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it
would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange,
vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To
Father Païssy's sorrowful question, <q>Are you too with those of little
faith?</q> I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, <q>No, he
is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.</q> Indeed, all
his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still
the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards
Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest
and most fatal days of his life. If the question is asked: <q>Could all
his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his
elder's body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of
at once performing miracles?</q> I must answer without beating about
the bush, <q>Yes, it certainly was.</q> I would only beg the reader not
to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero's pure heart.
I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent
faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had
made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare, on the
contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his heart.
No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love
was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so
of little value, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what
happened to my hero. But in some cases it is really more creditable
to be carried away by an emotion, however unreasonable, which
springs from a great love, than to be unmoved. And this is even
truer in youth, for a young man who is always sensible is to be
suspected and is of little worth&mdash;that's my opinion!
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, <q>every young man
cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for
others.</q>
</p>

<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>

<p>
To this I reply again, <q>Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and
steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should
not explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary
for the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say
then, it was not a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and
impatient expectation of miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed
no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea&mdash;oh,
no, not at all&mdash;what he saw before all was one figure&mdash;the figure
of his beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he revered
with such adoration. The fact is that all the love that lay concealed
in his pure young heart for every one and everything had, for the
past year, been concentrated&mdash;and perhaps wrongly so&mdash;on one
being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long been
accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy
could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the
moment <q>of every one and everything.</q> He remembered afterwards
how, on that terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his
brother Dmitri, about whom he had been so anxious and troubled the
day before; he had forgotten, too, to take the two hundred roubles
to Ilusha's father, though he had so warmly intended to do so the
preceding evening. But again it was not miracles he needed but only
<q>the higher justice</q> which had been in his belief outraged by the
blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his heart. And
what does it signify that this <q>justice</q> looked for by Alyosha inevitably
took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the
ashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery
cherished the same thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects
Alyosha revered, Father Païssy himself, for instance. And
so Alyosha, untroubled by doubts, clothed his dreams too in the
same form as all the rest. And a whole year of life in the monastery
had formed the habit of this expectation in his heart. But it was
justice, justice, he thirsted for, not simply miracles.
</p>

<p>
And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted
above every one in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving
the glory that was his due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored!
What for? Who had judged him? Who could have decreed this?
Those were the questions that wrung his inexperienced and virginal
<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>
heart. He could not endure without mortification, without resentment
even, that the holiest of holy men should have been exposed
to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior
to him. Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing
marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why this humiliation,
why this premature decay, <q>in excess of nature,</q> as the spiteful
monks said? Why this <q>sign from heaven,</q> which they so triumphantly
acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did
they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the
finger of Providence? Why did Providence hide its face <q>at the most
critical moment</q> (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily
submitting to the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?
</p>

<p>
That was why Alyosha's heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I
have said already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above
everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated! This
murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero,
but I repeat again for the third time&mdash;and am prepared to admit
that it might be difficult to defend my feeling&mdash;I am glad that my
hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment, for any man
of sense will always come back to reason in time, but, if love does
not gain the upper hand in a boy's heart at such an exceptional moment,
when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention something
strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha's
mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was
the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which
now persistently haunted Alyosha's mind. At this moment it
haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental,
elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken. He loved
his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was suddenly
murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil
impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly
revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to
the surface of his consciousness.
</p>

It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse
from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha,
lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and
apparently asleep. He went up and called him by his name.
</p>

<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>

<p>
<q>You here, Alexey? Can you have&mdash;</q> he began wondering but
broke off. He had meant to say, <q>Can you have come to this?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin
at once saw that he heard and understood him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter?</q> he went on; but the surprise in his face
gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You
suddenly disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this?
You might just look at me...</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the
tree. He was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and
irritability in his face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but
looked away to one side of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know your face is quite changed? There's none of your
famous mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one?
Have they been ill-treating you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me alone,</q> said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of
his hand, still looking away from him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oho! So that's how we are feeling! So you can shout at people
like other mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say,
Alyosha, you have surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It's long
since I've been surprised at anything here. I always took you for an
educated man....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely
understanding what he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has
begun to stink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that
he was going to work miracles?</q> exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what
more do you want?</q> cried Alyosha irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of
thirteen believes in that now. But there.... So now you are in a
temper with your God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn't
given promotion, He hasn't bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you
are a set!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin,
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>
and there was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger
with Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not rebelling against my God; I simply <q>don't accept His
world.</q></q> Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you mean, you don't accept the world?</q> Rakitin
thought a moment over his answer. <q>What idiocy is this?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha did not answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything
to eat to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't remember.... I think I have.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry
to look at you. You didn't sleep all night either, I hear, you had
a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most
likely you've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I've
got some sausage in my pocket; I've brought it from the town in
case of need, only you won't eat sausage....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me some.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with barricades!
Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to
my place.... I shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired
to death. Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose ... or would
you like some?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me some vodka too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hullo! You surprise me, brother!</q> Rakitin looked at him in
amazement. <q>Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a
jolly fine chance and mustn't be missed. Come along.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>If your little brother Ivan could see this&mdash;wouldn't he be surprised!
By the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this
morning, did you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of
his brother Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute,
and though it reminded him of something that must not be put off
for a moment, some duty, some terrible obligation, even that reminder
made no impression on him, did not reach his heart and
instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten. But, a long
while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a <q>liberal booby
<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>
with no talents whatsoever.</q> Once you, too, could not resist letting
me know I was <q>dishonorable.</q> Well! I should like to see what
your talents and sense of honor will do for you now.</q> This phrase
Rakitin finished to himself in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen!</q> he said aloud, <q>let's go by the path beyond the monastery
straight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov's
by the way. Only fancy, I've written to tell her everything
that happened, and would you believe it, she answered me instantly
in pencil (the lady has a passion for writing notes) that <q>she
would never have expected <emph>such conduct</emph> from a man of such a
reverend character as Father Zossima.</q> That was her very word:
<q>conduct.</q> She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!</q> he cried
suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the
shoulder made him stop too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, Alyosha,</q> he peeped inquisitively into his eyes,
absorbed in a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and
though he was laughing outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter
that new idea aloud, so difficult he still found it to believe in the
strange and unexpected mood in which he now saw Alyosha.
<q>Alyosha, do you know where we had better go?</q> he brought out
at last timidly, and insinuatingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't care ... where you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?</q> pronounced Rakitin
at last, trembling with timid suspense.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's go to Grushenka,</q> Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and
this prompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin
that he almost started back.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well! I say!</q> he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly
by the arm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would
change his mind.
</p>

<p>
They walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to
talk.
</p>

<p>
<q>And how glad she will be, how delighted!</q> he muttered, but
lapsed into silence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka
he was taking Alyosha to her. He was a practical person and never
undertook anything without a prospect of gain for himself. His
object in this case was twofold, first a revengeful desire to see <q>the
downfall of the righteous,</q> and Alyosha's fall <q>from the saints
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>
to the sinners,</q> over which he was already gloating in his imagination,
and in the second place he had in view a certain material gain
for himself, of which more will be said later.
</p>

<p>
<q>So the critical moment has come,</q> he thought to himself with
spiteful glee, <q>and we shall catch it on the hop, for it's just what
we want.</q>

<head>Chapter III. An Onion</head>

<p>
Grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the
cathedral square, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard
belonging to the house of the widow Morozov. The house was a
large stone building of two stories, old and very ugly. The widow
led a secluded life with her two unmarried nieces, who were also
elderly women. She had no need to let her lodge, but every one
knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years
before, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who
was known to be the girl's protector. It was said that the jealous
old man's object in placing his <q>favorite</q> with the widow Morozov
was that the old woman should keep a sharp eye on her new lodger's
conduct. But this sharp eye soon proved to be unnecessary, and in
the end the widow Morozov seldom met Grushenka and did not
worry her by looking after her in any way. It is true that four
years had passed since the old man had brought the slim, delicate,
shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town
of the province, and much had happened since then. Little was
known of the girl's history in the town and that little was vague.
Nothing more had been learnt during the last four years, even after
many persons had become interested in the beautiful young woman
into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna had meanwhile developed.
There were rumors that she had been at seventeen betrayed by
some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards abandoned
by him. The officer had gone away and afterwards married,
while Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. It was
said, however, that though Grushenka had been raised from destitution
by the old man, Samsonov, she came of a respectable family
<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>
belonging to the clerical class, that she was the daughter of a deacon
or something of the sort.
</p>

<p>
And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic
little orphan had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type,
a woman of bold and determined character, proud and insolent. She
had a good head for business, was acquisitive, saving and careful,
and by fair means or foul had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a
little fortune. There was only one point on which all were agreed.
Grushenka was not easily to be approached and except her aged
protector there had not been one man who could boast of her favors
during those four years. It was a positive fact, for there had been
a good many, especially during the last two years, who had attempted
to obtain those favors. But all their efforts had been in
vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified
and even comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance
they met from the strong-willed young person. It was known, too,
that the young person had, especially of late, been given to what
is called <q>speculation,</q> and that she had shown marked abilities in
that direction, so that many people began to say that she was no
better than a Jew. It was not that she lent money on interest, but
it was known, for instance, that she had for some time past, in
partnership with old Karamazov, actually invested in the purchase
of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their nominal value, and afterwards
had made out of them ten times their value.
</p>

<p>
The old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy
and merciless. He tyrannized over his grown-up sons, but, for the
last year during which he had been ill and lost the use of his
swollen legs, he had fallen greatly under the influence of his protégée,
whom he had at first kept strictly and in humble surroundings,
<q>on Lenten fare,</q> as the wits said at the time. But Grushenka
had succeeded in emancipating herself, while she established in him
a boundless belief in her fidelity. The old man, now long since
dead, had had a large business in his day and was also a noteworthy
character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenka's
hold upon him was so strong that he could not live without her (it
had been so especially for the last two years), he did not settle
any considerable fortune on her and would not have been moved
to do so, if she had threatened to leave him. But he had presented
<pb n='383'/><anchor id='Pg383'/>
her with a small sum, and even that was a surprise to every one
when it became known.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a wench with brains,</q> he said to her, when he gave her
eight thousand roubles, <q>and you must look after yourself, but let
me tell you that except your yearly allowance as before, you'll get
nothing more from me to the day of my death, and I'll leave you
nothing in my will either.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons,
whom, with their wives and children, he had treated all his life as
servants. Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this
became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice
to increase her capital and put business in her way.
</p>

<p>
When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka
over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by
falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was,
was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their
whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously
open with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person
in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had
come on the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On
the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of
advice.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you'd
better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel
will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But
don't keep on with the captain, you'll get no good out of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already
that his death was not far off and who actually died five months
later.
</p>

<p>
I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew
of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father
and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood
what really underlay her attitude to both of them. Even
Grushenka's two servants (after the catastrophe of which we will
speak later) testified in court that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch
simply from fear because <q>he threatened to murder her.</q> These
servants were an old cook, invalidish and almost deaf, who came
from Grushenka's old home, and her granddaughter, a smart young
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>
girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka
lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but
luxurious. Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany
furniture in the fashion of 1820, belonging to her landlady.
</p>

<p>
It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms,
yet they were not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her
drawing-room on the big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back.
The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather. Under her
head she had two white down pillows taken from her bed. She was
lying stretched out motionless on her back with her hands behind
her head. She was dressed as though expecting some one, in a black
silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which was very
becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with
a massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting some one. She
lay as though impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips
and eyes hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of
her right foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a
slight excitement. From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap
up from the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice, <q>Who's there?</q>
But the maid met the visitors and at once called back to her mistress.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not he, it's nothing, only other visitors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What can be the matter?</q> muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha
into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A
thick coil of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and
fell on her right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put
it back till she had gazed at her visitors and recognized them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, it's you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have
you brought? Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have
brought him!</q> she exclaimed, recognizing Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do send for candles!</q> said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air
of a most intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the
house.
</p>

<p>
<q>Candles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle....
Well, you have chosen a moment to bring him!</q> she exclaimed
again, nodding towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass
she began quickly fastening up her hair with both hands.
She seemed displeased.
</p>

<pb n='385'/><anchor id='Pg385'/>

<p>
<q>Haven't I managed to please you?</q> asked Rakitin, instantly
almost offended.
</p>

<p>
<q>You frightened me, Rakitin, that's what it is.</q> Grushenka turned
with a smile to Alyosha. <q>Don't be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha,
you cannot think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor.
But you frightened me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in.
You see, I deceived him just now, I made him promise to believe me
and I told him a lie. I told him that I was going to spend the evening
with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and should be there till
late counting up his money. I always spend one whole evening a
week with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in and
he counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down
in the book. I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that
I am there, but I came back and have been sitting locked in here,
expecting some news. How was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya,
run out to the gate, open it and look about whether the captain is
to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding and spying, I am dreadfully
frightened.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I've just looked
out, I keep running to peep through the crack, I am in fear and
trembling myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains&mdash;that's
better!</q> She drew the heavy curtains herself. <q>He'd
rush in at once if he saw a light. I am afraid of your brother
Mitya to-day, Alyosha.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed
very happy about something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?</q> inquired Rakitin. <q>I
should have thought you were not timid with him, you'd twist him
round your little finger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don't want
Mitya at all. And he didn't believe, I feel he didn't, that I should
stay at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. He must be in his ambush now, behind
Fyodor Pavlovitch's, in the garden, watching for me. And if he's
there, he won't come here, so much the better! But I really have
been to Kuzma Kuzmitch's, Mitya escorted me there. I told him I
should stay there till midnight, and I asked him to be sure to come
at midnight to fetch me home. He went away and I sat ten minutes
<pb n='386'/><anchor id='Pg386'/>
with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I was
afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you've
got on!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting
a message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away
and you will see no more of me. That's why I am dressed up, so as
to be ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where are you flying to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you know too much, you'll get old too soon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I've never seen
you like this before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a
ball.</q> Rakitin looked her up and down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Much you know about balls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you know much about them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch's son
was married and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I
want to be talking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing
here. Such a visitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you
and can't believe my eyes. Good heavens, can you have come here
to see me! To tell you the truth, I never had a thought of seeing
you and I didn't think that you would ever come and see me.
Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad to see you.
Sit down on the sofa, here, that's right, my bright young moon. I
really can't take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had
brought him yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is!
Perhaps it's better he has come now, at such a moment, and not the
day before yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
She gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him
with positive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying
when she said so. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a
good-hearted merry laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such
a kind expression in her face.... He had hardly met her till the
day before, he had formed an alarming idea of her, and had been
horribly distressed the day before by the spiteful and treacherous
trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. He was greatly surprised
to find her now altogether different from what he had expected.
And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes involuntarily
<pb n='387'/><anchor id='Pg387'/>
rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemed
changed for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace
of that mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness
in her movements. Everything was simple and good-natured,
her gestures were rapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly
excited.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!</q> she chattered
on again. <q>And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn't
say myself! If you ask me, I couldn't tell you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, don't you know why you're glad?</q> said Rakitin, grinning.
<q>You used to be always pestering me to bring him, you'd
some object, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had a different object once, but now that's over, this is not the
moment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good-natured
now. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing?
You've sat down already? There's no fear of Rakitin's forgetting
to look after himself. Look, Alyosha, he's sitting there opposite us,
so offended that I didn't ask him to sit down before you. Ugh,
Rakitin is such a one to take offense!</q> laughed Grushenka. <q>Don't
be angry, Rakitin, I'm kind to-day. Why are you so depressed,
Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped into his eyes with
merry mockery</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's sad. The promotion has not been given,</q> boomed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>What promotion?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His elder stinks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something
nasty. Be quiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha,
like this.</q> She suddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing,
on his knee, like a nestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck.
<q>I'll cheer you up, my pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit
on your knee? You won't be angry? If you tell me, I'll get off?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words,
<q>If you tell me, I'll get off,</q> but he did not answer. But there was
nothing in his heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him malignantly
from his corner, might have expected or fancied. The
great grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might
have been aroused, and, if only he could have thought clearly at that
moment, he would have realized that he had now the strongest
<pb n='388'/><anchor id='Pg388'/>
armor to protect him from every lust and temptation. Yet in spite
of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and the sorrow
that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new
and strange sensation in his heart. This woman, this <q>dreadful</q>
woman, had no terror for him now, none of that terror that had
stirred in his soul at any passing thought of woman. On the contrary,
this woman, dreaded above all women, sitting now on his
knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in him now a quite different,
unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the intensest and purest
interest without a trace of fear, of his former terror. That was
what instinctively surprised him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You've talked nonsense enough,</q> cried Rakitin, <q>you'd much
better give us some champagne. You owe it me, you know
you do!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne
on the top of everything, if he'd bring you? I'll have some
too! Fenya, Fenya, bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp!
Though I am so stingy, I'll stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin,
you're a toadstool, but he is a falcon! And though my heart is full
of something very different, so be it, I'll drink with you. I long for
some dissipation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what is the matter with you? And what is this message,
may I ask, or is it a secret?</q> Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his
best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually
aimed at him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ech, it's not a secret, and you know it, too,</q> Grushenka said,
in a voice suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and
drawing a little away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee
with her arm round his neck. <q>My officer is coming, Rakitin, my
officer is coming.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard he was coming, but is he so near?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is at Mokroe now; he'll send a messenger from there, so he
wrote; I got a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger
every minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't say so! Why at Mokroe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a long story, I've told you enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya'll be up to something now&mdash;I say! Does he know or
doesn't he?</q>
</p>

<pb n='389'/><anchor id='Pg389'/>

<p>
<q>He know! Of course he doesn't. If he knew, there would be
murder. But I am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his
knife. Be quiet, Rakitin, don't remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
he has bruised my heart. And I don't want to think of that at this
moment. I can think of Alyosha here, I can look at Alyosha ...
smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my foolishness, at my pleasure....
Ah, he's smiling, he's smiling! How kindly he looks at me!
And you know, Alyosha, I've been thinking all this time you were
angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because of that
young lady. I was a cur, that's the truth.... But it's a good thing
it happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.</q> Grushenka
smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile.
<q>Mitya told me that she screamed out that I <q>ought to be flogged.</q>
I did insult her dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a
conquest of me, to win me over with her chocolate.... No, it's
a good thing it did end like that.</q> She smiled again. <q>But I am
still afraid of your being angry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that's really true,</q> Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine
surprise. <q>Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you've no conscience,
that's what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul,
that's how it is! Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my
soul?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration,
Alexey!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what of it, I love him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what about your officer? And the priceless message from
Mokroe?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is quite different.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a woman's way of looking at it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't you make me angry, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka caught him
up hotly. <q>This is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different
way. It's true, Alyosha, I had sly designs on you before. For I
am a horrid, violent creature. But at other times I've looked upon
you, Alyosha, as my conscience. I've kept thinking <q>how any one
like that must despise a nasty thing like me.</q> I thought that the day
before yesterday, as I ran home from the young lady's. I have
thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya knows,
<pb n='390'/><anchor id='Pg390'/>
I've talked to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe
it, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed
of myself.... And how, and since when, I began to think about
