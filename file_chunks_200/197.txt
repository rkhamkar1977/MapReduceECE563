
<p>
<q>To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?</q> (Ippolit
Kirillovitch began.) <q>The first person who cried out that
Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at
the moment of his arrest, yet from that time to this he had not
brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest
suggestion of a fact. The charge is confirmed by three persons
only&mdash;the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The
elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to-day, when he
was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for
the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his
brother's guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of
that later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the
slightest fact to support his notion of Smerdyakov's guilt, and has
only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner's own words and
the expression of his face. Yes, that astounding piece of evidence
has been brought forward twice to-day by him. Madame Svyetlov
was even more astounding. <q>What the prisoner tells you, you must
believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.</q> That is all the evidence against
Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are all deeply
concerned in the prisoner's fate. And yet the theory of Smerdyakov's
guilt has been noised about, has been and is still maintained.
Is it credible? Is it conceivable?</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the
personality of Smerdyakov, <q>who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.</q>
He depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering
of education, who had been thrown off his balance by philosophical
ideas above his level and certain modern theories of duty,
which he learnt in practice from the reckless life of his master, who
was also perhaps his father&mdash;Fyodor Pavlovitch; and, theoretically,
from various strange philosophical conversations with his master's
elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily indulged in this diversion,
probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse himself at the valet's
expense. <q>He spoke to me himself of his spiritual condition during
<pb n='801'/><anchor id='Pg801'/>
the last few days at his father's house,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch explained;
<q rend='pre'>but others too have borne witness to it&mdash;the prisoner himself,
his brother, and the servant Grigory&mdash;that is, all who knew
him well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks
of epilepsy, had not the courage of a chicken. <q>He fell at my feet
and kissed them,</q> the prisoner himself has told us, before he realized
how damaging such a statement was to himself. <q>He is an epileptic
chicken,</q> he declared about him in his characteristic language. And
the prisoner chose him for his confidant (we have his own word for
it) and he frightened him into consenting at last to act as a spy
for him. In that capacity he deceived his master, revealing to the
prisoner the existence of the envelope with the notes in it and the
signals by means of which he could get into the house. How could
he help telling him, indeed? <q>He would have killed me, I could
see that he would have killed me,</q> he said at the inquiry, trembling
and shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time
arrested and could do him no harm. <q>He suspected me at every
instant. In fear and trembling I hastened to tell him every secret
to pacify him, that he might see that I had not deceived him and
let me off alive.</q> Those are his own words. I wrote them down and
I remember them. <q>When he began shouting at me, I would fall on
my knees.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence
of his master, ever since he had restored him some money he
had lost. So it may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs
of remorse at having deceived his master, whom he loved as his
benefactor. Persons severely afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most
skillful doctors tell us, always prone to continual and morbid self-reproach.
They worry over their <q>wickedness,</q> they are tormented
by pangs of conscience, often entirely without cause; they exaggerate
and often invent all sorts of faults and crimes. And here
we have a man of that type who had really been driven to wrong-doing
by terror and intimidation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible
would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before
his eyes. When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just
before the catastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though
<pb n='802'/><anchor id='Pg802'/>
he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared. He confined
himself to hints, but his hints were not understood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a
protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm
would come to pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov's
drunken letter, <q>I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.</q>
So Ivan Fyodorovitch's presence seemed to every one a guarantee of
peace and order in the house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But he went away, and within an hour of his young master's
departure Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that's
perfectly intelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed
by terror and despair of a sort, had felt during those last few
days that one of the fits from which he had suffered before at moments
of strain, might be coming upon him again. The day and
hour of such an attack cannot, of course, be foreseen, but every
epileptic can feel beforehand that he is likely to have one. So the
doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch had driven
out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his lonely and unprotected
position, went to the cellar. He went down the stairs wondering
if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to come
upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,
brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks,
and he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly
natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he
was shamming an attack <emph>on purpose</emph>. But, if it were on purpose,
the question arises at once, what was his motive? What was he
reckoning on? What was he aiming at? I say nothing about
medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the doctors were not
able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real. That
may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for
such a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder,
have desired to attract the attention of the household by having a
fit just before?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder,
there were five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch's&mdash;Fyodor Pavlovitch
himself (but he did not kill himself, that's evident); then his
servant, Grigory, but he was almost killed himself; the third person
was Grigory's wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, but it would be simply
<pb n='803'/><anchor id='Pg803'/>
shameful to imagine her murdering her master. Two persons are
left&mdash;the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are to believe the
prisoner's statement that he is not the murderer, then Smerdyakov
must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else can
be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation
against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday.
Had a shadow of suspicion rested on any one else, had there been
any sixth person, I am persuaded that even the prisoner would have
been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov, and would have accused that
sixth person, for to charge Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly
absurd.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine,
let us even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what
the facts tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it?
Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the
first alternative&mdash;that he did it alone. If he had killed him it must
have been with some object, for some advantage to himself. But not
having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder&mdash;hatred,
jealousy, and so on&mdash;Smerdyakov could only have murdered
him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the three
thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And
yet he tells another person&mdash;and a person most closely interested,
that is, the prisoner&mdash;everything about the money and the signals,
where the envelope lay, what was written on it, what it was tied
up with, and, above all, told him of those signals by which he could
enter the house. Did he do this simply to betray himself, or to
invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that
envelope for himself? <q>Yes,</q> I shall be told, <q>but he betrayed it
from fear.</q> But how do you explain this? A man who could conceive
such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells facts
which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held
his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a
crime, nothing would have induced him to tell any one about the
envelope and the signals, for that was as good as betraying himself
beforehand. He would have invented something, he would have
told some lie if he had been forced to give information, but he would
have been silent about that. For, on the other hand, if he had said
<pb n='804'/><anchor id='Pg804'/>
nothing about the money, but had committed the murder and stolen
the money, no one in the world could have charged him with murder
for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the money, no
one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had been
accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had
committed it from some other motive. But since no one had observed
any such motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on
the contrary, that his master was fond of him and honored him with
his confidence, he would, of course, have been the last to be suspected.
People would have suspected first the man who had a
motive, a man who had himself declared he had such motives, who
had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected the
son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov
killed and robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would,
of course, have suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that,
though plotting the murder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the
money, the envelope, and the signals? Is that logical? Is that
clear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we
have him falling downstairs in a <emph>feigned</emph> fit&mdash;with what object?
In the first place that Grigory, who had been intending to take his
medicine, might put it off and remain on guard, seeing there was no
one to look after the house, and, in the second place, I suppose, that
his master seeing that there was no one to guard him, and in terror
of a visit from his son, might redouble his vigilance and precaution.
And, most of all, I suppose that he, Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit,
might be carried from the kitchen, where he always slept, apart
from all the rest, and where he could go in and out as he liked, to
Grigory's room at the other end of the lodge, where he was always
put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This
was the immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted
Marfa Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying
behind the screen, he would most likely, to keep up the sham, have
begun groaning, and so keeping them awake all night (as Grigory
and his wife testified). And all this, we are to believe, that he might
more conveniently get up and murder his master!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he
might not be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money
<pb n='805'/><anchor id='Pg805'/>
and the signals to tempt him to commit the murder, and when he
had murdered him and had gone away with the money, making a
noise, most likely, and waking people, Smerdyakov got up, am I to
believe, and went in&mdash;what for? To murder his master a second
time and carry off the money that had already been stolen? Gentlemen,
are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions,
but, incredible as it seems, that's just what the prisoner alleges.
When he had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised
an alarm, he tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his
master and stole the money! I won't press the point that Smerdyakov
could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand, and have
foreseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to
peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, and beat a retreat,
leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put this
question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov
could have committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can't
accuse him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,
heard a shout, and went out. Well&mdash;what then? He
looked about him and said, <q>Why not go and kill the master?</q> And
how did he know what had happened, since he had been lying unconscious
till that moment? But there's a limit to these flights of
fancy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Quite so,</q> some astute people will tell me, <q>but what if they were
in agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared
the money&mdash;what then?</q> A weighty question, truly! And the facts
to confirm it are astounding. One commits the murder and takes
all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit,
apparently to arouse suspicion in every one, alarm in his master and
alarm in Grigory. It would be interesting to know what motives
could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane
plan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov's
part, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov
was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing
that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered,
without screaming for help or resisting, he may have obtained permission
from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming
<pb n='806'/><anchor id='Pg806'/>
a fit&mdash;<q>you may murder him as you like; it's nothing to me.</q> But
as this attack of Smerdyakov's was bound to throw the household
into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such
a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did
agree, it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer
and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and
not even an accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will
through terror.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly
throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of
being his accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. <q>He did
it alone,</q> he says. <q>He murdered and robbed him. It was the work
of his hands.</q> Strange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one
another at once! And think of the risk for Karamazov. After
committing the murder while his accomplice lay in bed, he throws
the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented it and in
self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he might
well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was
responsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were
punished, it would be far less severely than the real murderer. But
in that case he would have been certain to make a confession, yet
he has not done so. Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity,
though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him and declaring
that he had committed the crime alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>What's more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement
that it was <emph>he</emph> who had told the prisoner of the envelope of
notes and of the signals, and that, but for him, he would have known
nothing about them. If he had really been a guilty accomplice,
would he so readily have made this statement at the inquiry? On
the contrary, he would have tried to conceal it, to distort the facts
or minimize them. But he was far from distorting or minimizing
them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being
charged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit
of melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged
himself yesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language,
<q>I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no
blame on any one.</q> What would it have cost him to add: <q>I am
<pb n='807'/><anchor id='Pg807'/>
the murderer, not Karamazov</q>? But that he did not add. Did his
conscience lead him to suicide and not to avowing his guilt?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were
brought into the court just now, and we were told that they were
the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us, and
that the witness had received them from Smerdyakov the day before.
But I need not recall the painful scene, though I will make
one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones as might not be
obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be overlooked. In
the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money and
hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he
confessed his guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us.
If it were not so, indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept
silence till now? And so, if he has confessed, then why, I ask
again, did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left
behind, knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible
ordeal the next day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the
fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this
court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons
of five thousand each&mdash;that is, ten thousand in all&mdash;to the chief
town of the province to be changed. I only mention this to point
out that any one may have money, and that it can't be proved that
these notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch's envelope.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication
of such importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why
didn't he report it at once? Why did he put it all off till morning?
I think I have a right to conjecture why. His health had been
giving way for a week past: he had admitted to a doctor and to his
most intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and
seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on the eve of the attack of
brain fever by which he has been stricken down to-day. In this
condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov's death, and at once
reflected, <q>The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save
my brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that
Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.</q> You will say that
was dishonorable: it's dishonorable to slander even the dead, and
even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered him unconsciously?
<pb n='808'/><anchor id='Pg808'/>
What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the
valet's death, he imagined it really was so? You saw the recent
scene: you have seen the witness's condition. He was standing up
and was speaking, but where was his mind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Then followed the document, the prisoner's letter written two
days before the crime, and containing a complete program of the
murder. Why, then, are we looking for any other program? The
crime was committed precisely according to this program, and by
no other than the writer of it. Yes, gentlemen of the jury, it went
off without a hitch! He did not run respectfully and timidly away
from his father's window, though he was firmly convinced that the
object of his affections was with him. No, that is absurd and unlikely!
He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed him
in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated
rival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass
pestle, and having convinced himself, after careful search, that she
was not there, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the
pillow and take out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now
on the table before us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very
characteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer
and had he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would
he have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside
the corpse? Had it been Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his
master to rob him, he would have simply carried away the envelope
with him, without troubling himself to open it over his victim's
corpse, for he would have known for certain that the notes were in
the envelope&mdash;they had been put in and sealed up in his presence&mdash;and
had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have
known of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov
have behaved in that way? Would he have left the envelope on
the floor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who
was not a thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched
the notes from under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but
as though seizing his own property from the thief who had stolen it.
For that was the idea which had become almost an insane obsession
in Dmitri Karamazov in regard to that money. And pouncing
<pb n='809'/><anchor id='Pg809'/>
upon the envelope, which he had never seen before, he tore it open
to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran away with the
money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had left
an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope
on the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he
didn't think, he didn't reflect, and how should he? He ran away;
he heard behind him the servant cry out; the old man caught him,
stopped him and was felled to the ground by the brass pestle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would
you believe it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion,
to see whether he could do anything for him. Was that a
moment to show compassion? No; he jumped down simply to
make certain whether the only witness of his crime were dead or
alive. Any other feeling, any other motive would be unnatural.
Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wiped his head with his
handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran to the
house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it
he never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at
once detected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not
even notice that he was covered with blood. That may be believed,
that is very possible, that always happens at such moments with
criminals. On one point they will show diabolical cunning, while
another will escape them altogether. But he was thinking at that
moment of one thing only&mdash;where was <emph>she</emph>? He wanted to find out
at once where she was, so he ran to her lodging and learnt an unexpected
and astounding piece of news&mdash;she had gone off to Mokroe
to meet her first lover.</q>

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor's Speech.</head>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of
exposition, beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation
a check on their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his
<pb n='810'/><anchor id='Pg810'/>
speech he went off into a dissertation on Grushenka's <q>first lover,</q>
and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed,
so to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first
lover. What makes it all the more strange is that he seems to have
hardly thought of this formidable rival. But he had looked upon
him as a remote danger, and Karamazov always lives in the present.
Possibly he regarded him as a fiction. But his wounded heart grasped
instantly that the woman had been concealing this new rival and
deceiving him, because he was anything but a fiction to her, because
he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this instantly, he
resigned himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected
trait in the prisoner's character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible
desire for justice, a respect for woman and a recognition
of her right to love. And all this at the very moment when he had
stained his hands with his father's blood for her sake! It is true
that the blood he had shed was already crying out for vengeance,
for, after having ruined his soul and his life in this world, he was
forced to ask himself at that same instant what he was and what
he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him than his own
soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned penitent,
with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with
honorable offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life.
And he, luckless man, what could he give her now, what could he
offer her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him
by his crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a
man with life before him! This thought crushed him. And so he
instantly flew to one frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's
character, must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his
terrible position. That way out was suicide. He ran for the pistols
he had left in pledge with his friend Perhotin and on the way, as
he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money, for the sake of which
he had stained his hands with his father's gore. Oh, now he needed
money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would
shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a
poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. <q>To her, to
<pb n='811'/><anchor id='Pg811'/>
her! and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such
as never was before, that will be remembered and talked of long
after! In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy
songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I
adore and her new-found happiness! And then, on the spot, at her
feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She
will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya
loved her, she will feel for Mitya!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and
sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes,
but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that
cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the
heart unto death&mdash;that <emph>something</emph> is conscience, gentlemen of the
jury, its judgment, its terrible torments! The pistol will settle
everything, the pistol is the only way out! But <emph>beyond</emph>&mdash;I don't
know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment <q>What lies
beyond,</q> and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder <q>What
lies beyond.</q> No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets,
but we still have our Karamazovs!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's preparations,
the scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the drivers. He
quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and
the picture made a terrible impression on the audience. The guilt
of this harassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing,
when the facts were brought together.
</p>

<p>
<q>What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost
confessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out.</q> (Then followed the
evidence given by witnesses.) <q rend='pre'>He even cried out to the peasant
who drove him, <q>Do you know, you are driving a murderer!</q> But
it was impossible for him to speak out, he had to get to Mokroe and
there to finish his romance. But what was awaiting the luckless
man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw that his invincible
rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the toast
to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be
acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from
the preliminary inquiry. Karamazov's triumph over his rival was
complete and his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most
terrible phase through which his soul has passed or will pass.</q>
</p>

<pb n='812'/><anchor id='Pg812'/>

<p>
<q>One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,</q> the prosecutor
continued, <q rend='pre'>that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring
their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice.
What's more, justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate
the punishment of nature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of
the criminal at such moments, as its salvation from despair. For I
cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when
he learnt that she loved him, that for his sake she had rejected her
first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya, to a new life, that
she was promising him happiness&mdash;and when? When everything
was over for him and nothing was possible!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for
the light it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment. This
woman, this love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very
instant of his arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by
him but unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why
did he relinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was?
It was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying
it that restrained him. Throughout their revels he kept close to
his adored mistress, who was at the banquet with him and was more
charming and fascinating to him than ever&mdash;he did not leave her
side, abasing himself in his homage before her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear
of arrest, but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh,
only for a moment! I can picture the state of mind of the criminal
hopelessly enslaved by these influences&mdash;first, the influence of drink,
of noise and excitement, of the thud of the dance and the scream
of the song, and of her, flushed with wine, singing and dancing and
laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in the background that the
fatal end might still be far off, that not till next morning, at least,
they would come and take him. So he had a few hours and that's
much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many things.
I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when they
are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street
to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then
there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of
that street the dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning
of the journey the condemned man, sitting on his shameful
<pb n='813'/><anchor id='Pg813'/>
cart, must feel that he has infinite life still before him. The houses
recede, the cart moves on&mdash;oh, that's nothing, it's still far to the
turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and
to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes
fixed on him, and he still fancies that he is just such a man as they.
But now the turning comes to the next street. Oh, that's nothing,
nothing, there's still a whole street before him, and however many
houses have been passed, he will still think there are many left.
And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. <q>They've
not had time yet,</q> he must have thought, <q>I may still find some way
out, oh, there's still time to make some plan of defense, and now,
now&mdash;she is so fascinating!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however,
to put aside half his money and hide it somewhere&mdash;I cannot
otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand
he had just taken from his father's pillow. He had been in
Mokroe more than once before, he had caroused there for two days
together already, he knew the old big house with all its passages and
outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money was hidden in that
house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice, under some floor,
in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I shall be
asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he
hadn't yet considered how to meet it, he hadn't the time, his head
was throbbing and his heart was with <emph>her</emph>, but money&mdash;money was
indispensable in any case! With money a man is always a man.
Perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as unnatural?
But he assures us himself that a month before, at a critical
and exciting moment, he had halved his money and sewn it up in a
little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall prove directly,
it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had
contemplated it. What's more, when he declared at the inquiry
that he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never
existed) he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of
the moment, because he had two hours before divided his money and
hidden half of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency, simply
not to have it on himself. Two extremes, gentlemen of the
<pb n='814'/><anchor id='Pg814'/>
jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate two extremes and
both at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money.
It may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be
in the prisoner's hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his
knees before her, she was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched
out to her and he had so entirely forgotten everything that he did
not even hear the men coming to arrest him. He hadn't time to
prepare any line of defense in his mind. He was caught unawares
and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his destiny.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of
our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his
account, too! The moments of contemplating that animal fear,
when the criminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still means
to struggle, the moments when every instinct of self-preservation
rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and
suffering eyes, studies you, your face, your thoughts, uncertain on
which side you will strike, and his distracted mind frames thousands
of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to speak, afraid of giving
himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for
self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the human soul, are
awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal
even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some
very compromising phrases. <q>Blood! I've deserved it!</q> But he
quickly restrained himself. He had not prepared what he was to
say, what answer he was to make, he had nothing but a bare denial
ready. <q>I am not guilty of my father's death.</q> That was his fence
for the moment and behind it he hoped to throw up a barricade of
some sort. His first compromising exclamations he hastened to
explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death of the
servant Grigory only. <q>Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has
killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have
killed him, <emph>if not I</emph>?</q> Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had
come to ask him that question! Do you hear that phrase uttered
with such premature haste&mdash;<q>if not I</q>&mdash;the animal cunning, the naïveté,
the Karamazov impatience of it? <q>I didn't kill him and you
mustn't think I did! I wanted to kill him, gentlemen, I wanted
<pb n='815'/><anchor id='Pg815'/>
to kill him,</q> he hastens to admit (he was in a hurry, in a terrible
hurry), <q>but still I am not guilty, it is not I murdered him.</q> He
concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though to say, you
can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you'll believe all the
sooner that I didn't murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is
often amazingly shallow and credulous.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally,
the most simple question, <q>Wasn't it Smerdyakov killed
him?</q> Then, as we expected, he was horribly angry at our having
anticipated him and caught him unawares, before he had time to
pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be
most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name. He rushed at once
to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to assure us that
Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of it. But
don't believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn't really give
up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him
forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but
he would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled
for him. He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a
few days later, choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, <q>You know
I was more skeptical about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that
yourselves, but now I am convinced. He killed him, he must have
done!</q> And for the present he falls back upon a gloomy and irritable
denial. Impatience and anger prompted him, however, to the
most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked into his
father's window and how he respectfully withdrew. The worst of
it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the evidence
given by Grigory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged
him, the whole three thousand had not been found on him,
only half of it. And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence,
the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him. No doubt he was
conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully
to make it sound more likely, to weave it into a romance that
would sound plausible. In such cases the first duty, the chief task
of the investigating lawyers, is to prevent the criminal being prepared,
to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out
his cherished ideas in all their simplicity, improbability and inconsistency.
<pb n='816'/><anchor id='Pg816'/>
The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and
apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of some circumstance
of great importance in the case, of which he had no previous
idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in
readiness&mdash;that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through
which the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about
that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have
seen it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us,
<q>Then Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!</q> and so
betrayed the basis of the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed
it in its most improbable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have
committed the murder after he had knocked Grigory down and run
away. When we told him that Grigory saw the door was open
before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as
he came out of his bedroom&mdash;Karamazov was positively crushed. My
esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards
that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And
to improve matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of
little bag&mdash;so be it, you shall hear this romance!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider
this romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention
that could have been brought forward in the circumstances. If
one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could
hardly find anything more incredible. The worst of such stories is
that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and
crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which
these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers neglect as insignificant
trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details, their
minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and
fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that's how
they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, <q>Where did
you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?</q> <q>I
made it myself.</q> <q>And where did you get the linen?</q> The prisoner
was positively offended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him
such a trivial question, and would you believe it, his resentment was
genuine! But they are all like that. <q>I tore it off my shirt.</q> <q>Then
we shall find that shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece
<pb n='817'/><anchor id='Pg817'/>
torn off.</q> And only fancy, gentlemen of the jury, if we really had
found that torn shirt (and how could we have failed to find it in his
chest of drawers or trunk?) that would have been a fact, a material
fact in support of his statement! But he was incapable of that reflection.
<q>I don't remember, it may not have been off my shirt, I
sewed it up in one of my landlady's caps.</q> <q>What sort of a cap?</q> <q>It
was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.</q> <q>And do you remember
that clearly?</q> <q>No, I don't.</q> And he was angry, very angry, and
yet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments
of man's life, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers
just such trifles. He will forget anything but some green
roof that has flashed past him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross&mdash;that
he will remember. He concealed the making of that little
bag from his household, he must have remembered his humiliating
fear that some one might come in and find him needle in hand, how
at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen (there is a screen
in his lodgings).</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these
details, trifles?</q> cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. <q>Just because
the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He
has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago,
he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic
statements; all those are trivialities. <q>You must believe it on my
honor.</q> Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are eager to believe it,
even if only on his word of honor! Are we jackals thirsting for
human blood? Show us a single fact in the prisoner's favor and we
shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion
drawn from the prisoner's expression by his own brother, or that
when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to
the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new fact,
we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to
repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot
repudiate anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as
though he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance,
the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base
motive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency
of the facts.
</p>

<pb n='818'/><anchor id='Pg818'/>

<p>
<q>And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated
counsel for the defense,</q> Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding,
<q>whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities,
remember that at this moment you are in a temple of
justice. Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the
champions of our holy Russia, of her principles, her family, everything
that she holds sacred! Yes, you represent Russia here at this
moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but
will reëcho throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia will
hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be encouraged
or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and her
expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps
to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched
out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course.
And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not
from respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from
horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that
they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so and
will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will
check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own
safety, enlightenment and civilization. Already we have heard
voices of alarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not
tempt them! Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence
justifying the murder of a father by his son!</q>
</p>

<p>
Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up
his speech with this rhetorical appeal&mdash;and the effect produced by
him was extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went
out hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the
adjoining room. There was no applause in the court, but serious
persons were pleased. The ladies were not so well satisfied, though
even they were pleased with his eloquence, especially as they had no
apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in
Fetyukovitch. <q>He will speak at last and of course carry all before
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the
prosecutor's speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and
his head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and
listened, especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the
<pb n='819'/><anchor id='Pg819'/>
prosecutor mentioned Rakitin's opinion of her, a smile of contempt
and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly,
<q>The Bernards!</q> When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had
questioned and tortured him at Mokroe, Mitya raised his head and
listened with intense curiosity. At one point he seemed about to
jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his
shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end of the
speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe,
and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. <q>The man could not resist boasting
of his cleverness,</q> they said.
</p>

<p>
The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter
of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation
and exclamations in the audience. I remember some of
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>A weighty speech,</q> a gentleman in one group observed gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>He brought in too much psychology,</q> said another voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>But it was all true, the absolute truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he is first rate at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He summed it all up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he summed us up, too,</q> chimed in another voice. <q>Do you
remember, at the beginning of his speech, making out we were all
like Fyodor Pavlovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And at the end, too. But that was all rot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And obscure too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He was a little too much carried away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's unjust, it's unjust.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it was smartly done, anyway. He's had long to wait, but
he's had his say, ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What will the counsel for the defense say?</q>
</p>

<p>
In another group I heard:
</p>

<p>
<q>He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like
that; <q>appealing to your sensibilities</q>&mdash;do you remember?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that was awkward of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He was in too great a hurry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a nervous man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what must it be for Mitya?</q>
</p>

<p>
In a third group:
</p>

<pb n='820'/><anchor id='Pg820'/>

<p>
<q>What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the
end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a general's wife, divorced, I know her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's why she has the lorgnette.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is not good for much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is
prettier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn't they, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, it was smart enough. We've heard it before, how often he
has told the story at people's houses!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And he couldn't resist doing it now. That's vanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a man with a grievance, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much
rhetoric, such long sentences.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you
remember about the troika? Something about <q>They have Hamlets,
but we have, so far, only Karamazovs!</q> That was cleverly said!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatever he says, he won't get round our peasants.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't you think so?</q>
</p>

<p>
A fourth group:
</p>

<p>
<q>What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the
other nations.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And that was true what he said about other nations not standing
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and
speaking about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not
high time to intervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was
thinking of him, I know he was. He was talking about that last
week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not an easy job.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not an easy job? Why not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, we'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn.
Where would they get it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='821'/><anchor id='Pg821'/>

<p>
<q>In America. They get it from America now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense!</q>
</p>

<p>
But the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch
mounted the tribune.

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways</head>

<p>
All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out.
The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began
very simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the
slightest trace of conceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at
pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a man speaking in a circle
of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice was a fine one,
sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine and
simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that
the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and <q>pierce the
heart with untold power.</q> His language was perhaps more irregular
than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he spoke without long phrases, and
indeed, with more precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he
kept bending forward, especially at the beginning of his speech, not
exactly bowing, but as though he were about to dart at his listeners,
bending his long spine in half, as though there were a spring in the
middle that enabled him to bend almost at right angles.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly,
without system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though,
at the end, these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided
into two parts, the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the
charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half
he suddenly changed his tone, and even his manner, and at once
rose to pathos. The audience seemed on the look-out for it, and
quivered with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although
he practiced in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial
towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or
<pb n='822'/><anchor id='Pg822'/>
at least a preconceived idea. <q>That is what has happened to me in
the present case,</q> he explained. <q>From the very first accounts in
the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed
me in the prisoner's favor. What interested me most was a
fact which often occurs in legal practice, but rarely, I think, in such
an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case. I ought to
formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech, but I will
do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to work
directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my material.
That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it's sincere.
What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of
evidence against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that
will stand criticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the
case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed,
and I suddenly received from the prisoner's relatives a request
to undertake his defense. I at once hurried here, and here I
became completely convinced. It was to break down this terrible
chain of facts, and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately
was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the case.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Fetyukovitch began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> he suddenly protested, <q>I am new to this
district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of
turbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has
insulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced
many people against him beforehand. Of course I recognize that
the moral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him.
The prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper. Yet he was received
in society here; he was even welcome in the family of my
talented friend, the prosecutor.</q>
</p>

<p>
(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,
quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that
the prosecutor received Mitya against his will, solely because he had
somehow interested his wife&mdash;a lady of the highest virtue and moral
worth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her husband,
especially in trifles. Mitya's visits, however, had not been frequent.)
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I venture to suggest,</q> Fetyukovitch continued,
<q>that in spite of his independent mind and just character, my
opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate
<pb n='823'/><anchor id='Pg823'/>
client. Oh, that is so natural; the unfortunate man has only
too well deserved such prejudice. Outraged morality, and still more
outraged taste, is often relentless. We have, in the talented prosecutor's
speech, heard a stern analysis of the prisoner's character and
conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the case was evident.
And, what's more, he went into psychological subtleties into which
he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and malicious
prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are
even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious
and consciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away
by the artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a
romance, especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight.
Before I started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg,
and was myself aware, that I should find here a talented opponent
whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained him peculiar
renown in legal circles of recent years. But profound as psychology
is, it's a knife that cuts both ways.</q> (Laughter among the public.)
<q rend='pre'>You will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can't boast of eloquence.
But I will take as an example any point in the prosecutor's
speech.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed
over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down
with a brass pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent
five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he had killed
him or not. And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's
statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity. <q>No,</q> he says,
<q>such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that's unnatural;
he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead
or alive, and so showed that he had committed the murder, since he
would not have run back for any other reason.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method
and apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be
no less probable. The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out,
as a precaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he had left
in his murdered father's study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an
amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope, with an
inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it. <q>If he
had carried that envelope away with him, no one in the world would
<pb n='824'/><anchor id='Pg824'/>
have known of that envelope and of the notes in it, and that the
money had been stolen by the prisoner.</q> Those are the prosecutor's
own words. So on one side you see a complete absence of precaution,
a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright, leaving that
clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed another
man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating
foresight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological
subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances
I become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle,
while at the next I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so
bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only
run back to find out whether he is alive to witness against me, why
should I spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk
of encountering other witnesses? Why soak my handkerchief, wiping
the blood off his head so that it may be evidence against me
later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why not hit the
servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill
him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he
left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had
taken from the two women, and which they could always recognize
afterwards as theirs, and prove that he had taken it from them.
And it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it
through carelessness or haste, no, he had flung away his weapon, for
it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay. Why did he do
so? Just because he was grieved at having killed a man, an old
servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous
weapon. That's how it must have been, what other reason could he
have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling
grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent
of his father's murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have
run to another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently;
his thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation.
He would have had none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt.
On the contrary, he would have broken his skull instead of spending
five minutes looking after him. There was room for pity and good-feeling
just because his conscience had been clear till then. Here
we have a different psychology. I have purposely resorted to this
<pb n='825'/><anchor id='Pg825'/>
method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything
by it. It all depends on who makes use of it. Psychology
lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously.
I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor,
were again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in
detail; I will only quote some passages from it, some leading points.

<head>Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery</head>

<p>
There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch's
speech. He flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand
roubles, and consequently, the possibility of their having been
stolen.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen of the jury,</q> he began. <q rend='pre'>Every new and unprejudiced
observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the
present case, namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility
of proving that there was anything to be stolen. We are
told that money was stolen&mdash;three thousand roubles&mdash;but whether
those roubles ever existed, nobody knows. Consider, how have we
heard of that sum, and who has seen the notes? The only person
who saw them, and stated that they had been put in the envelope,
was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the prisoner
and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe. Madame
Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three persons
had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and that
Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time?
What if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put
them back in his cash-box without telling him? Note, that according
to Smerdyakov's story the notes were kept under the mattress;
the prisoner must have pulled them out, and yet the bed was absolutely
unrumpled; that is carefully recorded in the protocol. How
could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the
<pb n='826'/><anchor id='Pg826'/>
bed? How could he have helped soiling with his blood-stained hands
the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely
made?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes,
it's worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat
surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor
declare of himself&mdash;of himself, observe&mdash;that but for that envelope,
