you like that, I can't say, I don't remember....</q>
</p>

<p>
Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three
glasses of champagne on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here's the champagne!</q> cried Rakitin. <q>You're excited, Agrafena
Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When you've had a glass of
champagne, you'll be ready to dance. Eh, they can't even do that
properly,</q> he added, looking at the bottle. <q>The old woman's
poured it out in the kitchen and the bottle's been brought in warm
and without a cork. Well, let me have some, anyway.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp
and poured himself out another.
</p>

<p>
<q>One doesn't often stumble upon champagne,</q> he said, licking
his lips. <q>Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do!
What shall we drink to? The gates of paradise? Take a glass,
Grushenka, you drink to the gates of paradise, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What gates of paradise?</q>
</p>

<p>
She took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I'd better not,</q> he smiled gently.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you bragged!</q> cried Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, if so, I won't either,</q> chimed in Grushenka, <q>I really
don't want any. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin.
If Alyosha has some, I will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What touching sentimentality!</q> said Rakitin tauntingly; <q>and
she's sitting on his knee, too! He's got something to grieve over,
but what's the matter with you? He is rebelling against his God
and ready to eat sausage....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His elder died to-day, Father Zossima, the saint.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So Father Zossima is dead,</q> cried Grushenka. <q>Good God, I
did not know!</q> She crossed herself devoutly. <q>Goodness, what
have I been doing, sitting on his knee like this at such a moment!</q>
She started up as though in dismay, instantly slipped off his knee
and sat down on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed
to dawn in his face.
</p>

<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>

<p>
<q>Rakitin,</q> he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; <q>don't
taunt me with having rebelled against God. I don't want to feel
angry with you, so you must be kinder, too, I've lost a treasure
such as you have never had, and you cannot judge me now. You
had much better look at her&mdash;do you see how she has pity on me?
I came here to find a wicked soul&mdash;I felt drawn to evil because I
was base and evil myself, and I've found a true sister, I have found
a treasure&mdash;a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....
Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You've raised my
soul from the depths.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha's lips were quivering and he caught his breath.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has saved you, it seems,</q> laughed Rakitin spitefully. <q>And
she meant to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka jumped up. <q>Hush, both of you.
Now I'll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make
me ashamed, for I am bad and not good&mdash;that's what I am. And
you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea
of trying to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it's
all different. And don't let me hear anything more from you,
Rakitin.</q>
</p>

<p>
All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are both crazy,</q> said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement.
<q>I feel as though I were in a madhouse. They're both getting
so feeble they'll begin crying in a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall begin to cry, I shall,</q> repeated Grushenka. <q>He called
me his sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you,
Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and
annoyed, though he might have reflected that each of them was just
passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a
lifetime. But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything
that concerned himself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings
and sensations of others&mdash;partly from his youth and inexperience,
partly from his intense egoism.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, Alyosha,</q> Grushenka turned to him with a nervous
laugh. <q>I was boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an
onion, but it's not to boast I tell you about it. It's only a story, but
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
it's a nice story. I used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona,
my cook, who is still with me. It's like this. Once upon a time
there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she was. And
she died and did not leave a single good deed behind. The devils
caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire. So her guardian
angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember
to tell to God; <q>She once pulled up an onion in her garden,</q> said
he, <q>and gave it to a beggar woman.</q> And God answered: <q>You take
that onion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold
and be pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her
come to Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must
stay where she is.</q> The angel ran to the woman and held out the
onion to her. <q>Come,</q> said he, <q>catch hold and I'll pull you out.</q>
And he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her
right out, when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was
being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled
out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began
kicking them. <q>I'm to be pulled out, not you. It's my onion, not
yours.</q> As soon as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman
fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day. So the angel
wept and went away. So that's the story, Alyosha; I know it by
heart, for I am that wicked woman myself. I boasted to Rakitin
that I had given away an onion, but to you I'll say: <q>I've done
nothing but give away one onion all my life, that's the only good
deed I've done.</q> So don't praise me, Alyosha, don't think me good,
I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you
praise me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was
so anxious to get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five
roubles if he would bring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!</q>
</p>

<p>
She went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled
out a purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.
</p>

<p>
<q>What nonsense! What nonsense!</q> cried Rakitin, disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there's no fear of your refusing
it, you asked for it yourself.</q> And she threw the note to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Likely I should refuse it,</q> boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed,
but carrying off his confusion with a swagger. <q>That will come in
very handy; fools are made for wise men's profit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say
<pb n='393'/><anchor id='Pg393'/>
now is not for your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet.
You don't like us, so hold your tongue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I like you for?</q> Rakitin snarled, not concealing
his ill-humor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket
and he felt ashamed at Alyosha's seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving
his payment later, without Alyosha's knowing of it, and
now, feeling ashamed, he lost his temper. Till that moment he had
thought it discreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite
of her snubbing, since he had something to get out of her. But
now he, too, was angry:
</p>

<p>
<q>One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you
done for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make
such a fuss about it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke
with heat and there were hysterical notes in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don't dare to
speak to me like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in
that corner and be quiet, as though you were my footman! And
now, Alyosha, I'll tell you the whole truth, that you may see what
a wretch I am! I am not talking to Rakitin, but to you. I wanted
to ruin you, Alyosha, that's the holy truth; I quite meant to. I
wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you. And why
did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,
you turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes.
And I've looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking
every one about you. Your face haunted my heart. <q>He despises
me,</q> I thought; <q>he won't even look at me.</q> And I felt it so
much at last that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a
boy. I'll get him in my clutches and laugh at him. I was full of
spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody here dares talk or
think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose.
Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was
bound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has
been no one else. But looking at you, I thought, I'll get him in
my clutches and laugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am,
and you called me your sister! And now that man who wronged
<pb n='394'/><anchor id='Pg394'/>
me has come; I sit here waiting for a message from him. And do
you know what that man has been to me? Five years ago, when
Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one
might have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used
to sit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: <q>Where
is he now, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with
another woman, most likely. If only I could see him, if I could
meet him again, I'd pay him out, I'd pay him out!</q> At night I
used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the dark, and I used to brood
over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose and gloat over my anger.
<q>I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!</q> That's what I used to cry out
in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should really do
nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhaps
had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into
helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I
would get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole
world to pieces. And then what do you think? I began saving
money, I became hard-hearted, grew stout&mdash;grew wiser, would you
say? No, no one in the whole world sees it, no one knows it, but
when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did five years ago, when
I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all night, thinking,
<q>I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!</q> Do you hear? Well then, now
you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me&mdash;he was
coming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath
away; then I suddenly thought: <q>If he comes and whistles to call me,
I shall creep back to him like a beaten dog.</q> I couldn't believe myself.
Am I so abject? Shall I run to him or not? And I've been
in such a rage with myself all this month that I am worse than I
was five years ago. Do you see now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive
creature I am? I have shown you the whole truth! I played
with Mitya to keep me from running to that other. Hush, Rakitin,
it's not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to you. Before you
came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole
future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,
Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened
the day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world
knows what I am going through now, and no one ever can know....
<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>
For perhaps I shall take a knife with me to-day, I can't make
up my mind ...</q>
</p>

<p>
And at this <q>tragic</q> phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face
in her hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a
little child.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Misha,</q> he said, <q>don't be angry. She wounded you, but don't
be angry. You heard what she said just now? You mustn't ask
too much of human endurance, one must be merciful.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He
felt obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not
been there, he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked
at him ironically and Alyosha stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>You were so primed up with your elder's teaching last night
that now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!</q> said
Rakitin, with a smile of hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't laugh, Rakitin, don't smile, don't talk of the dead&mdash;he
was better than any one in the world!</q> cried Alyosha, with tears in
his voice. <q>I didn't speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the
judged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and
said to myself, <q>What does it matter?</q> in my cowardliness, but she,
after five years in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the
heart to her&mdash;it makes her forget everything, forgive everything, in
her tears! The man who has wronged her has come back, he sends
for her and she forgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to
meet him and she won't take a knife with her. She won't! No, I
am not like that. I don't know whether you are, Misha, but I am
not like that. It's a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....
Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us?
No, you haven't; if you had, you'd have understood her long ago ...
and the person insulted the day before yesterday must forgive
her, too! She will, when she knows ... and she shall know....
This soul is not yet at peace with itself, one must be tender with it ...
there may be a treasure in that soul....</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his
ill-humor Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never
expected such a tirade from the gentle Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love
<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>
with her? Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk's really in love with
you, you've made a conquest!</q> he cried, with a coarse laugh.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha
with a tender smile shining on her tear-stained face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not
a person for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,</q> she turned to
Rakitin, <q>I meant to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but
now I don't want to. Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.</q> She
beckoned to him with a happy smile. <q>That's right, sit here. Tell
me,</q> she shook him by the hand and peeped into his face, smiling,
<q>tell me, do I love that man or not? the man who wronged me, do
I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here in the dark, asking
my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the time
has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have forgiven him already,</q> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I really have forgiven him,</q> Grushenka murmured thoughtfully.
<q>What an abject heart! To my abject heart!</q> She snatched
up a glass from the table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air
and flung it on the floor. The glass broke with a crash. A little
cruel line came into her smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps I haven't forgiven him, though,</q> she said, with a sort of
menace in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as
though she were talking to herself. <q>Perhaps my heart is only getting
ready to forgive. I shall struggle with my heart. You see,
Alyosha, I've grown to love my tears in these five years....
Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I shouldn't care to be in his shoes,</q> hissed Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you won't be, Rakitin, you'll never be in his shoes. You
shall black my shoes, Rakitin, that's the place you are fit for. You'll
never get a woman like me ... and he won't either, perhaps ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Won't he? Then why are you dressed up like that?</q> said Rakitin,
with a venomous sneer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don't know all
that is in my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I'll tear it off
at once, this minute,</q> she cried in a resonant voice. <q>You don't
know what that finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and
say: <q>Have you ever seen me look like this before?</q> He left me a
thin, consumptive cry-baby of seventeen. I'll sit by him, fascinate
<pb n='397'/><anchor id='Pg397'/>
him and work him up. <q>Do you see what I am like now?</q> I'll say
to him; <q>well, and that's enough for you, my dear sir, there's many
a slip twixt the cup and the lip!</q> That may be what the finery is
for, Rakitin.</q> Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh. <q>I'm
violent and resentful, Alyosha, I'll tear off my finery, I'll destroy
my beauty, I'll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn
beggar. If I choose, I won't go anywhere now to see any one. If I
choose, I'll send Kuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow,
and all his money and I'll go out charing for the rest of my life.
You think I wouldn't do it, Rakitin, that I would not dare to do it?
I would, I would, I could do it directly, only don't exasperate me ...
and I'll send him about his business, I'll snap my fingers
in his face, he shall never see me again!</q>
</p>

<p>
She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke
down again, hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and
shook with sobs.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's time we were off,</q> he said, <q>it's late, we shall be shut out of
the monastery.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka leapt up from her place.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha!</q> she cried, in mournful
surprise. <q>What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling,
tortured me, and now you'll leave me to face this night alone!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants
to, let him! I'll go alone,</q> Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, evil tongue!</q> Grushenka cried angrily at him; <q>you never
said such words to me as he has come to say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What has he said to you so special?</q> asked Rakitin irritably.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he said to me,
it went straight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the
first, the only one who has pitied me, that's what it is. Why did
you not come before, you angel?</q> She fell on her knees before him
as though in a sudden frenzy. <q>I've been waiting all my life for
some one like you, I knew that some one like you would come and
forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, some one would really
love me, not only with a shameful love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I done to you?</q> answered Alyosha, bending over
her with a tender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; <q>I
<pb n='398'/><anchor id='Pg398'/>
only gave you an onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was
all!</q>
</p>

<p>
He was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment
there was a sudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall.
Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily
into the room, crying out:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,</q> she cried,
breathless and joyful. <q>A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey
the driver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses....
A letter, here's the letter, mistress.</q>
</p>

<p>
A letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while
she talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it
to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one
instant.
</p>

<p>
<q>He has sent for me,</q> she cried, her face white and distorted,
with a wan smile; <q>he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!</q>
</p>

<p>
But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly
the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go,</q> she cried; <q>five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by,
Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don't
let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don't
you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to
my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!</q>
</p>

<p>
She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, she has no thoughts for us now!</q> grumbled Rakitin.
<q>Let's go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick
of all these tears and cries.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood
a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were
running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being
led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the
bottom of the steps, Grushenka's bedroom window was suddenly
opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha:
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him
not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery.
And tell him, too, in my words: <q>Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel,
and not to you, noble heart.</q> And add, too, that Grushenka
loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him&mdash;so let
<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>
him remember that hour all his life&mdash;say, <q>Grushenka tells you to!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a
slam.
</p>

<p>
<q>H'm, h'm!</q> growled Rakitin, laughing, <q>she murders your
brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life! What
ferocity!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked
fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in
thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as
though he had been touched on an open wound. He had expected
something quite different by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha together.
Something very different from what he had hoped for had
happened.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a Pole, that officer of hers,</q> he began again, restraining
himself; <q>and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in
the customs in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some
puny little beggar of a Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He's
heard now that Grushenka's saved a little money, so he's turned up
again&mdash;that's the explanation of the mystery.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, so you've saved the sinner?</q> he laughed spitefully. <q>Have
you turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the
seven devils, eh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for
just now have come to pass!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush, Rakitin,</q> Alyosha answered with an aching heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've sold
my friend, you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am
not Judas.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it,</q> cried Alyosha,
<q>you remind me of it yourself....</q>
</p>

<p>
But this was the last straw for Rakitin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation take you all and each of you!</q> he cried suddenly,
<q>why the devil did I take you up? I don't want to know you from
this time forward. Go alone, there's your road!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha
alone in the dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked
across the fields to the monastery.

<head>Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee</head>

<p>
It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha
returned to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a
special entrance. It had struck nine o'clock&mdash;the hour of rest and
repose after a day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly
opened the door and went into the elder's cell where his coffin was
now standing. There was no one in the cell but Father Païssy,
reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice
Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's conversation and
the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep sound
sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father
Païssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.
Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his
knees and began to pray.
</p>

<p>
His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single
sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another
in a slow, continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart
and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw
that coffin before him, the hidden dead figure so precious to him,
but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning was no longer
aching in his soul. As soon as he came in, he fell down before the
coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy was glowing in his mind
and in his heart. The one window of the cell was open, the air
was fresh and cool. <q>So the smell must have become stronger, if
they opened the window,</q> thought Alyosha. But even this thought
of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and
humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him feel miserable
or indignant. He began quietly praying, but he soon felt that he
was praying almost mechanically. Fragments of thought floated
through his soul, flashed like stars and went out again at once, to
be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning in his soul a
sense of the wholeness of things&mdash;something steadfast and comforting&mdash;and
he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying
ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....
</p>

<pb n='401'/><anchor id='Pg401'/>

<p>
But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something
else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what
had interrupted it. He began listening to what Father Païssy was
reading, but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze.
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;</emph></q>
read Father Païssy. <q><emph>And the mother of Jesus was there; And both
Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marriage? What's that?... A marriage!</q> floated whirling
through Alyosha's mind. <q>There is happiness for her, too.... She
has gone to the feast.... No, she has not taken the knife....
That was only a tragic phrase.... Well ... tragic phrases should
be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases comfort the heart....
Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to bear. Rakitin
has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broods over
his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the
high road ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal,
and the sun is at the end of it.... Ah!... What's being
read?</q>...
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine</emph></q> ... Alyosha heard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn't want to miss it, I love
that passage: it's Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that
miracle! Ah, that sweet miracle! It was not men's grief, but
their joy Christ visited, He worked His first miracle to help men's
gladness.... <q>He who loves men loves their gladness, too</q> ...
He was always repeating that, it was one of his leading ideas....
<q>There's no living without joy,</q> Mitya says.... Yes, Mitya....
<q>Everything that is true and good is always full of forgiveness,</q> he
used to say that, too</q> ...
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or
me? Mine hour is not yet come.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
you, do it</emph></q> ...
</p>

<p>
<q>Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor,
people.... Of course they were poor, since they hadn't wine
enough even at a wedding.... The historians write that, in those
days, the people living about the Lake of Gennesaret were the poorest
that can possibly be imagined ... and another great heart,
<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>
that other great being, His Mother, knew that He had come not
only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that His heart
was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure
and unlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor
wedding. <q>Mine hour is not yet come,</q> He said, with a soft smile
(He must have smiled gently to her). And, indeed, was it to make
wine abundant at poor weddings He had come down to earth?
And yet He went and did as she asked Him.... Ah, he is
reading again</q>....
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor
of the feast. And they bare it.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><emph>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew
the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
good wine; and when men have well drunk, that which is worse;
but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?...
Ah, yes ... It's the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of
course. Here are the guests, here are the young couple sitting,
and the merry crowd and ... Where is the wise governor of the
feast? But who is this? Who? Again the walls are receding....
Who is getting up there from the great table? What!... He
here, too? But he's in the coffin ... but he's here, too. He has
stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!</q>...
</p>

<p>
Yes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man,
with tiny wrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There
was no coffin now, and he was in the same dress as he had worn
yesterday sitting with them, when the visitors had gathered about
him. His face was uncovered, his eyes were shining. How was this,
then? He, too, had been called to the feast. He, too, at the marriage
of Cana in Galilee....
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,</q> he heard a
soft voice saying over him. <q>Why have you hidden yourself here,
out of sight? You come and join us too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>

<p>
It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he,
since he called him!
</p>

<p>
The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are rejoicing,</q> the little, thin old man went on. <q>We are
drinking the new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see
how many guests? Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the
wise governor of the feast, he is tasting the new wine. Why do
you wonder at me? I gave an onion to a beggar, so I, too, am here.
And many here have given only an onion each&mdash;only one little
onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle one, you,
my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman
an onion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!...
Do you see our Sun, do you see Him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid ... I dare not look,</q> whispered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His
sublimity, but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto
us from love and rejoices with us. He is changing the water into
wine that the gladness of the guests may not be cut short. He is
expecting new guests, He is calling new ones unceasingly for ever
and ever.... There they are bringing new wine. Do you see they
are bringing the vessels....</q>
</p>

<p>
Something glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it till it
ached, tears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out
his hands, uttered a cry and waked up.
</p>

<p>
Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct
reading of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading.
It was strange, he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was
on his feet, and suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three
firm rapid steps he went right up to the coffin. His shoulder
brushed against Father Païssy without his noticing it. Father Païssy
raised his eyes for an instant from his book, but looked away again
at once, seeing that something strange was happening to the boy.
Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at the covered, motionless
dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on his breast
and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. He had
only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing in
his ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly
he turned sharply and went out of the cell.
</p>

<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>

<p>
He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his
soul, overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness.
The vault of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched
vast and fathomless above him. The Milky Way ran in two pale
streams from the zenith to the horizon. The fresh, motionless, still
night enfolded the earth. The white towers and golden domes of
the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire sky. The gorgeous
autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were slumbering till
morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the silence of
the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the
stars....
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the
earth. He did not know why he embraced it. He could not have
told why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he
kissed it weeping, sobbing and watering it with his tears, and vowed
passionately to love it, to love it for ever and ever. <q>Water the
earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears,</q> echoed in his
soul.
</p>

<p>
What was he weeping over?
</p>

<p>
Oh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which
were shining to him from the abyss of space, and <q>he was not
ashamed of that ecstasy.</q> There seemed to be threads from all those
innumerable worlds of God, linking his soul to them, and it was
trembling all over <q>in contact with other worlds.</q> He longed to
forgive every one and for everything, and to beg forgiveness. Oh,
not for himself, but for all men, for all and for everything. <q>And
others are praying for me too,</q> echoed again in his soul. But with
every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that something
firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his
soul. It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his
mind&mdash;and it was for all his life and for ever and ever. He had
fallen on the earth a weak boy, but he rose up a resolute champion,
and he knew and felt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy.
And never, never, all his life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some one visited my soul in that hour,</q> he used to say afterwards,
with implicit faith in his words.
</p>

<p>
Within three days he left the monastery in accordance with the
words of his elder, who had bidden him <q>sojourn in the world.</q>

<head>Chapter I. Kuzma Samsonov</head>

<p>
But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life,
had left her last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of
her love for ever, knew nothing of what had happened to her, and
was at that moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity.
For the last two days he had been in such an inconceivable
state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill with brain fever,
as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able to find
him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting
him at the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by
his orders, concealed his movements.
</p>

<p>
He had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,
<q>struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,</q> as he
expressed it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a
dash out of the town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him
to lose sight of Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained
afterwards in detail, and confirmed by documentary evidence; but
for the present we will only note the most essential incidents of
those two terrible days immediately preceding the awful catastrophe,
that broke so suddenly upon him.
</p>

<p>
Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely
and sincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and
mercilessly. The worst of it was that he could never tell what she
meant to do. To prevail upon her by force or kindness was also
impossible: she would yield to nothing. She would only have become
angry and turned away from him altogether, he knew that
well already. He suspected, quite correctly, that she, too, was passing
through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary
<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>
indecision, that she was making up her mind to something, and unable
to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he
divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate
him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing
Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting
question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p>

<p>
Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly
persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered,
Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe
that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand
roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge
of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could
believe at times that all Grushenka's uneasiness rose from not knowing
which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to
think of the approaching return of the <q>officer,</q> that is, of the man
who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka's life, and whose
arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true
that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was
perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her
seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew,
too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had
shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly
any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.
Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle
with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining
any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did
not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up again after five years'
disappearance, still less in his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the <q>officer's</q>
first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility
of his new rival's visit was very vaguely suggested. The letter was
very indefinite, high-flown, and full of sentimentality. It must be
noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the
letter, in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had,
besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered afterwards, a certain
involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on
Grushenka's face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed
<pb n='407'/><anchor id='Pg407'/>
later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely
forgotten the officer's existence.
</p>

<p>
He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things
might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon
him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart
he was expecting every moment Grushenka's decision, always believing
that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment.
All of a sudden she would say to him: <q>Take me, I'm yours for ever,</q>
and it would all be over. He would seize her and bear her away
at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her away
at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia,
if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with
her incognito, so that no one would know anything about them,
there, here, or anywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin
at once!
</p>

<p>
Of this different, reformed and <q>virtuous</q> life (<q>it must, it
must be virtuous</q>) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He
thirsted for that reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in
which he had sunk of his own free will, was too revolting to him,
and, like very many men in such cases, he put faith above all in
change of place. If only it were not for these people, if only it
were not for these circumstances, if only he could fly away from
this accursed place&mdash;he would be altogether regenerated, would
enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and what he
was yearning for.
</p>

<p>
But all this could only be on condition of the first, the <emph>happy</emph>
solution of the question. There was another possibility, a different
and awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: <q>Go away. I
have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to
marry him and don't want you</q>&mdash;and then ... but then....
But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to the last
hour he didn't know. That must be said to his credit. He had no
definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching
and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy
solution of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But
for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental,
but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.
</p>

<p>
If she were to say to him: <q>I'm yours; take me away,</q> how could
<pb n='408'/><anchor id='Pg408'/>
he take her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it?
It was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor
Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption for so
many years, ceased. Grushenka had money, of course, but with
regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride; he
wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself,
at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive of taking
her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion.
I won't enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine
myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All
this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret
stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that
he had dishonestly appropriated. <q>I've been a scoundrel to one of
them, and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly,</q> was
his feeling then, as he explained after: <q>and when Grushenka knows,
she won't care for such a scoundrel.</q>
</p>

<p>
Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the
fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be
done, <q>and only because I hadn't the money. Oh, the shame of it!</q>
</p>

<p>
To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the
money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no
more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble,
I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that
sum he knew of, to <emph>have the right</emph> to take it, he must first restore
Katerina Ivanovna's three thousand&mdash;if not, <q>I'm a common pickpocket,
I'm a scoundrel, and I don't want to begin a new life as a
scoundrel,</q> Mitya decided. And so he made up his mind to move
heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand,
and that <emph>first of all</emph>. The final stage of this decision, so to say,
had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last
interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the
evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and
Mitya, after hearing Alyosha's account of it, had admitted that he
was a scoundrel, and told him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it
could be any comfort to her. After parting from his brother on that
night, he had felt in his frenzy that it would be better <q>to murder
and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to Katya. I'd rather
every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I'd rather go to
<pb n='409'/><anchor id='Pg409'/>
Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived
her and stole her money, and used her money to run away with
Grushenka and begin a new life! That I can't do!</q> So Mitya
decided, grinding his teeth, and he might well fancy at times that
his brain would give way. But meanwhile he went on struggling....
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing
left for him but despair&mdash;for what chance had he, with nothing
in the world, to raise such a sum?&mdash;yet to the very end he persisted
in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that the money
would somehow come to him of itself, as though it might drop from
heaven. That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have
never had anything to do with money, except to squander what
has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own,
and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most
fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he
had parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts
into a tangle of confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on
a perfectly wild enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in
such circumstances the most impossible, fantastic schemes occur
first, and seem most practical.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who
was Grushenka's protector, and to propose a <q>scheme</q> to him, and
by means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum
required. Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt,
not the slightest, and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look
upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from any but the
commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by
sight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a
word to him. But for some unknown reason he had long entertained
the conviction that the old reprobate, who was lying at
death's door, would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka's securing
a respectable position, and marrying a man <q>to be depended
upon.</q> And he believed not only that he would not object, but
that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that he
would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some
stray word of Grushenka's, he had gathered further that the old man
would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.
</p>

<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>

<p>
Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning
on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak,
from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness
and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon
Grushenka's past as something completely over. He looked on that
past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion
that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry
him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new
Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and
would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri
looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in
that remote past of Grushenka's, though she had never loved him,
and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with,
and, so to say, non-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon
him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that
he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had
changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that
this had been so for a long time.
</p>

<p>
In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya's part in all this,
for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It
was an instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded
that, being on the eve of his departure for the next world, old
Kuzma must sincerely repent of his past relations with Grushenka,
and that she had no more devoted friend and protector in the world
than this, now harmless old man.
</p>

<p>
After his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly
slept all night, and at ten o'clock next morning, he was at the
house of Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was
a very large and gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and
outhouses. In the lower story lived Samsonov's two married sons
with their families, his old sister, and his unmarried daughter. In the
lodge lived two of his clerks, one of whom also had a large family.
Both the lodge and the lower story were overcrowded, but the old
man kept the upper floor to himself, and would not even let the
daughter live there with him, though she waited upon him, and in
spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours, and at any
time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.
</p>

<p>
This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely
<pb n='411'/><anchor id='Pg411'/>
for show, furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long
monotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with
glass chandeliers under shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls.
All these rooms were entirely empty and unused, for the old man
kept to one room, a small, remote bedroom, where he was waited
upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her head, and by a lad,
who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to his swollen
legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only rarely lifted
from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting him led
him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and
taciturn even with this old woman.
</p>

<p>
When he was informed of the arrival of the <q>captain,</q> he at once
refused to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again.
Samsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like?
Whether he was drunk? Was he going to make a row? The answer
he received was: that he was sober, but wouldn't go away. The old
man again refused to see him. Then Mitya, who had foreseen this,
and purposely brought pencil and paper with him, wrote clearly
on the piece of paper the words: <q>On most important business closely
concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,</q> and sent it up to the old man.
</p>

<p>
After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor
to the drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a
summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This
younger son, a man over six foot and of exceptional physical
strength, who was closely-shaven and dressed in the European style,
though his father still wore a kaftan and a beard, came at once
without a comment. All the family trembled before the father.
The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of
the <q>captain</q> (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in
order to have a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by
his son and the servant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room.
It may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity. The
drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him was a vast, dreary
room that laid a weight of depression on the heart. It had a double
row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and three immense chandeliers
with glass lusters covered with shades.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his
fate with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the
<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>
opposite door, seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with
his long, military stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well
dressed, in a frock-coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black
gloves in his hands, just as he had been three days before at the
elder's, at the family meeting with his father and brothers. The old
man waited for him, standing dignified and unbending, and Mitya
felt at once that he had looked him through and through as he advanced.
Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's immensely
swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick,
hung down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in
dignified silence, motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and,
leaning on his son's arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa
opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his painful
exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of
his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he had
ventured to disturb.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it you want of me, sir?</q> said the old man, deliberately,
distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.
</p>

<p>
Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at
once speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive
frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on
the brink of ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he
failed. Old Samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant, though
his face remained cold and immovable as a statue's.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard
more than once of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Karamazov, who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother ...
seeing the whole town is gossiping about it ... for here
every one's gossiping of what they shouldn't ... and besides, it
might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your pardon,
through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna,
the lady for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...</q>
</p>

<p>
So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will
not reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize
the gist of it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention
(Mitya purposely used these words instead of <q>intentionally</q>)
consulted a lawyer in the chief town of the province, <q>a distinguished
lawyer, Kuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov.
<pb n='413'/><anchor id='Pg413'/>
You have perhaps heard of him? A man of vast intellect, the mind
of a statesman ... he knows you, too ... spoke of you in the
highest terms ...</q> Mitya broke down again. But these breaks
did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled
on and on.
</p>

<p>
This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting
the documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat
vaguely to these documents, and slurred over the subject with special
haste), reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning
the village of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have
come to him, Mitya, from his mother, and so checkmate the old
villain, his father ... <q>because every door was not closed and
justice might still find a loophole.</q> In fact, he might reckon on an
additional sum of six or even seven thousand roubles from Fyodor
Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least, twenty-five thousand,
he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact, <q>thirty, thirty,
Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn't get seventeen
from that heartless man!</q> So he, Mitya, had thrown the business
up, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming
here was struck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya
went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward), <q>so will
not you, excellent and honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take
up all my claims against that unnatural monster, and pay me a sum
down of only three thousand?... You see, you cannot, in any
case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear that. Quite
the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of three.</q>
Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll do the business with you at a notary's, or whatever it is ...
in fact, I'm ready to do anything.... I'll hand over all the deeds ...
whatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw
up the agreement at once ... and if it were possible, if it were only
