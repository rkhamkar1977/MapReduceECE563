<p>
<q>Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow.
Are you so worried?</q> He smiled contemptuously and suddenly
laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen; I've told you I won't go away without an answer!</q> Ivan
cried, intensely irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?</q>
said Smerdyakov, with a look of suffering.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn it! I've nothing to do with you. Just answer my question
and I'll go away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've no answer to give you,</q> said Smerdyakov, looking down
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You may be sure I'll make you answer!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you so uneasy?</q> Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply
with contempt, but almost with repulsion. <q>Is this because the trial
begins to-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can't you believe
that at last? Go home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don't be afraid
of anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?</q>
Ivan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill
breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured
him with his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't understand?</q> he drawled reproachfully. <q>It's a
strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious
tone of this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary
in itself. He had not taken such a tone even at their last
interview.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you, you've nothing to be afraid of. I won't say anything
<pb n='704'/><anchor id='Pg704'/>
about you; there's no proof against you. I say, how your hands are
trembling! Why are your fingers moving like that? Go home, <emph>you</emph>
did not murder him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan started. He remembered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it was not I,</q> he faltered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you?</q> Smerdyakov caught him up again.
</p>

<p>
Ivan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes
on Ivan with insane hatred.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, it was you who murdered him, if that's it,</q> he whispered
furiously.
</p>

<p>
Ivan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something.
He laughed malignantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you
understand it now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All I understand is that you are mad.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aren't you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what's the
use of going on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still
trying to throw it all on me, to my face? <emph>You</emph> murdered him; you
are the real murderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful
servant, and it was following your words I did it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>Did</emph> it? Why, did you murder him?</q> Ivan turned cold.
</p>

<p>
Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all
over with a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him
wonderingly; probably the genuineness of Ivan's horror struck him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't mean to say you really did not know?</q> he faltered
mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still
gazed at him, and seemed unable to speak.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;</l>
<l>I won't wait till he comes back,</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
suddenly echoed in his head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom
sitting before me,</q> he muttered.
</p>

<p>
<q>There's no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No
doubt he is here, that third, between us.</q>
</p>

<pb n='705'/><anchor id='Pg705'/>

<p>
<q>Who is he? Who is here? What third person?</q> Ivan cried in
alarm, looking about him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.
</p>

<p>
<q>That third is God Himself&mdash;Providence. He is the third beside
us now. Only don't look for Him, you won't find Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a lie that you killed him!</q> Ivan cried madly. <q>You are
mad, or teasing me again!</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of
fear. He could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied
that Ivan knew everything and was trying to <q>throw it all on him
to his face.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a minute,</q> he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly
bringing up his left leg from under the table, he began turning up
his trouser leg. He was wearing long white stockings and slippers.
Slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his
stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm
of terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's mad!</q> he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back,
so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against
it, stiff and straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov,
who, entirely unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his
stocking, as though he were making an effort to get hold of something
with his fingers and pull it out. At last he got hold of it and
began pulling it out. Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper, or
perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on
the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here,</q> he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q> asked Ivan, trembling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Kindly look at it,</q> Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low
tone.
</p>

<p>
Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began
unfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though from
contact with a loathsome reptile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your hands keep twitching,</q> observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberately
unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were
three packets of hundred-rouble notes.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not
count them. Take them,</q> Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding
<pb n='706'/><anchor id='Pg706'/>
at the notes. Ivan sank back in his chair. He was as white as a
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
<q>You frightened me ... with your stocking,</q> he said, with a
strange grin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you really not have known till now?</q> Smerdyakov asked
once more.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother,
brother! Ach!</q> He suddenly clutched his head in both hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother's help or
without?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri
Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on
trembling? I can't speak properly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You were bold enough then. You said <q>everything was lawful,</q>
and how frightened you are now,</q> Smerdyakov muttered in surprise.
<q>Won't you have some lemonade? I'll ask for some at once. It's
very refreshing. Only I must hide this first.</q>
</p>

<p>
And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get
up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade
and bring it them, but, looking for something to cover up the
notes that she might not see them, he first took out his handkerchief,
and as it turned out to be very dirty, took up the big yellow book
that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table, and put it over the
notes. The book was <hi rend='italic'>The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the
Syrian</hi>. Ivan read it mechanically.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't have any lemonade,</q> he said. <q>Talk of me later. Sit
down and tell me how you did it. Tell me all about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better take off your greatcoat, or you'll be too hot.</q>
Ivan, as though he'd only just thought of it, took off his coat, and,
without getting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak, please, speak.</q>
</p>

<p>
He seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov
would tell him <emph>all</emph> about it.
</p>

<p>
<q>How it was done?</q> sighed Smerdyakov. <q>It was done in a most
natural way, following your very words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of my words later,</q> Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete
self-possession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting
<pb n='707'/><anchor id='Pg707'/>
as before. <q>Only tell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as
it happened. Don't forget anything. The details, above everything,
the details, I beg you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd gone away, then I fell into the cellar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a fit or in a sham one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down
the steps to the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay
down I gave a scream, and struggled, till they carried me out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in
the hospital?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took
me to the hospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than
I've had for years. For two days I was quite unconscious.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right. Go on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They laid me on the bed. I knew I'd be the other side of the
partition, for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me
there, near them. She's always been very kind to me, from my birth
up. At night I moaned, but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri
Fyodorovitch to come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Expecting him? To come to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I'd no
doubt that he'd come that night, for being without me and getting
no news, he'd be sure to come and climb over the fence, as he used
to, and do something.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And if he hadn't come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then nothing would have happened. I should never have
brought myself to it without him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don't hurry;
above all, don't leave anything out!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was
certain, for I had prepared him for it ... during the last few
days.... He knew about the knocks, that was the chief thing.
With his suspiciousness and the fury which had been growing in
him all those days, he was bound to get into the house by means of
those taps. That was inevitable, so I was expecting him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> Ivan interrupted; <q>if he had killed him, he would have
taken the money and carried it away; you must have considered that.
What would you have got by it afterwards? I don't see.</q>
</p>

<pb n='708'/><anchor id='Pg708'/>

<p>
<q>But he would never have found the money. That was only
what I told him, that the money was under the mattress. But that
wasn't true. It had been lying in a box. And afterwards I suggested
to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I was the only person he trusted,
to hide the envelope with the notes in the corner behind the ikons,
for no one would have guessed that place, especially if they came in
a hurry. So that's where the envelope lay, in the corner behind the
ikons. It would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress;
the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was under the
mattress. A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had committed the murder, finding nothing, he would either have
run away in a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with
murderers, or he would have been arrested. So I could always have
clambered up to the ikons and have taken away the money next
morning or even that night, and it would have all been put down to
Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon upon that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured
to take the money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated
that he would beat him senseless, and I should have time to
take it then, and then I'd make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it
was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch who had taken the money
after beating him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all
who killed him; you only took the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, he didn't kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now
that he was the murderer.... But I don't want to lie to you now,
because ... because if you really haven't understood till now, as
I see for myself, and are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt
on me to my very face, you are still responsible for it all, since you
knew of the murder and charged me to do it, and went away knowing
all about it. And so I want to prove to your face this evening
that you are the only real murderer in the whole affair, and I am
not the real murderer, though I did kill him. You are the rightful
murderer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!</q> Ivan cried, unable to
restrain himself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing
himself till the end of the conversation. <q>You still mean that
<pb n='709'/><anchor id='Pg709'/>
Tchermashnya? Stay, tell me, why did you want my consent, if you
really took Tchermashnya for consent? How will you explain that
now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn't
have made an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if
I'd been suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice;
on the contrary, you would have protected me from
others.... And when you got your inheritance you would have
rewarded me when you were able, all the rest of your life. For
you'd have received your inheritance through me, seeing that if he
had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn't have had a
farthing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,</q>
snarled Ivan. <q>And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had informed
against you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to
Tchermashnya? That's all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation
you would either have gone away or have stayed. If you had
stayed, nothing would have happened. I should have known that
you didn't want it done, and should have attempted nothing. As
you went away, it meant you assured me that you wouldn't dare to
inform against me at the trial, and that you'd overlook my having
the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn't have prosecuted
me afterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court;
that is, not that I had stolen the money or killed him&mdash;I shouldn't
have said that&mdash;but that you'd put me up to the theft and the
murder, though I didn't consent to it. That's why I needed your
consent, so that you couldn't have cornered me afterwards, for what
proof could you have had? I could always have cornered you, revealing
your eagerness for your father's death, and I tell you the
public would have believed it all, and you would have been ashamed
for the rest of your life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Was I then so eager, was I?</q> Ivan snarled again.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned
my doing it.</q> Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He
was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner
force urged him on. He evidently had some design. Ivan felt that.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go on,</q> he said. <q>Tell me what happened that night.</q>
</p>

<pb n='710'/><anchor id='Pg710'/>

<p>
<q>What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard
the master shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly
got up and came out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then
all was silence and darkness. I lay there waiting, my heart beating;
I couldn't bear it. I got up at last, went out. I saw the window
open on the left into the garden, and I stepped to the left to listen
whether he was sitting there alive, and I heard the master moving
about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. <q>Ech!</q> I thought. I went
to the window and shouted to the master, <q>It's I.</q> And he shouted
to me, <q>He's been, he's been; he's run away.</q> He meant Dmitri
Fyodorovitch had been. <q>He's killed Grigory!</q> <q>Where?</q> I whispered.
<q>There, in the corner,</q> he pointed. He was whispering, too.
<q>Wait a bit,</q> I said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and
there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered
with blood, senseless. So it's true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been
here, was the thought that came into my head, and I determined on
the spot to make an end of it, as Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he
were alive, would see nothing of it, as he lay there senseless. The
only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up. I felt that at
the moment, but the longing to get it done came over me, till I could
scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the master and said,
<q>She's here, she's come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants to
be let in.</q> And he started like a baby. <q>Where is she?</q> he fairly
gasped, but couldn't believe it. <q>She's standing there,</q> said I.
<q>Open.</q> He looked out of the window at me, half believing and
half distrustful, but afraid to open. <q>Why, he is afraid of me now,</q>
I thought. And it was funny. I bethought me to knock on the
window-frame those taps we'd agreed upon as a signal that
Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his eyes. He didn't
seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps, he ran
at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, but
he stood in the way to prevent me passing. <q>Where is she? Where
is she?</q> He looked at me, all of a tremble. <q>Well,</q> thought I, <q>if
he's so frightened of me as all that, it's a bad look out!</q> And my
legs went weak with fright that he wouldn't let me in or would call
out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up, or something else might
happen. I don't remember now, but I must have stood pale, facing
him. I whispered to him, <q>Why, she's there, there, under the window;
<pb n='711'/><anchor id='Pg711'/>
how is it you don't see her?</q> I said. <q>Bring her then, bring
her.</q> <q>She's afraid,</q> said I; <q>she was frightened at the noise, she's
hidden in the bushes; go and call to her yourself from the study.</q>
He ran to the window, put the candle in the window. <q>Grushenka,</q>
he cried, <q>Grushenka, are you here?</q> Though he cried that, he
didn't want to lean out of the window, he didn't want to move away
from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn't
dare to turn his back on me. <q>Why, here she is,</q> said I. I went
up to the window and leaned right out of it. <q>Here she is; she's in
the bush, laughing at you, don't you see her?</q> He suddenly believed
it; he was all of a shake&mdash;he was awfully crazy about her&mdash;and
he leaned right out of the window. I snatched up that iron
paper-weight from his table; do you remember, weighing about three
pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the
corner of it. He didn't even cry out. He only sank down suddenly,
and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time I
knew I'd broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face
upwards, covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood
on me, not a spot. I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up
to the ikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung the
envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it. I went out into
the garden all of a tremble, straight to the apple-tree with a hollow
in it&mdash;you know that hollow. I'd marked it long before and put a
rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I wrapped all the notes in the
rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And there it stayed for
over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out of the
hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, <q>If Grigory
Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me,
but if he is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he'll
bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he
must have killed him and taken the money.</q> Then I began groaning
with suspense and impatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as
soon as possible. At last she got up and she rushed to me, but when
she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there, she ran out, and I
heard her scream in the garden. And that set it all going and set
my mind at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without
stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov
<pb n='712'/><anchor id='Pg712'/>
glanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept
his eyes averted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated
and was breathing hard. The perspiration stood out on his face.
But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he was feeling,
or what.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> cried Ivan, pondering. <q>What about the door? If he
only opened the door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open
before? For Grigory saw it before you went.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different
tone, not angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at
that moment and peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded
that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary, though
interesting, subject.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch's having seen it
open, that's only his fancy,</q> said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile.
<q>He is not a man, I assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn't
see it, but fancied he had seen it, and there's no shaking him. It's
just our luck he took that notion into his head, for they can't fail
to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch after that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen ...</q> said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and
making an effort to grasp something. <q>Listen. There are a lot of
questions I want to ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting
and getting mixed up. Yes. Tell me this at least, why
did you open the envelope and leave it there on the floor? Why
didn't you simply carry off the envelope?... When you were
telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the right
thing to do ... but why, I can't understand....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about
it, as I did for instance, if he'd seen those notes before, and perhaps
had put them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope
sealed up and addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done
the murder, what should have made him tear open the envelope
afterwards, especially in such desperate haste, since he'd know for
certain the notes must be in the envelope? No, if the robber had
been some one like me, he'd simply have put the envelope straight
in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he could. But it'd be
quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew about the
envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he'd found it, for
<pb n='713'/><anchor id='Pg713'/>
instance, under the mattress, he'd have torn it open as quickly as
possible to make sure the notes were in it. And he'd have thrown
the envelope down, without having time to think that it would be
evidence against him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had
never directly stolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born,
and if he did bring himself to steal, it would not be regular stealing,
but simply taking what was his own, for he'd told the whole town
he meant to before, and had even bragged aloud before every one
that he'd go and take his property from Fyodor Pavlovitch. I
didn't say that openly to the prosecutor when I was being examined,
but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as though I
didn't see it myself, and as though he'd thought of it himself and
I hadn't prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor's mouth positively
watered at my suggestion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?</q>
cried Ivan, overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov
again with alarm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate
hurry? It was all thought out beforehand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!</q> Ivan cried again.
<q>No, you are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....</q>
</p>

<p>
He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He
was in terrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there
was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only
turned round where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the
impossibility of moving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out
almost as furiously as before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don't you understand
that if I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am keeping
you to answer to-morrow at the trial. God sees,</q> Ivan raised
his hand, <q>perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret
desire for my father's ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty
as you think, and perhaps I didn't urge you on at all. No, no, I
didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence against
myself to-morrow at the trial. I'm determined to! I shall tell
everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance together.
And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence
you give, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you. I'll confirm
<pb n='714'/><anchor id='Pg714'/>
it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must, you must;
we'll go together. That's how it shall be!</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes
alone it could be seen that it would be so.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,</q>
Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent
sympathy in fact.
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll go together,</q> Ivan repeated. <q>And if you won't go, no
matter, I'll go alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.
</p>

<p>
<q>There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go,</q> he concluded
at last positively.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't understand me,</q> Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what's
more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I
never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill
(and it looks like it, too), or that you're so sorry for your brother
that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it
all against me, for you've always thought no more of me than if
I'd been a fly. And who will believe you, and what single proof
have you got?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take that money away with you,</q> Smerdyakov sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you
committed the murder for the sake of it?</q> Ivan looked at him
with great surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want it,</q> Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice,
with a gesture of refusal. <q>I did have an idea of beginning a new
life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream
of it, chiefly because <q>all things are lawful.</q> That was quite right
what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about that. For if
there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as virtue, and
there's no need of it. You were right there. So that's how I
looked at it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you come to that of yourself?</q> asked Ivan, with a wry
smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>With your guidance.</q>
</p>

<pb n='715'/><anchor id='Pg715'/>

<p>
<q>And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving
back the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I don't believe,</q> whispered Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then why are you giving it back?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave off ... that's enough!</q> Smerdyakov waved his hand
again. <q>You used to say yourself that everything was lawful, so
now why are you so upset, too? You even want to go and give
evidence against yourself.... Only there'll be nothing of the
sort! You won't go to give evidence,</q> Smerdyakov decided with
conviction.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll see,</q> said Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money,
I know that. You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud;
you are far too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most
of all about living in undisturbed comfort, without having to
depend on any one&mdash;that's what you care most about. You won't
want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself.
You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like him than
any of his children; you've the same soul as he had.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not a fool,</q> said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood
rushed to his face. <q>You are serious now!</q> he observed, looking suddenly
at Smerdyakov with a different expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the
money.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket
without wrapping them in anything.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall show them at the court to-morrow,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nobody will believe you, as you've plenty of money of your own;
you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought
it to the court.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>I repeat,</q> he said, <q>the only reason I haven't killed you is that I
need you for to-morrow, remember that, don't forget it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, kill me. Kill me now,</q> Smerdyakov said, all at once looking
strangely at Ivan. <q>You won't dare do that even!</q> he added,
with a bitter smile. <q>You won't dare to do anything, you, who
used to be so bold!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-morrow,</q> cried Ivan, and moved to go out.
</p>

<pb n='716'/><anchor id='Pg716'/>

<p>
<q>Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov
looked at them for ten seconds.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you can go,</q> he said, with a wave of his hand. <q>Ivan
Fyodorovitch!</q> he called after him again.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q> Ivan turned without stopping.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-morrow!</q> Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps
boldly, but suddenly began staggering. <q>It's something physical,</q>
he thought with a grin. Something like joy was springing up in his
heart. He was conscious of unbounded resolution; he would make
an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late. His
determination was taken, <q>and now it will not be changed,</q> he
thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against something
and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his
feet the peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless.
The snow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized
him and lifted him in his arms. Seeing a light in the little house
to the right he went up, knocked at the shutters, and asked the man
to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the
police-station, promising him three roubles. The man got ready
and came out. I won't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his
object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging for
a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the
expenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but
Ivan was well content with it. His mind wandered and worked
incessantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,</q> he
reflected with satisfaction, <q>I should not have stayed a whole hour to
look after the peasant, but should have passed by, without caring
about his being frozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by
the way,</q> he thought at the same instant, with still greater satisfaction,
<q>although they have decided that I am going out of my
mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
Just as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself
suddenly hadn't he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell
<pb n='717'/><anchor id='Pg717'/>
him everything. He decided the question by turning back to the
house. <q>Everything together to-morrow!</q> he whispered to himself,
and, strange to say, almost all his gladness and self-satisfaction
passed in one instant.
</p>

<p>
As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice
on his heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of
something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at
that moment, and had been there before. He sank wearily on his
sofa. The old woman brought him a samovar; he made tea, but
did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt giddy. He felt that
he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop asleep, but got
up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness.
At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness that
he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round,
as though searching for something. This happened several times.
At last his eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled,
but an angry flush suffused his face. He sat a long time in his
place, his head propped on both arms, though he looked sideways at
the same point, at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall.
There was evidently something, some object, that irritated him there,
worried him and tormented him.

<head>Chapter IX. The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare</head>

<p>
I am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when
I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of
Ivan's illness. Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he
was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever.
Though his health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn
resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery
over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard
the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible effort of
will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of course,
to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he
loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching
<pb n='718'/><anchor id='Pg718'/>
crisis in his life, when he needed to have all his wits about him,
to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and <q>to justify
himself to himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been
brought from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's
to which I have referred already. After listening to him and examining
him the doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually
suffering from some disorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised
by an admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him.
<q>Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,</q> the doctor
opined, <q>though it would be better to verify them ... you must
take steps at once, without a moment's delay, or things will go
badly with you.</q> But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice
and did not take to his bed to be nursed. <q>I am walking about, so
I am strong enough, if I drop, it'll be different then, any one may
nurse me who likes,</q> he decided, dismissing the subject.
</p>

<p>
And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium
and, as I have said already, looking persistently at some object on
the sofa against the opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting
there, though goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not
been in the room when Ivan came into it, on his return from
Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a
Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young,
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>qui faisait la cinquantaine</foreign>,
as the French say, with rather long, still thick, dark
hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed beard. He
was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made
by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,
that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last
two years. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such
as are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection
his linen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very
threadbare. The visitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but
were too light in color and too tight for the present fashion. His
soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season.
</p>

<p>
In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened
means. It looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class
of idle landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom.
He had unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable
<pb n='719'/><anchor id='Pg719'/>
society, had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them
indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished
on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor
relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to
another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating
disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could
be asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place
of honor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent
position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who
have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon
them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers.
Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always being
brought up at a distance, at some aunt's, to whom these gentlemen
never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the relationship.
They gradually lose sight of their children altogether, though at
intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and
sometimes even answer it.
</p>

<p>
The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured,
as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression
as occasion might arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell
lorgnette on a black ribbon. On the middle finger of his
right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it.
</p>

<p>
Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation.
The visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come
down from his room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly
silent, seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied.
But he was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host
should begin it. All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say,</q> he began to Ivan, <q>excuse me, I only mention it to remind
you. You went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina
Ivanovna, but you came away without finding out anything about
her, you probably forgot&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes,</q> broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with
uneasiness. <q>Yes, I'd forgotten ... but it doesn't matter now,
never mind, till to-morrow,</q> he muttered to himself, <q>and you,</q> he
added, addressing his visitor, <q>I should have remembered that myself
in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me! Why
<pb n='720'/><anchor id='Pg720'/>
do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me, and
that I didn't remember it of myself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't believe it then,</q> said the gentleman, smiling amicably,
<q>what's the good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs
are no help to believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed,
not because he saw Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe,
before he saw. Look at the spiritualists, for instance.... I am
very fond of them ... only fancy, they imagine that they are
serving the cause of religion, because the devils show them their
horns from the other world. That, they say, is a material proof, so
to speak, of the existence of another world. The other world and
material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does proving
there's a devil prove that there's a God? I want to join an idealist
society, I'll lead the opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist, but not
a materialist, he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen,</q> Ivan suddenly got up from the table. <q>I seem to be
delirious.... I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like,
I don't care! You won't drive me to fury, as you did last time.
But I feel somehow ashamed.... I want to walk about the room....
I sometimes don't see you and don't even hear your voice as
I did last time, but I always guess what you are prating, for it's I,
<emph>I myself speaking, not you</emph>. Only I don't know whether I was
dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I'll wet a towel
and put it on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and
with a wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,</q> the visitor began.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>do you suppose I should stand on ceremony
with you? I am in good spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead ...
and in the top of my head ... only please don't talk
philosophy, as you did last time. If you can't take yourself off,
talk of something amusing. Talk gossip, you are a poor relation,
you ought to talk gossip. What a nightmare to have! But I am not
afraid of you. I'll get the better of you. I won't be taken to a
mad-house!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est charmant</foreign>,
poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape.
For what am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am
listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually
<pb n='721'/><anchor id='Pg721'/>
beginning to take me for something real, not simply your fancy, as
you persisted in declaring last time&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,</q> Ivan cried
with a sort of fury. <q>You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a
phantom. It's only that I don't know how to destroy you and I see
I must suffer for a time. You are my hallucination. You are the
incarnation of myself, but only of one side of me ... of my
thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and stupidest of them.
From that point of view you might be of interest to me, if only
I had time to waste on you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, excuse me, I'll catch you. When you flew out at
Alyosha under the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him,
<q>You learnt it from <emph>him</emph>! How do you know that <emph>he</emph> visits
me?</q> you were thinking of me then. So for one brief moment you did
believe that I really exist,</q> the gentleman laughed blandly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn't believe
in you. I don't know whether I was asleep or awake last time.
Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn't see you really at all&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a
dear; I've treated him badly over Father Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!</q> Ivan
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
<q>You scold me, but you laugh&mdash;that's a good sign. But you are
ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why:
that great resolution of yours&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't speak of my resolution,</q> cried Ivan, savagely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand, I understand, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>c'est noble,
c'est charmant</foreign>, you are
going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ...
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est chevaleresque</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hold your tongue, I'll kick you!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained.
If you kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don't
kick ghosts. Joking apart, it doesn't matter to me, scold if you
like, though it's better to be a trifle more polite even to me. <q>Fool,
flunkey!</q> what words!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Scolding you, I scold myself,</q> Ivan laughed again, <q>you are
myself, myself, only with a different face. You just say what I am
thinking ... and are incapable of saying anything new!</q>
</p>

<pb n='722'/><anchor id='Pg722'/>

<p>
<q>If I am like you in my way of thinking, it's all to my credit,</q>
the gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.
</p>

<p>
<q>You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what's more, the
stupid ones. You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid.
No, I can't put up with you! What am I to do, what am I to do?</q>
Ivan said through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman
and to be recognized as such,</q> the visitor began in an excess
of deprecating and simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation.
<q>I am poor, but ... I won't say very honest, but ... it's an
axiom generally accepted in society that I am a fallen angel. I
certainly can't conceive how I can ever have been an angel. If I
ever was, it must have been so long ago that there's no harm in
forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a gentlemanly
person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I
love men genuinely, I've been greatly calumniated! Here when I
stay with you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality
and that's what I like most of all. You see, like you, I suffer
from the fantastic and so I love the realism of earth. Here, with
you, everything is circumscribed, here all is formulated and geometrical,
while we have nothing but indeterminate equations! I
wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming. Besides, on earth
I become superstitious. Please don't laugh, that's just what I like,
to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I've grown
fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go
and steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is
becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of
some merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all
she believes. My ideal is to go to church and offer a candle in
simple-hearted faith, upon my word it is. Then there would be an
end to my sufferings. I like being doctored too; in the spring there
was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was vaccinated in a
foundling hospital&mdash;if only you knew how I enjoyed myself that
day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But
you are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this
evening? I know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well,
what about your health? What did the doctor say?</q>
</p>

<pb n='723'/><anchor id='Pg723'/>

<p>
<q>Fool!</q> Ivan snapped out.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn't
ask out of sympathy. You needn't answer. Now rheumatism has
come in again&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fool!</q> repeated Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of
rheumatism last year that I remember it to this day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil have rheumatism!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly
form and I take the consequences. Satan <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sum
et nihil humanum a me alienum puto</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What, what, Satan <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sum
et nihil humanum</foreign> ... that's not bad
for the devil!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad I've pleased you at last.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you didn't get that from me.</q> Ivan stopped suddenly,
seeming struck. <q>That never entered my head, that's strange.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est du nouveau,
n'est-ce pas?</foreign> This time I'll act honestly and
explain to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from
indigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions,
such complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world
of events, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from
the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear
Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such dreams are sometimes
seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people, officials, journalists,
priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A statesman
confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him
when he was asleep. Well, that's how it is now, though I am your
hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which
