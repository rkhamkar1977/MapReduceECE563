
<p>
<q>It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,</q> answered the
clerk. <q>She brought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back
to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I saw one like it ... in the regiment ...</q> murmured Mitya
<pb n='456'/><anchor id='Pg456'/>
dreamily, <q>only that one had its hind leg broken.... By the
way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wanted to ask you: have you ever stolen anything
in your life?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a question!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I didn't mean anything. From somebody's pocket, you
know. I don't mean government money, every one steals that, and
no doubt you do, too....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You go to the devil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm talking of other people's money. Stealing straight out of a
pocket? Out of a purse, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years
old. I took it off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my
hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, and what happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed,
and gave it back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you
stolen something?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> said Mitya, winking slyly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have you stolen?</q> inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years
old, and gave it back three days after.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won't you come now?</q> called Andrey from
the door of the shop.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you ready? We'll come!</q> Mitya started. <q>A few more
last words and&mdash;Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him
some brandy as well! That box</q> (the one with the pistols) <q>put
under my seat. Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch, don't remember evil
against me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you're coming back to-morrow?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will you settle the little bill now?</q> cried the clerk, springing
forward.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, the bill. Of course.</q>
</p>

<p>
He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out
three hundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly
<pb n='457'/><anchor id='Pg457'/>
out of the shop. Every one followed him out, bowing and
wishing him good luck. Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had
just swallowed, jumped up on the box. But Mitya was only just
taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before
him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before him with a cry,
and plumped down at his feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don't
harm my mistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And
don't murder him, he came first, he's hers! He'll marry Agrafena
Alexandrovna now. That's why he's come back from Siberia.
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don't take a fellow creature's life!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;tut! That's it, is it? So you're off there to make
trouble!</q> muttered Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>Now, it's all clear, as clear as
daylight. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you
mean to behave like a man,</q> he shouted aloud to Mitya. <q>Do you
hear, Dmitri?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I'll throw them into the pool
on the road,</q> answered Mitya. <q>Fenya, get up, don't kneel to me.
Mitya won't hurt any one, the silly fool won't hurt any one again.
But I say, Fenya,</q> he shouted, after having taken his seat. <q>I hurt
you just now, so forgive me and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel....
But it doesn't matter if you don't. It's all the same now.
Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full speed!</q>
</p>

<p>
Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,</q> Pyotr
Ilyitch thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay
and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions,
knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly
feeling vexed with himself, he turned away with a curse and
went to the tavern to play billiards.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a fool, though he's a good fellow,</q> he muttered as he went.
<q>I've heard of that officer, Grushenka's former flame. Well, if he
has turned up.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I'm not his
nurse! Let them do what they like! Besides, it'll all come to
nothing. They're a set of brawlers, that's all. They'll drink and
fight, fight and make friends again. They are not men who do
anything real. What does he mean by <q>I'm stepping aside, I'm punishing
<pb n='458'/><anchor id='Pg458'/>
myself?</q> It'll come to nothing! He's shouted such phrases
a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he's not drunk.
<q>Drunk in spirit</q>&mdash;they're fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I
his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood.
With whom? I shall find out at the <q>Metropolis.</q> And his handkerchief
was soaked in blood.... It's still lying on my floor....
Hang it!</q>
</p>

<p>
He reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a
game. The game cheered him. He played a second game, and
suddenly began telling one of his partners that Dmitri Karamazov
had come in for some cash again&mdash;something like three thousand
roubles, and had gone to Mokroe again to spend it with Grushenka....
This news roused singular interest in his listeners. They all
spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity. They left off
playing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov's present
was received with skepticism.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hasn't he robbed his old father?&mdash;that's the question.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Three thousand! There's something odd about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him,
here. And it was three thousand he talked about ...</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in
his answers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya's face
and hands, though he had meant to speak of it at first.
</p>

<p>
They began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya
died away. But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no
more desire for billiards; he laid down the cue, and without having
supper as he had intended, he walked out of the tavern. When he
reached the market-place he stood still in perplexity, wondering at
himself. He realized that what he wanted was to go to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's and find out if anything had happened there. <q>On
account of some stupid nonsense&mdash;as it's sure to turn out&mdash;am I
going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn
it, is it my business to look after them?</q>
</p>

<p>
In a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered
Fenya. <q>Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her
just now,</q> he thought with vexation, <q>I should have heard everything.</q>
<pb n='459'/><anchor id='Pg459'/>
And the desire to speak to her, and so find out, became so
pressing and importunate that when he was half-way home he
turned abruptly and went towards the house where Grushenka
lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock
in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed.
And no one answered him; every one in the house was asleep.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I shall be making a fuss!</q> he thought, with a feeling of
positive discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell
to knocking again with all his might, filling the street with clamor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!</q> he muttered
at each knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled
his knocks on the gate.
</p>

<p>
But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was
a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey's three
horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered
in an hour and a quarter. The swift motion revived Mitya. The
air was fresh and cool, there were big stars shining in the sky. It
was the very night, and perhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha
fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.
</p>

<p>
All was confusion, confusion, in Mitya's soul, but although many
things were goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was
yearning for her, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her
for the last time. One thing I can say for certain; his heart did not
waver for one instant. I shall perhaps not be believed when I say
that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new
rival, who seemed to have sprung out of the earth. If any other
had appeared on the scene, he would have been jealous at once, and
would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again. But
as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no hostility even, for
the man who had been her first lover.... It is true he had not yet
seen him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his;
<pb n='460'/><anchor id='Pg460'/>
this was her first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten;
so she had loved him only for those five years, and I, how do I
come in? What right have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way!
What am I now? Now everything is over apart from the officer&mdash;even
if he had not appeared, everything would be over ...</q>
</p>

<p>
These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had
been capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment.
His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At
Fenya's first words, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted
in a flash, with all its consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution,
there was confusion in his soul, an agonizing confusion: his
resolution did not give him peace. There was so much behind that
tortured him. And it seemed strange to him, at moments, to think
that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper:
<q>I punish myself,</q> and the paper was lying there in his pocket,
ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next
morning, he would meet the first warm ray of <q>golden-haired
Phœbus.</q>
</p>

<p>
And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left
behind and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the
thought of it sank into his heart with despair. There was one moment
when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey, to jump out of the
cart, to pull out his loaded pistol, and to make an end of everything
without waiting for the dawn. But that moment flew by like a
spark. The horses galloped on, <q>devouring space,</q> and as he drew
near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took more
and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearful
images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon
her, if only for a moment, if only from a distance!
</p>

<p>
<q>She's now with <emph>him</emph>,</q> he thought, <q>now I shall see what she
looks like with him, her first love, and that's all I want.</q> Never had
this woman, who was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused
such love in his breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising
even to himself, a feeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement
before her! <q>I will efface myself!</q> he said, in a rush of almost
hysterical ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
They had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and
though Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter
<pb n='461'/><anchor id='Pg461'/>
a word, either. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up
smartly his three lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya
cried out in horrible anxiety:
</p>

<p>
<q>Andrey! What if they're asleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to
him before.
</p>

<p>
<q>It may well be that they're gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing
there ... with such feelings ... while they were asleep ...
she was asleep, perhaps, there too.... An angry feeling surged up
in his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!</q> he cried, beside
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>But maybe they're not in bed!</q> Andrey went on after a pause.
<q>Timofey said they were a lot of them there&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At the station?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn, where
they let out horses, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that?
Who are they?</q> cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected
news.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our
town&mdash;who they are I can't say&mdash;and there are two others, strangers,
maybe more besides. I didn't ask particularly. They've set to
playing cards, so Timofey said.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards. It's most likely
not more than eleven.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!</q> Mitya cried again, nervously.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I ask you something, sir?</q> said Andrey, after a pause.
<q>Only I'm afraid of angering you, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you
not to harm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see,
sir&mdash; It's I am taking you there ... forgive me, sir, it's my conscience ...
maybe it's stupid of me to speak of it&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.
</p>

<pb n='462'/><anchor id='Pg462'/>

<p>
<q>Are you a driver?</q> he asked frantically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you know that one has to make way. What would you
say to a driver who wouldn't make way for any one, but would
just drive on and crush people? No, a driver mustn't run over
people. One can't run over a man. One can't spoil people's lives.
And if you have spoilt a life&mdash;punish yourself.... If only you've
spoilt, if only you've ruined any one's life&mdash;punish yourself and go
away.</q>
</p>

<p>
These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though
Andrey was surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one
mustn't crush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every
creature is created by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some
folks, even among us drivers, drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain
them, they just force it along.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To hell?</q> Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short
laugh. <q>Andrey, simple soul,</q> he seized him by the shoulders again,
<q>tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not,
what do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you
see, sir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He
went straight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners
that were in agony. And the devil groaned, because he thought
that he would get no more sinners in hell. And God said to him,
then, <q>Don't groan, for you shall have all the mighty of the earth,
the rulers, the chief judges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up
as you have been in all the ages till I come again.</q> Those were His
very words ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you see, sir, who it is hell's for,</q> said Andrey, whipping up
the left horse, <q>but you're like a little child ... that's how we
look on you ... and though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God
will forgive you for your kind heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any
harm.</q>
</p>

<pb n='463'/><anchor id='Pg463'/>

<p>
<q>No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road,
will you forgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering
to himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn
me. Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for
I have condemned myself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee,
O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love Thee. If Thou sendest me to
hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there I shall cry out that I
love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love to the end....
Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of Thy
day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannot
help loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop
up, I shall fall before her and say, <q>You are right to pass on and
leave me. Farewell and forget your victim ... never fret yourself
about me!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mokroe!</q> cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.
</p>

<p>
Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass
of buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village
of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour
all were asleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on, Andrey, I come!</q> Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.
</p>

<p>
<q>They're not asleep,</q> said Andrey again, pointing with his whip
to the Plastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village.
The six windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.
</p>

<p>
<q>They're not asleep,</q> Mitya repeated joyously. <q>Quicker,
Andrey! Gallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing!
Let all know that I have come. I'm coming! I'm coming, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash
and pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.
</p>

<p>
Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way
to bed, peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.
</p>

<p>
<q>Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?</q>
</p>

<p>
The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps,
and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?</q>
</p>

<pb n='464'/><anchor id='Pg464'/>

<p>
Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle
height, with a rather fat face. His expression was severe and
uncompromising, especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had
the power of assuming the most obsequious countenance, when he
had an inkling that it was to his interest. He dressed in Russian
style, with a shirt buttoning down on one side, and a full-skirted
coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was for ever dreaming
of improving his position. More than half the peasants were in
his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him.
From the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which
were worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could
never shake off. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters.
One of them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her two
children, his grandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman.
Another of his daughters was married to a petty official, and in one
of the rooms of the inn, on the wall could be seen, among the family
photographs, a miniature photograph of this official in uniform and
official epaulettes. The two younger daughters used to wear fashionable
blue or green dresses, fitting tight at the back, and with
trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when they went to pay
visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as usual, sweep
out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean up
after lodgers.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch
was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest,
and remembering that not a month ago he had, in twenty-four
hours, made two if not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when
he had come on his escapade with Grushenka, he met him now with
eager welcome, scenting his prey the moment Mitya drove up to
the steps.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,</q> began Mitya, <q>first and foremost,
where is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Agrafena Alexandrovna?</q> The inn-keeper understood at once,
looking sharply into Mitya's face. <q>She's here, too ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With whom? With whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge
from his speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there's
<pb n='465'/><anchor id='Pg465'/>
another with him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there's no
telling. They're dressed like civilians.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, are they feasting? Have they money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They're two gentlemen from the town.... They've come back
from Tcherny, and are putting up here. One's quite a young gentleman,
a relative of Mr. Miüsov, he must be, but I've forgotten
his name ... and I expect you know the other, too, a gentleman
called Maximov. He's been on a pilgrimage, so he says, to the
monastery in the town. He's traveling with this young relation
of Mr. Miüsov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that all?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What
of her? How is she?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, she's only just come. She's sitting with them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I think she's not laughing much. She's sitting quite dull.
She's combing the young gentleman's hair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Pole&mdash;the officer?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's not young, and he's not an officer, either. Not him, sir.
It's the young gentleman that's Mr. Miüsov's relation ... I've forgotten
his name.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Kalganov.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's it, Kalganov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right. I'll see for myself. Are they playing cards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been
drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for myself.
Now answer one more question: are the gypsies here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The
authorities have sent them away. But we've Jews that play the
cymbals and the fiddle in the village, so one might send for them.
They'd come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Send for them. Certainly send for them!</q> cried Mitya. <q>And
you can get the girls together as you did then, Marya especially,
Stepanida, too, and Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!</q>
</p>

<pb n='466'/><anchor id='Pg466'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though
by now they're asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like
that on such coarseness and rudeness! What's the good of giving a
peasant a cigar to smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are
all lousy. Besides, I'll get my daughters up for nothing, let alone
a sum like that. They've only just gone to bed, I'll give them a
kick and set them singing for you. You gave the peasants champagne
to drink the other day, e&mdash;ech!</q>
</p>

<p>
For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch
had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion,
and had picked up a hundred-rouble note under the table, and
it had remained in his clutches.
</p>

<p>
<q>Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last
time I was here. Do you remember?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have
left three thousand behind you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?</q>
</p>

<p>
And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the
innkeeper's nose.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, listen and remember. In an hour's time the wine will arrive,
savories, pies, and sweets&mdash;bring them all up at once. That box
Andrey has got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand
champagne immediately. And the girls, we must have the girls,
Marya especially.</q>
</p>

<p>
He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here, Andrey, let's settle. Here's fifteen roubles for the drive,
and fifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love....
Remember Karamazov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm afraid, sir,</q> faltered Andrey. <q>Give me five roubles extra,
but more I won't take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive
my foolish words ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you afraid of?</q> asked Mitya, scanning him. <q>Well,
go to the devil, if that's it!</q> he cried, flinging him five roubles.
<q>Now, Trifon Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get
a look at them, so that they don't see me. Where are they? In the
blue room?</q>
</p>

<p>
Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once
<pb n='467'/><anchor id='Pg467'/>
obediently did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went
himself into the first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors
were sitting, and took the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya
in, and put him in a corner in the dark, whence he could freely
watch the company without being seen. But Mitya did not look
long, and, indeed, he could not see them, he saw her, his heart
throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside
her, on the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding
his hand and seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and
not looking at her, was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov,
who sat the other side of the table, facing Grushenka.
Maximov was laughing violently at something. On the sofa sat <emph>he</emph>,
and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger. The one on
the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had an
impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was
apparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger,
struck Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing
more. He caught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute,
he put the pistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he
walked, feeling cold all over, straight into the blue room to face the
company.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie!</q> shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter VII. The First And Rightful Lover</head>

<p>
With his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the
table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering
at every word, <q>I ... I'm all right! Don't be afraid!</q> he
exclaimed, <q>I&mdash;there's nothing the matter,</q> he turned suddenly to
Grushenka, who had shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov,
and clasped his hand tightly. <q>I ... I'm coming, too. I'm here
till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with you till morning? Only
till morning, for the last time, in this same room?</q>
</p>

<pb n='468'/><anchor id='Pg468'/>

<p>
So he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting
on the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity
and observed severely:
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Panie</foreign>, we're here in private. There are other
rooms.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?</q>
answered Kalganov suddenly. <q>Sit down with us. How are you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always
thought a lot of you.</q> Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at
once holding out his hand across the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,</q>
laughed Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>He always squeezes like that, always,</q> Grushenka put in gayly,
with a timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face
that he was not going to make a scene. She was watching him with
intense curiosity and still some uneasiness. She was impressed by
something about him, and indeed the last thing she expected of him
was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good evening,</q> Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya
rushed up to him, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good evening. You're here, too! How glad I am to find you
here, too! Gentlemen, gentlemen, I&mdash;</q> (He addressed the Polish
gentleman with the pipe again, evidently taking him for the most
important person present.) <q>I flew here.... I wanted to spend
my last day, my last hour in this room, in this very room ...
where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,
<foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q> he
cried wildly, <q>I flew here and vowed&mdash; Oh, don't be afraid, it's my
last night! Let's drink to our good understanding. They'll bring
the wine at once.... I brought this with me.</q> (Something made
him pull out his bundle of notes.) <q>Allow me, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>!
I want to have music, singing, a revel, as we had before. But the worm, the
unnecessary worm, will crawl away, and there'll be no more of him.
I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted
to say, but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips.
The Pole gazed fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand;
looked at Grushenka, and was in evident perplexity.
</p>

<p>
<q>If my suverin lady is permitting&mdash;</q> he was beginning.
</p>

<p>
<q>What does <q>suverin</q> mean? <q>Sovereign,</q> I suppose?</q> interrupted
<pb n='469'/><anchor id='Pg469'/>
Grushenka. <q>I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit
down, Mitya, what are you talking about? Don't frighten us,
please. You won't frighten us, will you? If you won't, I am glad
to see you ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Me, me frighten you?</q> cried Mitya, flinging up his hands.
<q>Oh, pass me by, go your way, I won't hinder you!...</q>
</p>

<p>
And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as
well, by flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning
his head away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back
of the chair tight, as though embracing it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, come, what a fellow you are!</q> cried Grushenka reproachfully.
<q>That's just how he comes to see me&mdash;he begins talking, and
I can't make out what he means. He cried like that once before,
and now he's crying again! It's shameful! Why are you crying?
<emph>As though you had anything to cry for!</emph></q> she added enigmatically,
emphasizing each word with some irritability.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... I'm not crying.... Well, good evening!</q> He instantly
turned round in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his
abrupt wooden laugh, but a long, quivering, inaudible nervous
laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!</q>
Grushenka said to him persuasively. <q>I'm very glad you've come,
very glad, Mitya, do you hear, I'm very glad! I want him to stay
here with us,</q> she said peremptorily, addressing the whole company,
though her words were obviously meant for the man sitting on the
sofa. <q>I wish it, I wish it! And if he goes away I shall go, too!</q>
she added with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>What my queen commands is law!</q> pronounced the Pole, gallantly
kissing Grushenka's hand. <q>I beg you, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,
to join our company,</q> he added politely, addressing Mitya.
</p>

<p>
Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering
another tirade, but the words did not come.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's drink, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>,</q>
he blurted out instead of making a speech.
Every one laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!</q> Grushenka
exclaimed nervously. <q>Do you hear, Mitya,</q> she went on
insistently, <q>don't prance about, but it's nice you've brought the
champagne. I want some myself, and I can't bear liqueurs. And
<pb n='470'/><anchor id='Pg470'/>
best of all, you've come yourself. We were fearfully dull here....
You've come for a spree again, I suppose? But put your money
in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled
bundle of notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were
fixed. In confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He
flushed. At that moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked
bottle of champagne, and glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up
the bottle, but he was so bewildered that he did not know what to
do with it. Kalganov took it from him and poured out the champagne.
</p>

<p>
<q>Another! Another bottle!</q> Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and,
forgetting to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly
invited to drink to their good understanding, he drank off his glass
without waiting for any one else. His whole countenance suddenly
changed. The solemn and tragic expression with which he had
entered vanished completely, and a look of something childlike came
into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued.
He looked shyly and happily at every one, with a continual
nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who has
done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten
everything, and was looking round at every one with a
childlike smile of delight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually,
and bringing his chair close up to her. By degrees he had
gained some idea of the two Poles, though he had formed no definite
conception of them yet.
</p>

<p>
The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and
his Polish accent; and, above all, by his pipe. <q>Well, what of it?
It's a good thing he's smoking a pipe,</q> he reflected. The Pole's
puffy, middle-aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin,
pointed, dyed and impudent-looking mustaches, had not so far
roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not even particularly
struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with love-locks
foolishly combed forward over the temples. <q>I suppose it's all right
since he wears a wig,</q> he went on, musing blissfully. The other,
younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company
and listening to the conversation with silent contempt, still
only impressed Mitya by his great height, which was in striking
<pb n='471'/><anchor id='Pg471'/>
contrast to the Pole on the sofa. <q>If he stood up he'd be six foot
three.</q> The thought flitted through Mitya's mind. It occurred
to him, too, that this Pole must be the friend of the other, as it
were, a <q>bodyguard,</q> and no doubt the big Pole was at the disposal
of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed to Mitya perfectly
right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglike submissiveness
all feeling of rivalry had died away.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words
he completely failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling
heart, was that she was kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and
made him sit by her. He was beside himself with delight, watching
her sip her glass of champagne. The silence of the company seemed
somehow to strike him, however, and he looked round at every one
with expectant eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don't you
begin doing something?</q> his smiling eyes seemed to ask.
</p>

<p>
<q>He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,</q> Kalganov
began suddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing
to Maximov.
</p>

<p>
Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's talking nonsense?</q> he laughed, his short, wooden laugh,
seeming suddenly delighted at something&mdash;<q>ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry
officers in the twenties married Polish women. That's awful rot,
isn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Polish women?</q> repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.
</p>

<p>
Kalganov was well aware of Mitya's attitude to Grushenka, and
he guessed about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest
him, perhaps did not interest him at all; what he was interested in
was Maximov. He had come here with Maximov by chance, and
he met the Poles here at the inn for the first time in his life. Grushenka
he knew before, and had once been with some one to see
her; but she had not taken to him. But here she looked at him
very affectionately: before Mitya's arrival, she had been making
much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He
was a boy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very
charming fair-skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his
fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and
<pb n='472'/><anchor id='Pg472'/>
sometimes even deep expression, beyond his age indeed, although
the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a child,
and was not at all ashamed of it, even when he was aware of it himself.
As a rule he was very willful, even capricious, though always
friendly. Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his
expression. He would look at you and listen, seeming all the while
to be persistently dreaming over something else. Often he was listless
and lazy, at other times he would grow excited, sometimes,
apparently, over the most trivial matters.
</p>

<p>
<q>Only imagine, I've been taking him about with me for the last
four days,</q> he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally
though, without the slightest affectation. <q>Ever since your
brother, do you remember, shoved him off the carriage and sent
him flying. That made me take an interest in him at the time, and
I took him into the country, but he keeps talking such rot I'm
ashamed to be with him. I'm taking him back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is
impossible,</q> the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.
</p>

<p>
He spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended.
If he used Russian words, he always distorted them into a
Polish form.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I was married to a Polish lady myself,</q> tittered Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the
cavalry. Were you a cavalry officer?</q> put in Kalganov at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!</q> cried Mitya, listening
eagerly, and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as
though there were no knowing what he might hear from each.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, you see,</q> Maximov turned to him. <q>What I mean is that
those pretty Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with
our Uhlans ... when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan
she jumps on his knee like a kitten ... a little white one ...
and the <hi rend='italic'>pan</hi>-father and <hi rend='italic'>pan</hi>-mother
look on and allow it....
They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes and offers her his
hand.... That's how it is ... offers her his hand, he he!</q> Maximov
ended, tittering.
</p>

<p>
<q>The <hi rend='italic'>pan</hi> is a <hi rend='italic'>lajdak</hi>!</q>
the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly
and crossed one leg over the other. Mitya's eye was caught
<pb n='473'/><anchor id='Pg473'/>
by his huge greased boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of
both the Poles looked rather greasy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now it's <hi rend='italic'>lajdak</hi>! What's he scolding about?</q>
said Grushenka, suddenly vexed.
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Pani</hi> Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant
girls, and not ladies of good birth,</q> the Pole with the pipe
observed to Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can reckon on that,</q> the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
<q>What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It
makes it cheerful,</q> Grushenka said crossly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not hindering them, <hi rend='italic'>pani</hi>,</q> said the Pole in the wig,
with a long look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he
sucked his pipe again.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.</q> Kalganov got
excited again, as though it were a question of vast import. <q>He's
never been in Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you
weren't married in Poland, were you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought
her to Russia before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her
aunt, and another female relation with a grown-up son. He brought
her straight from Poland and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant
in our regiment, a very nice young man. At first he meant
to marry her himself. But he didn't marry her, because she turned
out to be lame.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So you married a lame woman?</q> cried Kalganov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed
it. I thought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I
thought it was for fun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So pleased she was going to marry you!</q> yelled Kalganov, in a
ringing, childish voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.
Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very
evening, she confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. <q>I
once jumped over a puddle when I was a child,</q> she said, <q>and injured
my leg.</q> He he!</q>
</p>

<p>
Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling
on the sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle
of happiness.
</p>

<pb n='474'/><anchor id='Pg474'/>

<p>
<q>Do you know, that's the truth, he's not lying now,</q> exclaimed
Kalganov, turning to Mitya; <q>and do you know, he's been married
twice; it's his first wife he's talking about. But his second wife, do
you know, ran away, and is alive now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it possible?</q> said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with
an expression of the utmost astonishment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. She did run away. I've had that unpleasant experience,</q>
Maximov modestly assented, <q>with a
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>monsieur</foreign>. And what was
worse, she'd had all my little property transferred to her beforehand.
<q>You're an educated man,</q> she said to me. <q>You can always
get your living.</q> She settled my business with that. A venerable
bishop once said to me: <q>One of your wives was lame, but the other
was too light-footed.</q> He he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, listen!</q> cried Kalganov, bubbling over, <q>if he's telling
lies&mdash;and he often is&mdash;he's only doing it to amuse us all. There's
no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He's
awfully low, but it's natural to him, eh? Don't you think so?
Some people are low from self-interest, but he's simply so, from
nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the
way yesterday) that Gogol wrote <hi rend='italic'>Dead Souls</hi> about him. Do you
remember, there's a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov
thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, <q>for inflicting
bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken
condition.</q> Would you believe it, he claims that he was that
Maximov and that he was beaten! Now can it be so? Tchitchikov
made his journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of the twenties,
so that the dates don't fit. He couldn't have been thrashed
then, he couldn't, could he?</q>
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but
his excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without
protest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, but if they did thrash him!</q> he cried, laughing.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is&mdash;</q>
put in Maximov.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What o'clock is it, <foreign rend='italic'>panie</foreign>?</q>
the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall
friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders
in reply. Neither of them had a watch.
</p>

<pb n='475'/><anchor id='Pg475'/>

<p>
<q>Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn't other people
talk because you're bored?</q> Grushenka flew at him with evident
intention of finding fault. Something seemed for the first time to
flash upon Mitya's mind. This time the Pole answered with unmistakable
irritability.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Pani</foreign>, I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right then. Come, tell us your story,</q> Grushenka cried to
Maximov. <q>Why are you all silent?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish,</q> answered Maximov at
once, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. <q>Besides, all that's
by way of allegory in Gogol, for he's made all the names have a
meaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had
