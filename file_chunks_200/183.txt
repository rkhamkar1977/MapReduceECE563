</p>

<p>
But now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one
terror at least was at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful
figure had vanished, leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had
turned into something so small, so comic; it had been carried into
the bedroom and locked in. It would never return. She was
ashamed, and from her eyes he could see now whom she loved.
Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not
go on living, he could not; oh, damnation! <q>O God! restore to life
the man I knocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass
from me! Lord, thou hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me!
But what, what if the old man's alive? Oh, then the shame of the
other disgrace I would wipe away. I would restore the stolen money.
I'd give it back; I'd get it somehow.... No trace of that shame
will remain except in my heart for ever! But no, no; oh, impossible
cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation!</q>
</p>

<p>
Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He
jumped up and ran back to the room&mdash;to her, to her, his queen for
ever! Was not one moment of her love worth all the rest of life,
even in the agonies of disgrace? This wild question clutched at his
heart. <q>To her, to her alone, to see her, to hear her, to think of
nothing, to forget everything, if only for that night, for an hour,
for a moment!</q> Just as he turned from the balcony into the passage,
he came upon the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch. He thought
he looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he had come to find him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir.</q> The landlord seemed disconcerted. <q>Why should I
be looking for you? Where have you been?</q>
</p>

<pb n='492'/><anchor id='Pg492'/>

<p>
<q>Why do you look so glum? You're not angry, are you? Wait
a bit, you shall soon get to bed.... What's the time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It'll be three o'clock. Past three, it must be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We'll leave off soon. We'll leave off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't mention it; it doesn't matter. Keep it up as long as you
like....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter with him?</q> Mitya wondered for an instant,
and he ran back to the room where the girls were dancing. But she
was not there. She was not in the blue room either; there was no
one but Kalganov asleep on the sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain&mdash;she
was there. She was sitting in the corner, on a trunk.
Bent forward, with her head and arms on the bed close by, she was
crying bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobs that she might not
be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, and when he ran
to her, she grasped his hand tightly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him
these five years, all that time! Did I love him or only my own
anger? No, him, him! It's a lie that it was my anger I loved and
not him. Mitya, I was only seventeen then; he was so kind to me,
so merry; he used to sing to me.... Or so it seemed to a silly
girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it's not the same man. Even
his face is not the same; he's different altogether. I shouldn't have
known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was
thinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we
should look at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden
it was just as though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me.
He talked to me like a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he
met me so solemnly that I was struck dumb. I couldn't get a word
in. At first I thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big
Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering why I couldn't say a
word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruined him;
you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed
him like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I'm ashamed,
I'm ashamed for all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five
years!</q>
</p>

<p>
And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya's hand
and did not let it go.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, darling, stay, don't go away. I want to say one word
<pb n='493'/><anchor id='Pg493'/>
to you,</q> she whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. <q>Listen,
tell me who it is I love? I love one man here. Who is that man?
That's what you must tell me.</q>
</p>

<p>
A smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and
her eyes shone in the half darkness.
</p>

<p>
<q>A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. <q>Fool! that's the man
you love!</q> That was what my heart whispered to me at once. You
came in and all grew bright. What's he afraid of? I wondered.
For you were frightened; you couldn't speak. It's not them he's
afraid of&mdash;could you be frightened of any one? It's me he's afraid
of, I thought, only me. So Fenya told you, you little stupid, how
I called to Alyosha out of the window that I'd loved Mityenka for
one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another. Mitya,
Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any one
after you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not?
Do you love me? Do you love me?</q> She jumped up and held him
with both hands on his shoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture,
gazed into her eyes, at her face, at her smile, and suddenly clasped
her tightly in his arms and kissed her passionately.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through
spite I tormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out
of his mind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house
one day and broke the wine-glass? I remembered that and I broke
a glass to-day and drank <q>to my vile heart.</q> Mitya, my falcon, why
don't you kiss me? He kissed me once, and now he draws back
and looks and listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me, kiss me hard,
that's right. If you love, well, then, love! I'll be your slave now,
your slave for the rest of my life. It's sweet to be a slave. Kiss
me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I
do deserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won't have that....</q>
she suddenly thrust him away. <q>Go along, Mitya, I'll come and have
some wine, I want to be drunk, I'm going to get drunk and dance;
I must, I must!</q> She tore herself away from him and disappeared
behind the curtain. Mitya followed like a drunken man.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, come what may&mdash;whatever may happen now, for one minute
I'd give the whole world,</q> he thought. Grushenka did, in fact,
toss off a whole glass of champagne at one gulp, and became at once
very tipsy. She sat down in the same chair as before, with a blissful
<pb n='494'/><anchor id='Pg494'/>
smile on her face. Her cheeks were glowing, her lips were burning,
her flashing eyes were moist; there was passionate appeal in her eyes.
Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heart and went up to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?</q>
she said thickly. <q>I'm drunk now, that's what it is.... And
aren't you drunk? And why isn't Mitya drinking? Why don't you
drink, Mitya? I'm drunk, and you don't drink....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am drunk! I'm drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and
now I'll be drunk with wine, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
He drank off another glass, and&mdash;he thought it strange himself&mdash;that
glass made him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although
till that moment he had been quite sober, he remembered
that. From that moment everything whirled about him, as though
he were delirious. He walked, laughed, talked to everybody, without
knowing what he was doing. Only one persistent burning sensation
made itself felt continually, <q>like a red-hot coal in his heart,</q> he
said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her, gazed at her,
listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept calling every
one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When
the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross
over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly
amused by the <q>little old man,</q> as she called Maximov. He ran up
every minute to kiss her hands, <q>each little finger,</q> and finally he
danced another dance to an old song, which he sang himself. He
danced with special vigor to the refrain:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>The little pig says&mdash;umph! umph! umph!</l>
<l>The little calf says&mdash;moo, moo, moo,</l>
<l>The little duck says&mdash;quack, quack, quack,</l>
<l>The little goose says&mdash;ga, ga, ga.</l>
<l>The hen goes strutting through the porch;</l>
<l>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say,</l>
<l>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say!</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
<q>Give him something, Mitya,</q> said Grushenka. <q>Give him a
present, he's poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do
you know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one
day, Alyosha said something to me to-day that I shall remember
all my life.... Yes.... But to-day let us dance. To-morrow
<pb n='495'/><anchor id='Pg495'/>
to the nunnery, but to-day we'll dance. I want to play to-day, good
people, and what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God, I'd
forgive every one: <q>My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive
you.</q> I'm going to beg forgiveness: <q>Forgive me, good people, a silly
wench.</q> I'm a beast, that's what I am. But I want to pray. I gave
a little onion. Wicked as I've been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them
dance, don't stop them. Every one in the world is good. Every one&mdash;even
the worst of them. The world's a nice place. Though we're
bad the world's all right. We're good and bad, good and bad....
Come, tell me, I've something to ask you: come here every one, and
I'll ask you: Why am I so good? You know I am good. I'm very
good.... Come, why am I so good?</q>
</p>

<p>
So Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At
last she announced that she was going to dance, too. She got up
from her chair, staggering. <q>Mitya, don't give me any more wine&mdash;if
I ask you, don't give it to me. Wine doesn't give peace. Everything's
going round, the stove, and everything. I want to dance.
Let every one see how I dance ... let them see how beautifully I
dance....</q>
</p>

<p>
She really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out
of her pocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave
it in the dance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got
ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov,
hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and
ran skipping about in front of her, humming:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>With legs so slim and sides so trim</l>
<l>And its little tail curled tight.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him
away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Sh-h! Mitya, why don't they come? Let every one come ...
to look on. Call them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did
you lock them in? Tell them I'm going to dance. Let them look
on, too....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and
began knocking to the Poles with his fist.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she's going to dance. She
calls you.</q>
</p>

<pb n='496'/><anchor id='Pg496'/>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Lajdak!</foreign></q> one of the Poles shouted in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>You're a <foreign rend='italic'>lajdak</foreign>
yourself! You're a little scoundrel, that's what
you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Leave off laughing at Poland,</q> said Kalganov sententiously. He
too was drunk.
</p>

<p>
<q>Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn't mean that
I called all Poland so. One <foreign rend='italic'>lajdak</foreign>
doesn't make a Poland. Be quiet,
my pretty boy, eat a sweetmeat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why won't
they make friends?</q> said Grushenka, and went forward to dance.
The chorus broke into <q>Ah, my porch, my new porch!</q> Grushenka
flung back her head, half opened her lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief,
and suddenly, with a violent lurch, stood still in the middle
of the room, looking bewildered.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm weak....</q> she said in an exhausted voice. <q>Forgive me....
I'm weak, I can't.... I'm sorry.</q>
</p>

<p>
She bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm sorry.... Forgive me....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The lady's been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,</q>
voices were heard saying.
</p>

<p>
<q>The lady's drunk too much,</q> Maximov explained to the girls,
giggling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, lead me away ... take me,</q> said Grushenka helplessly.
Mitya pounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the
precious burden through the curtains.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now I'll go,</q> thought Kalganov, and walking out of the
blue room, he closed the two halves of the door after him. But the
orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya
laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't touch me....</q> she faltered, in an imploring voice.
<q>Don't touch me, till I'm yours.... I've told you I'm yours, but
don't touch me ... spare me.... With them here, with them
close, you mustn't. He's here. It's nasty here....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll obey you! I won't think of it ... I worship you!</q> muttered
Mitya. <q>Yes, it's nasty here, it's abominable.</q>
</p>

<p>
And still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, though you're a brute, you're generous,</q> Grushenka
<pb n='497'/><anchor id='Pg497'/>
articulated with difficulty. <q>It must be honorable ... it shall be
honorable for the future ... and let us be honest, let us be good,
not brutes, but good ... take me away, take me far away, do you
hear? I don't want it to be here, but far, far away....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, yes, it must be!</q> said Mitya, pressing her in his arms.
<q>I'll take you and we'll fly away.... Oh, I'd give my whole life
for one year only to know about that blood!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What blood?</q> asked Grushenka, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing,</q> muttered Mitya, through his teeth. <q>Grusha, you
wanted to be honest, but I'm a thief. But I've stolen money from
Katya.... Disgrace, a disgrace!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn't steal it.
Give it her back, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now
everything of mine is yours. What does money matter? We shall
waste it anyway.... Folks like us are bound to waste money.
But we'd better go and work the land. I want to dig the earth with
my own hands. We must work, do you hear? Alyosha said so. I
won't be your mistress, I'll be faithful to you, I'll be your slave,
I'll work for you. We'll go to the young lady and bow down to
her together, so that she may forgive us, and then we'll go away.
And if she won't forgive us, we'll go, anyway. Take her her money
and love me.... Don't love her.... Don't love her any more.
If you love her, I shall strangle her.... I'll put out both her eyes
with a needle....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I love you. I love only you. I'll love you in Siberia....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don't care ...
we'll work ... there's snow in Siberia.... I love driving
in the snow ... and must have bells.... Do you hear, there's a
bell ringing? Where is that bell ringing? There are people coming....
Now it's stopped.</q>
</p>

<p>
She closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an
instant. There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance,
but the ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast.
He did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice
that the songs had ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken
clamor there was absolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>What's the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... I've
<pb n='498'/><anchor id='Pg498'/>
been asleep and dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and
I dozed. I was with some one I loved, with you. And far, far away.
I was holding you and kissing you, nestling close to you. I was
cold, and the snow glistened.... You know how the snow glistens
at night when the moon shines. It was as though I was not on
earth. I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. How sweet that
is!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Close to you,</q> murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom,
her hands. And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him
that she was looking straight before her, not at him, not into his
face, but over his head, with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An
expression of wonder, almost of alarm, came suddenly into her face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, who is that looking at us?</q> she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Mitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains
and seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone,
it seemed.
</p>

<p>
He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here, come to us, come here,</q> said a voice, speaking not loudly,
but firmly and peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still.
The room was filled with people, but not those who had been there
before. An instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered.
He recognized all those people instantly. That tall, stout
old man in the overcoat and forage-cap with a cockade&mdash;was the
police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And that <q>consumptive-looking</q>
trim dandy, <q>who always has such polished boots</q>&mdash;that was
the deputy prosecutor. <q>He has a chronometer worth four hundred
roubles; he showed it to me.</q> And that small young man in spectacles....
Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had
seen him: he was the <q>investigating lawyer,</q> from the <q>school of
jurisprudence,</q> who had only lately come to the town. And this
man&mdash;the inspector of police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he
knew well. And those fellows with the brass plates on, why are they
here? And those other two ... peasants.... And there at the
door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen! What's this for, gentlemen?</q> began Mitya, but
suddenly, as though beside himself, not knowing what he was doing,
he cried aloud, at the top of his voice:
</p>

<pb n='499'/><anchor id='Pg499'/>

<p>
<q>I un&mdash;der&mdash;stand!</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping
up to Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:
</p>

<p>
<q>We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this
way to the sofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should
give an explanation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The old man!</q> cried Mitya frantically. <q>The old man and his
blood!... I understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had
been mown down by a scythe.
</p>

<p>
<q>You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide!
Your father's blood cries out against you!</q> the old captain of police
roared suddenly, stepping up to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
He was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is impossible!</q> cried the small young man. <q>Mihail Makarovitch,
Mihail Makarovitch, this won't do!... I beg you'll allow
me to speak. I should never have expected such behavior from
you....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,</q> cried the captain
of police; <q>look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company
of a disreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his
hands.... It's delirium!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain
your feelings,</q> the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old
police captain, <q>or I shall be forced to resort to&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
But the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to
Mitya, and delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that
you are charged with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch
Karamazov, perpetrated this night....</q>
</p>

<p>
He said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something,
but though Mitya heard them he did not understand them.
He stared at them all with wild eyes.

<head>Book IX. The Preliminary Investigation</head>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter I. The Beginning Of Perhotin's Official Career</head>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the
strong locked gates of the widow Morozov's house, ended, of
course, by making himself heard. Fenya, who was still excited by
the fright she had had two hours before, and too much <q>upset</q> to
go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the
furious knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen him
drive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking
again, no one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the
house-porter, who had already waked up and gone out to the gate,
and began imploring him not to open it. But having questioned
Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he wanted to see Fenya on very
<q>important business,</q> the man made up his mind at last to open.
Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya's kitchen, but the girl begged
him to allow the house-porter to be present, <q>because of her misgivings.</q>
He began questioning her and at once learnt the most
vital fact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to
look for Grushenka, he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar,
and that when he returned, the pestle was not with him and his
hands were smeared with blood.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!</q>
Fenya kept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the
product of her disordered imagination. But although not <q>dripping,</q>
Pyotr Ilyitch had himself seen those hands stained with blood,
and had helped to wash them. Moreover, the question he had to
decide was not how soon the blood had dried, but where Dmitri
Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather, whether it really
<pb n='501'/><anchor id='Pg501'/>
was to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, and how he could satisfactorily ascertain.
Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this point, and though
he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away a conviction
that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his
father's house, and that therefore something must have happened
there.
</p>

<p>
<q>And when he came back,</q> Fenya added with excitement,
<q>I told him the whole story, and then I began asking him, <q>Why
have you got blood on your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?</q> and he
answered that that was human blood, and that he had just killed
some one. He confessed it all to me, and suddenly ran off like a
madman. I sat down and began thinking, where's he run off to
now like a madman? He'll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my
mistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was running
to his lodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov's shop, and saw him just
setting off, and there was no blood on his hands then.</q> (Fenya had
noticed this and remembered it.) Fenya's old grandmother confirmed
her evidence as far as she was capable. After asking some
further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch left the house, even more upset
and uneasy than he had been when he entered it.
</p>

<p>
The most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have
been to go straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, to find out whether anything
had happened there, and if so, what; and only to go to the
police captain, as Pyotr Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he had
satisfied himself of the fact. But the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch's
gates were strong, and he would have to knock again. His
acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of the slightest, and what
if, after he had been knocking, they opened to him, and nothing
had happened? Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way would
go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called
Perhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one
had killed him. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what
Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded more than anything in the world.
</p>

<p>
Yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he
stamped his foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not
to Fyodor Pavlovitch's but to Madame Hohlakov's. He decided
that if she denied having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand
roubles, he would go straight to the police captain, but if she
<pb n='502'/><anchor id='Pg502'/>
admitted having given him the money, he would go home and let
the matter rest till next morning.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood
of causing scandal by going at eleven o'clock at night to a
fashionable lady, a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from
her bed to ask her an amazing question, than by going to Fyodor
Pavlovitch. But that is just how it is, sometimes, especially in cases
like the present one, with the decisions of the most precise and
phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was by no means phlegmatic at
that moment. He remembered all his life how a haunting uneasiness
gradually gained possession of him, growing more and more painful
and driving him on, against his will. Yet he kept cursing himself,
of course, all the way for going to this lady, but <q>I will get to the
bottom of it, I will!</q> he repeated for the tenth time, grinding his
teeth, and he carried out his intention.
</p>

<p>
It was exactly eleven o'clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov's
house. He was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response
to his inquiry whether the lady was still up, the porter could
give no answer, except that she was usually in bed by that time.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you,
she'll receive you. If she won't, she won't.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The
footman was unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid.
Pyotr Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady
that an official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on
particular business, and that if it were not of the greatest importance
he would not have ventured to come. <q>Tell her in those words, in
those words exactly,</q> he asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
She went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame
Hohlakov herself was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep.
She had felt upset ever since Mitya's visit, and had a presentiment
that she would not get through the night without the sick headache
which always, with her, followed such excitement. She was surprised
on hearing the announcement from the maid. She irritably
declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit at such
an hour, of an <q>official living in the town,</q> who was a total stranger,
roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr Ilyitch
<pb n='503'/><anchor id='Pg503'/>
was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to
take another message in these very words:
</p>

<p>
<q>That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and
that Madame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she
refused to see him now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I plunged headlong,</q> he described it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message
again. Madame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little,
asked what he looked like, and learned that he was <q>very well
dressed, young and so polite.</q> We may note, parenthetically, that
Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking young man, and well aware
of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him. She
was in her dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a black shawl
over her shoulders. <q>The official</q> was asked to walk into the
drawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received
shortly before. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly
inquiring countenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began
at once with the question:
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you want?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning
our common acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,</q> Perhotin
began.
</p>

<p>
But he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady's face showed
signs of acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him
in a fury:
</p>

<p>
<q>How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?</q> she
cried hysterically. <q>How dare you, sir, how could you venture to
disturb a lady who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an
hour!... And to force yourself upon her to talk of a man who
came here, to this very drawing-room, only three hours ago, to
murder me, and went stamping out of the room, as no one would
go out of a decent house. Let me tell you, sir, that I shall lodge
a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass. Kindly leave me
at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, has he killed somebody else?</q> Madame Hohlakov asked
impulsively.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I'll explain
<pb n='504'/><anchor id='Pg504'/>
it all in a couple of words,</q> answered Perhotin, firmly. <q>At
five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles
from me, and I know for a fact he had no money. Yet at nine
o'clock, he came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes
in his hand, about two or three thousand roubles. His hands and
face were all covered with blood, and he looked like a madman.
When I asked him where he had got so much money, he answered
that he had just received it from you, that you had given him a sum
of three thousand to go to the gold-mines....</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov's face assumed an expression of intense and
painful excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good God! He must have killed his old father!</q> she cried,
clasping her hands. <q>I have never given him money, never! Oh,
run, run!... Don't say another word! Save the old man ... run
to his father ... run!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You
remember for a fact that you did not give him any money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I didn't, I didn't! I refused to give it him, for he could not
appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me,
but I slipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide
nothing from you now, that he positively spat at me. Can you
fancy that! But why are we standing? Ah, sit down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, I....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man
from an awful death!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if he has killed him already?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What
do you think we must do now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Meantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself,
facing him. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her
the history of the affair, that part of it at least which he had himself
witnessed. He described, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her
about the pestle. All these details produced an overwhelming effect
on the distracted lady, who kept uttering shrieks, and covering her
face with her hands....
</p>

<p>
<q>Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special
faculty, whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I've
looked at that awful man and always thought, that man will end by
<pb n='505'/><anchor id='Pg505'/>
murdering me. And now it's happened ... that is, if he hasn't
murdered me, but only his own father, it's only because the finger
of God preserved me, and what's more, he was ashamed to murder
me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon from the relics
of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck.... And to think
how near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him
and he stretched out his neck to me!... Do you know, Pyotr
Ilyitch (I think you said your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don't
believe in miracles, but that ikon and this unmistakable miracle with
me now&mdash;that shakes me, and I'm ready to believe in anything you
like. Have you heard about Father Zossima?... But I don't
know what I'm saying ... and only fancy, with the ikon on his
neck he spat at me.... He only spat, it's true, he didn't murder
me and ... he dashed away! But what shall we do, what must we
do now? What do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight
to the police captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do
what he thought fit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, he's an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I
know him. Of course, he's the person to go to. How practical
you are, Pyotr Ilyitch! How well you've thought of everything!
I should never have thought of it in your place!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,</q> observed
Pyotr Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously
anxious to escape as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady,
who would not let him say good-by and go away.
</p>

<p>
<q>And be sure, be sure,</q> she prattled on, <q>to come back and tell
me what you see there, and what you find out ... what comes to
light ... how they'll try him ... and what he's condemned to....
Tell me, we have no capital punishment, have we? But be
sure to come, even if it's at three o'clock at night, at four, at half-past
four.... Tell them to wake me, to wake me, to shake me,
if I don't get up.... But, good heavens, I shan't sleep! But wait,
hadn't I better come with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>N&mdash;no. But if you would write three lines with your own
hand, stating that you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it
might, perhaps, be of use ... in case it's needed....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure!</q> Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her
<pb n='506'/><anchor id='Pg506'/>
bureau. <q>And you know I'm simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness,
your good sense in such affairs. Are you in the service
here? I'm delighted to think that you're in the service here!</q>
</p>

<p>
And still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the
following lines:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
I've never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch
Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy), three thousand
roubles to-day. I've never given him money, never: That I
swear by all that's holy!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>K. Hohlakov.</hi>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
<q>Here's the note!</q> she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. <q>Go,
save him. It's a noble deed on your part!</q>
</p>

<p>
And she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She
ran out to accompany him to the passage.
</p>

<p>
<q>How grateful I am to you! You can't think how grateful I
am to you for having come to me, first. How is it I haven't met
you before? I shall feel flattered at seeing you at my house in
the future. How delightful it is that you are living here!...
Such precision! Such practical ability!... They must appreciate
you, they must understand you. If there's anything I can do,
believe me ... oh, I love young people! I'm in love with young
people! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering
country. Her one hope.... Oh, go, go!...</q>
</p>

<p>
But Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have
let him go so soon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable
impression on him, which had somewhat softened his anxiety
at being drawn into such an unpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we
all know. <q>She's by no means so elderly,</q> he thought, feeling
pleased, <q>on the contrary I should have taken her for her daughter.</q>
</p>

<p>
As for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young
man. <q>Such sense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day!
and all that with such manners and appearance! People say the
young people of to-day are no good for anything, but here's an
example!</q> etc. So she simply forgot this <q>dreadful affair,</q> and it
was only as she was getting into bed, that, suddenly recalling <q>how
near death she had been,</q> she exclaimed: <q>Ah, it is awful, awful!</q>
</p>

<p>
But she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.
</p>

<pb n='507'/><anchor id='Pg507'/>

<p>
I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant
details, if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by
no means elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the
foundation of the whole career of that practical and precise young
man. His story is remembered to this day with amazement in our
town, and I shall perhaps have something to say about it, when I
have finished my long history of the Brothers Karamazov.

<head>Chapter II. The Alarm</head>

<p>
Our police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired
lieutenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He
had only come to us three years previously, but had won general
esteem, chiefly because he <q>knew how to keep society together.</q>
He was never without visitors, and could not have got on without
them. Some one or other was always dining with him; he never sat
down to table without guests. He gave regular dinners, too, on
all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones. Though the
fare was not <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>recherché</foreign>,
it was abundant. The fish-pies were excellent,
and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.
</p>

<p>
The first room his guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room,
with pictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls,
an essential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor's billiard-room.
There was card-playing every evening at his house, if only
at one table. But at frequent intervals, all the society of our town,
with the mammas and young ladies, assembled at his house to dance.
Though Mihail Makarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone.
His widowed daughter lived with him, with her two unmarried
daughters, grown-up girls, who had finished their education. They
were of agreeable appearance and lively character, and though every
one knew they would have no dowry, they attracted all the young
men of fashion to their grandfather's house.
</p>

<p>
Mihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work,
though he performed his duties no worse than many others. To
speak plainly, he was a man of rather narrow education. His understanding
<pb n='508'/><anchor id='Pg508'/>
of the limits of his administrative power could not always
be relied upon. It was not so much that he failed to grasp certain
reforms enacted during the present reign, as that he made conspicuous
blunders in his interpretation of them. This was not from
any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for he was
always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,</q> he used
to say of himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the
fundamental principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation
of the serfs, and only picked it up, so to speak, from year to
year, involuntarily increasing his knowledge by practice. And yet
he was himself a landowner. Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that
he would meet some of Mihail Makarovitch's visitors there that
evening, but he didn't know which. As it happened, at that moment
the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district doctor, a young
man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg after taking a
brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist
at the police captain's. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was
really the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the prosecutor),
was rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined
to be consumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman. He
was vain and irritable, though he had a good intellect, and even a
kind heart. It seemed that all that was wrong with him was that
he had a better opinion of himself than his ability warranted. And
that made him seem constantly uneasy. He had, moreover, certain
higher, even artistic, leanings, towards psychology, for instance, a
special study of the human heart, a special knowledge of the criminal
and his crime. He cherished a grievance on this ground, considering
that he had been passed over in the service, and being firmly persuaded
that in higher spheres he had not been properly appreciated,
and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to give
up his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected
Karamazov case agitated him profoundly: <q>It was a case
that might well be talked about all over Russia.</q> But I am anticipating.
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer,
who had only come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting
in the next room with the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards
<pb n='509'/><anchor id='Pg509'/>
and wondered that all the gentlemen should, as though intentionally,
on the evening of <q>the crime</q> have been gathered together
at the house of the executive authority. Yet it was perfectly simple
and happened quite naturally.
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch's wife had had toothache for the last two days,
and he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor,
from the very nature of his being, could not spend an evening except
at cards. Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for
three days past to drop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch's, so
to speak casually, so as slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter,
Olga Mihailovna, by showing that he knew her secret, that he knew
it was her birthday, and that she was trying to conceal it on purpose,
so as not to be obliged to give a dance. He anticipated a great deal
of merriment, many playful jests about her age, and her being afraid
to reveal it, about his knowing her secret and telling everybody, and
so on. The charming young man was a great adept at such teasing;
the ladies had christened him <q>the naughty man,</q> and he seemed to
be delighted at the name. He was extremely well-bred, however, of
good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life
of pleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He
was short, and delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers
he always wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was
engaged in his official duties, he always became extraordinarily grave,
as though realizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations
laid upon him. He had a special gift for mystifying murderers and
other criminals of the peasant class during interrogation, and if he
did not win their respect, he certainly succeeded in arousing their
wonder.
</p>

<p>
Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the
police captain's. He saw instantly that every one knew. They
had positively thrown down their cards, all were standing up and
talking. Even Nikolay Parfenovitch had left the young ladies and
run in, looking strenuous and ready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was
met with the astounding news that old Fyodor Pavlovitch really had
been murdered that evening in his own house, murdered and robbed.
The news had only just reached them in the following manner.
</p>

<p>
Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked
senseless near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might
<pb n='510'/><anchor id='Pg510'/>
well have slept till morning after the draught she had taken. But,
all of a sudden she waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic
scream from Smerdyakov, who was lying in the next room unconscious.
That scream always preceded his fits, and always terrified
and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could never get accustomed to it.
She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov's room. But it
was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid beginning to
gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out
and was going to call her husband, but suddenly realized that when
she had got up, he was not beside her in bed. She ran back to the
bedstead and began groping with her hands, but the bed was really
empty. Then he must have gone out&mdash;where? She ran to the steps
and timidly called him. She got no answer, of course, but she caught
the sound of groans far away in the garden in the darkness. She
listened. The groans were repeated, and it was evident they came
from the garden.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!</q>
she thought distractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw
that the gate into the garden was open.
</p>

<p>
<q>He must be out there, poor dear,</q> she thought. She went up
to the gate and all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her
by name, <q>Marfa! Marfa!</q> in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lord, preserve us from harm!</q> Marfa Ignatyevna murmured,
and ran towards the voice, and that was how she found Grigory.
But she found him not by the fence where he had been knocked
down, but about twenty paces off. It appeared later, that he had
crawled away on coming to himself, and probably had been a long
time getting so far, losing consciousness several times. She noticed
at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed at the top
of her voice. Grigory was muttering incoherently:
</p>

<p>
<q>He has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream,
silly ... run ... fetch some one....</q>
</p>

<p>
But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master's
window was open and that there was a candle alight in the window,
she ran there and began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in
at the window, she saw a fearful sight. Her master was lying on
his back, motionless, on the floor. His light-colored dressing-gown
and white shirt were soaked with blood. The candle on the table
<pb n='511'/><anchor id='Pg511'/>
brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless dead face of Fyodor
Pavlovitch. Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from the window,
ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran headlong
by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna. Both
mother and daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa's
desperate and persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter.
Marfa, shrieking and screaming incoherently, managed to tell them
the main fact, and to beg for assistance. It happened that Foma
had come back from his wanderings and was staying the night with
them. They got him up immediately and all three ran to the scene
of the crime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered that
at about eight o'clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden,
and this was no doubt Grigory's scream, <q>Parricide!</q> uttered when
he caught hold of Mitya's leg.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some one person screamed out and then was silent,</q> Marya
Kondratyevna explained as she ran. Running to the place where
Grigory lay, the two women with the help of Foma carried him to
the lodge. They lighted a candle and saw that Smerdyakov was no
better, that he was writhing in convulsions, his eyes fixed in a
squint, and that foam was flowing from his lips. They moistened
Grigory's forehead with water mixed with vinegar, and the water
revived him at once. He asked immediately:
</p>

<p>
<q>Is the master murdered?</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this
time that not only the window, but also the door into the garden
was wide open, though Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week
locked himself in every night and did not allow even Grigory to
come in on any pretext. Seeing that door open, they were afraid to
go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch <q>for fear anything should happen afterwards.</q>
And when they returned to Grigory, the old man told
them to go straight to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ran
there and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain's.
She arrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story
came, not as his own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation,
by a witness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the
criminal (a theory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe
till that moment).
</p>

<p>
It was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector
<pb n='512'/><anchor id='Pg512'/>
of the town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter
Fyodor Pavlovitch's house and there to open an inquiry on the spot,
according to the regular forms, which I will not go into here. The
district doctor, a zealous man, new to his work, almost insisted on
accompanying the police captain, the prosecutor, and the investigating
lawyer.
</p>

<p>
I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite
dead, with his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with
the same weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And
immediately that weapon was found, Grigory, to whom all possible
medical assistance was at once given, described in a weak and breaking
voice how he had been knocked down. They began looking
with a lantern by the fence and found the brass pestle dropped in
a most conspicuous place on the garden path. There were no signs
of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying.
But by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a
big and thick envelope with the inscription: <q>A present of three
thousand roubles for my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.</q>
And below had been added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, <q>For my little
chicken.</q> There were three seals of red sealing-wax on the envelope,
but it had been torn open and was empty: the money had been removed.
They found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon,
with which the envelope had been tied up.

One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch's evidence made a great impression on
the prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea
that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak,
that he had resolved to do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken
the pistols, loaded them before him, written a letter, put it in his
pocket, etc. When Pyotr Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe
in it, threatened to tell some one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya
had answered grinning: <q>You'll be too late.</q> So they must make
haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before he really did shoot
himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's clear, that's clear!</q> repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.
<q>That's just the way with mad fellows like that: <q>I shall
kill myself to-morrow, so I'll make merry till I die!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited
the prosecutor more than ever.

<p>
<q>Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called
Olsufyev, gentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to
have his hair curled, and then, without even hiding the money,
carrying it almost in his hand in the same way, he went off to the
girls.</q>
</p>

<p>
All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the
formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took
time and so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe
the officer of the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov,
who had arrived in the town the morning before to get his pay.
He was instructed to avoid raising the alarm when he reached
Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the <q>criminal</q> till the
arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also witnesses for the
arrest, police constables, and so on. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch did as
he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no one but his
old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of his secret
business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the landlord
in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at once a
change in Trifon Borissovitch's face and voice. So neither Mitya
nor any one else knew that he was being watched. The box with
the pistols had been carried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in
a suitable place. Only after four o'clock, almost at sunrise, all the
officials, the police captain, the prosecutor, the investigating lawyer,
drove up in two carriages, each drawn by three horses. The doctor
remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch's to make a post-mortem next day
on the body. But he was particularly interested in the condition
of the servant, Smerdyakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually
for twenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest
to science,</q> he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as
they left they laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor
and the investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor's
saying that Smerdyakov could not outlive the night.
</p>

<p>
After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will
return to that moment of our tale at which we broke off.

<p>
And so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not
understanding what was said to him. Suddenly he got up,
flung up his hands, and shouted aloud:
</p>

<p>
<q>I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty of that blood! I'm not guilty
of my father's blood.... I meant to kill him. But I'm not guilty.
Not I.</q>
</p>

<p>
But he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind
the curtain and flung herself at the police captain's feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!</q> she cried, in a heartrending
voice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands
towards them. <q>He did it through me. I tortured him and drove
him to it. I tortured that poor old man that's dead, too, in my
wickedness, and brought him to this! It's my fault, mine first, mine
most, my fault!</q>
