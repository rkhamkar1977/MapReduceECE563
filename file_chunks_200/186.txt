with a cold smile. <q>But it's strange that you see such a vital difference.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel,
and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a
thief, it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don't
know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower
than a scoundrel, that's my conviction. Listen, I carry the money
about me a whole month, I may make up my mind to give it back
to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer, but I cannot make up
my mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day, and
every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month
I can't bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking,
is that right?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, that's not right, that I can quite understand, and that
I don't dispute,</q> answered the prosecutor with reserve. <q>And let
us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if
you will be so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that
you have still not told us, altogether we've asked you, why, in the
first place, you halved the money, squandering one half and hiding
the other? For what purpose exactly did you hide it, what did you
mean to do with that fifteen hundred? I insist upon that question,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, of course!</q> cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead;
<q>forgive me, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief
point, or you'd understand in a minute, for it's just the motive of
<pb n='556'/><anchor id='Pg556'/>
it that's the disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man,
my dead father. He was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna,
and I was jealous; I thought then that she was hesitating between me
and him. So I kept thinking every day, suppose she were to make
up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she were to leave off tormenting
me, and were suddenly to say to me, <q>I love you, not him; take
me to the other end of the world.</q> And I'd only forty copecks; how
could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I'd be lost. You
see, I didn't know her then, I didn't understand her, I thought she
wanted money, and that she wouldn't forgive my poverty. And so
I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it
up, calculating on it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had
sewn it up, I went off to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base.
Do you understand now?</q>
</p>

<p>
Both the lawyers laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to
have squandered it all,</q> chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, <q>for after
all what does it amount to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to! Oh, God, you
horrify me by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen
hundred sewn up round my neck, every day and every hour I said
to myself, <q>You're a thief! you're a thief!</q> Yes, that's why I've been
so savage all this month, that's why I fought in the tavern, that's
why I attacked my father, it was because I felt I was a thief. I
couldn't make up my mind, I didn't dare even to tell Alyosha, my
brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel
and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried it I said
to myself at the same time every hour: <q>No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
you may yet not be a thief.</q> Why? Because I might go next day
and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday
I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from
Fenya's to Perhotin. I hadn't been able till that moment to bring
myself to it. And it was only when I tore it off that I became a
downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life.
Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to
Katya and saying, <q>I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief!</q> Do you understand
now? Do you understand?</q>
</p>

<pb n='557'/><anchor id='Pg557'/>

<p>
<q>What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?</q> Nikolay
Parfenovitch interrupted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to
die at five o'clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made
no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see
it's not so, it turns out that it does make a difference. Believe me,
gentlemen, what has tortured me most during this night has not
been the thought that I'd killed the old servant, and that I was in
danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded, and Heaven
was open to me again. Oh, that did torture me, but not in the same
way: not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that
damned money off my breast at last and spent it, and had become a
downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you again, with a bleeding
heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I have learnt that it's
not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but impossible to die a
scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in
spite of his being intensely excited.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> the
prosecutor said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone.
<q>But all this, if you'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves,
in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves, that's what it is.
And why, for instance, should you not have saved yourself such
misery for almost a month, by going and returning that fifteen
hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you? And why could
you not have explained things to her, and in view of your position,
which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had
recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to
one's mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her,
why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for
your expenses, which, with her generous heart, she would certainly
not have refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with
some guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant
Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I suppose you still
regard that security as of value?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya suddenly crimsoned.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as
that? You can't be speaking in earnest?</q> he said, with indignation,
<pb n='558'/><anchor id='Pg558'/>
looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to
believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you I'm in earnest.... Why do you imagine I'm not
serious?</q> It was the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know,
you are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I'll
confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and
you'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which
a medley of human passions can sink. You must know that I already
had that plan myself, that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor!
Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this
current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya&mdash;I
was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to tell her of my
treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out, for the expenses
of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to beg,
do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the
other, the rival, who hated and insulted her&mdash;to think of it! You
must be mad, prosecutor!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ...
of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this
case, as you assert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,</q>
said the prosecutor, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>But that would have been so infamous!</q> Mitya brought his
fist down on the table fiercely. <q>That would have been filthy beyond
everything! Yes, do you know that she might have given me
that money, yes, and she would have given it, too; she'd have been
certain to give it, to be revenged on me, she'd have given it to
satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me, for hers is an
infernal nature, too, and she's a woman of great wrath. I'd have
taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have
taken it, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive
me, gentlemen, I'm making such an outcry because I've had that
thought in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday, that
night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards
yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened ...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till what happened?</q> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively,
but Mitya did not hear it.
</p>

<pb n='559'/><anchor id='Pg559'/>

<p>
<q>I have made you an awful confession,</q> Mitya said gloomily in
conclusion. <q>You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must
respect it, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then you've
simply no respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die
of shame at having confessed it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot
myself! Yes, I see, I see already that you don't believe me. What,
you want to write that down, too?</q> he cried in dismay.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, what you said just now,</q> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking
at him in surprise, <q>that is, that up to the last hour you were still
contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from
her.... I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence
for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and
particularly for you, particularly important for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have mercy, gentlemen!</q> Mitya flung up his hands. <q>Don't
write that, anyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart
asunder before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering
the wounds in both halves.... Oh, my God!</q>
</p>

<p>
In despair he hid his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q> observed the
prosecutor, <q>everything that is written down will be read over to
you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you like.
But now I'll ask you one little question for the second time. Has no
one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed
up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to believe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one, no one, I told you so before, or you've not understood
anything! Let me alone!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's
plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a
dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted
almost everywhere about the three thousand you'd spent here;
three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you got
hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to
understand that you had brought three thousand with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred
witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!</q>
cried Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word <emph>all</emph> means
something.</q>
</p>

<pb n='560'/><anchor id='Pg560'/>

<p>
<q>It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what need had you to <q>talk rot,</q> as you call it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted
so much money.... To try and forget that money I had sewn
up, perhaps ... yes, that was why ... damn it ... how often
will you ask me that question? Well, I told a fib, and that was
the end of it, once I'd said it, I didn't care to correct it. What does
a man tell lies for sometimes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes
a man tell lies,</q> observed the prosecutor impressively. <q>Tell me,
though, was that <q>amulet,</q> as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not big.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How big, for instance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the
size.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them
somewhere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck?
According to your own evidence you didn't go home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I
tore it off my neck and took out the money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the dark?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in
one minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Without scissors, in the street?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an
old rag. It was torn in a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did you put it afterwards?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I dropped it there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where was it, exactly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows
whereabouts. What do you want to know for?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would
be material evidence in your favor. How is it you don't understand
that? Who helped you to sew it up a month ago?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one helped me. I did it myself.</q>
</p>

<pb n='561'/><anchor id='Pg561'/>

<p>
<q>Can you sew?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed
to do that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you
sewed the money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you laughing at me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know where I got the rag from&mdash;somewhere, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should have thought you couldn't have forgotten it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word, I don't remember. I might have torn a bit off
my linen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow
the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag.
What sort of rag was it, cloth or linen?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe
I didn't tear it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe
I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady's.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In your landlady's cap?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. I took it from her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How did you get it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to
wipe my pen on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless
rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it.
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece of
calico, washed a thousand times.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you remember that for certain now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap.
But, hang it, what does it matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was
lost?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you,
an old rag not worth a farthing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And where did you get the needle and thread?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!</q> said Mitya,
losing his temper at last.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where
you threw the pieces in the market-place.</q>
</p>

<pb n='562'/><anchor id='Pg562'/>

<p>
<q>Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and
perhaps you'll find it,</q> said Mitya, sneering. <q>Enough, gentlemen,
enough!</q> he decided, in an exhausted voice. <q>I see you don't believe
me! Not for a moment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not to
have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing
my secret to you? It's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes.
You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a hymn of triumph if you
can.... Damn you, you torturers!</q>
</p>

<p>
He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were
silent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost
vacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and
he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was
happening. In the meantime they had to finish what they were
about. They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It
was by now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had been
extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who
had been continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation
had been going on, had now both gone out again. The
lawyers, too, looked very tired. It was a wretched morning, the
whole sky was overcast, and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls.
Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
</p>

<p>
<q>May I look out of the window?</q> he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch,
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, as much as you like,</q> the latter replied.
</p>

<p>
Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed
against its little greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just
below the house, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of
poor, black, dismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the
rain. Mitya thought of <q>Phœbus the golden-haired,</q> and how he
had meant to shoot himself at his first ray. <q>Perhaps it would be
even better on a morning like this,</q> he thought with a smile, and
suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his <q>torturers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he cried, <q>I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me
about her, I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me?
She's innocent, you know, she was out of her mind when she cried
last night <q>It's all my fault!</q> She's done nothing, nothing! I've
been grieving over her all night as I sat with you.... Can't you,
won't you tell me what you are going to do with her now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='563'/><anchor id='Pg563'/>

<p>
<q>You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri
Fyodorovitch,</q> the prosecutor answered at once, with evident
alacrity. <q>We have, so far, no grounds for interfering with the
lady in whom you are so interested. I trust that it may be the same
in the later development of the case.... On the contrary, we'll do
everything that lies in our power in that matter. Set your mind
completely at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward
people in spite of everything. You've taken a load off my
heart.... Well, what are we to do now? I'm ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the
witnesses without delay. That must be done in your presence and
therefore&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't we have some tea first?</q> interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch,
<q>I think we've deserved it!</q>
</p>

<p>
They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch
had, no doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a
glass and then <q>go on and on,</q> putting off their proper breakfast
until a more favorable opportunity. Tea really was ready below,
and was soon brought up. Mitya at first refused the glass that
Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him, but afterwards he asked
for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked surprisingly exhausted.
It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength
that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent
emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he
could hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects
about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. <q>A little
more and I shall begin raving,</q> he said to himself.

<head>Chapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The Babe</head>

<p>
The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue
our story in such detail as before. And so we will not
dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness
called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and
<pb n='564'/><anchor id='Pg564'/>
conscience, and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence
on oath, how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of
his evidence, and so on. We will only note that the point principally
insisted upon in the examination was the question of the
three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here, at Mokroe,
by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand or
fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen
hundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned
out to be against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some
witnesses introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of
his, Mitya's, story.
</p>

<p>
The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not
in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the
contrary, an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused,
which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity.
He spoke little, and with reserve, waited to be questioned, answered
precisely and deliberately. Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness
that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than
three thousand, that all the peasants about here would testify that
they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by Dmitri
Fyodorovitch himself. <q>What a lot of money he flung away on
the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them
alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't believe I gave them five hundred,</q> was Mitya's gloomy
comment on this. <q>It's a pity I didn't count the money at the
time, but I was drunk....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He
listened gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though
he would say:
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly. <q>You flung it about at random
and they picked it up. They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers,
they've been driven away from here, or maybe they'd bear
witness themselves how much they got from you. I saw the sum
in your hands, myself&mdash;count it I didn't, you didn't let me, that's
true enough&mdash;but by the look of it I should say it was far more than
<pb n='565'/><anchor id='Pg565'/>
fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! We've seen money
too. We can judge of amounts....</q>
</p>

<p>
As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had told him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three
thousand with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?</q> replied Mitya.
<q>Surely I didn't declare so positively that I'd brought three thousand?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey.
Andrey himself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when
you were treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you
would leave your sixth thousand here&mdash;that is with what you spent
before, we must understand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and
Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too, was standing beside you at the time.
Maybe he'd remember it....</q>
</p>

<p>
The evidence as to the <q>sixth</q> thousand made an extraordinary
impression on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new
mode of reckoning; three and three made six, three thousand then
and three now made six, that was clear.
</p>

<p>
They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch,
Stepan and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The
peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch's
evidence. They noted down, with particular care, Andrey's
account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the road:
<q><q>Where,</q> says he, <q>am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going, to heaven or
to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle
smile, and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where
Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be <q>included in the case.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored,
and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met
them before in his life, though they were acquaintances whom he
had been meeting every day for a long time past. He began by
saying that <q>he knew nothing about it and didn't want to.</q> But it
appeared that he had heard of the <q>sixth</q> thousand, and he admitted
that he had been standing close by at the moment. As far
as he could see he <q>didn't know</q> how much money Mitya had in his
<pb n='566'/><anchor id='Pg566'/>
hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply
to reiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned
out, Mitya's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved,
and that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of
Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect, as though she
had been a lady of the best society, and did not once allow himself
to call her Grushenka. In spite of the young man's obvious repugnance
at giving evidence, Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great
length, and only from him learnt all the details of what made up
Mitya's <q>romance,</q> so to say, on that night. Mitya did not once
pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go, and he left
the room with unconcealed indignation.
</p>

<p>
The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed
in their room, they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of
the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that
they would certainly be sent for. They gave their evidence with
dignity, though not without some uneasiness. The little Pole turned
out to be a retired official of the twelfth class, who had served in
Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name was Mussyalovitch. Pan
Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist. Although
Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room
they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was
standing on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most
important person and in command, and addressed him at every word
as <q>Pan Colonel.</q> Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch
himself, they grasped that they had to address their answers
to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It turned out that they could speak
Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words. Of
his relations with Grushenka, past and present, Pan Mussyalovitch
spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at once and
declared that he would not allow the <q>scoundrel</q> to speak like that
in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the
word <q>scoundrel</q> and begged that it should be put down in the
protocol. Mitya fumed with rage.
</p>

<p>
<q>He's a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And
put down, too, that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he's
a scoundrel!</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he
<pb n='567'/><anchor id='Pg567'/>
showed the most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly
reprimanding Mitya, he cut short all further inquiry into the
romantic aspect of the case, and hastened to pass to what was
essential. One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special
interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very room, Mitya had
tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him three thousand
roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down, and
the remaining two thousand three hundred <q>to be paid next day
in the town.</q> He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole
sum with him at Mokroe, but that his money was in the town.
Mitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure
to pay him the remainder next day in the town. But Pan Vrublevsky
confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after thinking for a moment
admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the Poles stated,
that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have said so.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It
seemed to establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base
this deduction on it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that
had come into Mitya's hands might really have been left somewhere
hidden in the town, or even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe.
This would explain the circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution,
that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya's hands.
This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which, insignificant
as it was, had hitherto told, to some extent, in Mitya's
favor. Now this one piece of evidence in his favor had broken
down. In answer to the prosecutor's inquiry, where he would have
got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he
himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently
replied that he had meant to offer the <q>little chap,</q> not
money, but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village
of Tchermashnya, those rights which he had already offered to
Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov. The prosecutor positively smiled
at the <q>innocence of this subterfuge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute
for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He certainly would have accepted it,</q> Mitya declared warmly.
<q>Why, look here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four
or six, for it. He would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on
<pb n='568'/><anchor id='Pg568'/>
to the job, and might have got, not three thousand, but the whole
property out of the old man.</q>
</p>

<p>
The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the
protocol in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The
incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay
Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them, as it was, and did not
want to worry them with trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a
foolish, drunken quarrel over cards. There had been drinking and
disorder enough, that night.... So the two hundred roubles remained
in the pockets of the Poles.
</p>

<p>
Then old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached
with little steps, looking very disheveled and depressed.
He had, all this time, taken refuge below with Grushenka, sitting
dumbly beside her, and <q>now and then he'd begin blubbering over
her and wiping his eyes with a blue check handkerchief,</q> as Mihail
Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she herself began trying
to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once confessed that he
had done wrong, that he had borrowed <q>ten roubles in my poverty,</q>
from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.
To Nikolay Parfenovitch's direct question, had he noticed how
much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have
been able to see the sum better than any one when he took the note
from him, Maximov, in the most positive manner, declared that there
was twenty thousand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?</q>
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged
my little property. She'd only let me look at it from a distance,
boasting of it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored
notes. And Dmitri Fyodorovitch's were all rainbow-colored....</q>
</p>

<p>
He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka's turn. Nikolay
Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance
might have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition
to him, but Mitya bowed his head in silence, giving him to
understand <q>that he would not make a scene.</q> Mihail Makarovitch
himself led Grushenka in. She entered with a stern and gloomy
face, that looked almost composed and sat down quietly on the
<pb n='569'/><anchor id='Pg569'/>
chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very pale, she
seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent
black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish chill&mdash;the
first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her
grave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very
favorable impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even
a little bit <q>fascinated.</q> He admitted himself, when talking about
it afterwards, that only then had he seen <q>how handsome the woman
was,</q> for, though he had seen her several times before, he had always
looked upon her as something of a <q>provincial hetaira.</q> <q>She
has the manners of the best society,</q> he said enthusiastically, gossiping
about her in a circle of ladies. But this was received with positive
indignation by the ladies, who immediately called him a
<q>naughty man,</q> to his great satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
As she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant
at Mitya, who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him
at once. After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay
Parfenovitch asked her, hesitating a little, but preserving the most
courteous manner, on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov. To this Grushenka firmly and
quietly replied:
</p>

<p>
<q>He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance
during the last month.</q> To further inquisitive questions she answered
plainly and with complete frankness, that, though <q>at times</q>
she had thought him attractive, she had not loved him, but had won
his heart as well as his old father's <q>in my nasty spite,</q> that she had
seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every
one else; but that had only amused her. She had never meant to go
to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been laughing at him. <q>I
had no thoughts for either of them all this last month. I was expecting
another man who had wronged me. But I think,</q> she said
in conclusion, <q>that there's no need for you to inquire about that,
nor for me to answer you, for that's my own affair.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He
again dismissed the <q>romantic</q> aspect of the case and passed to the
serious one, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning
the three thousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the statement
that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first
<pb n='570'/><anchor id='Pg570'/>
carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had not counted the money
herself, she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri
Fyodorovitch's own lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you
only hear him speak of it to others in your presence?</q> the prosecutor
inquired immediately.
</p>

<p>
To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before
other people, and had heard him say so when they were alone.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?</q> inquired the
prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.
</p>

<p>
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too,
where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had got it from Katerina Ivanovna.
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month
ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch
had saved half that sum for his own use?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never heard that,</q> answered Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often
told her that he hadn't a farthing.
</p>

<p>
<q>He was always expecting to get some from his father,</q> said
Grushenka in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of
irritation,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, <q>that he intended
to make an attempt on his father's life?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, he did say so,</q> sighed Grushenka.
</p>

<p>
<q>Once or several times?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He mentioned it several times, always in anger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And did you believe he would do it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never believed it,</q> she answered firmly. <q>I had faith in
his noble heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, allow me,</q> cried Mitya suddenly, <q>allow me to say
one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You can speak,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.
</p>

<p>
<q>Agrafena Alexandrovna!</q> Mitya got up from his chair, <q>have
faith in God and in me. I am not guilty of my father's murder!</q>
</p>

<p>
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair.
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon.
<pb n='571'/><anchor id='Pg571'/>
<q>Thanks be to Thee, O Lord,</q> she said, in a voice thrilled with
emotion, and still standing, she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and
added:
</p>

<p>
<q>As he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. He'll say anything
as a joke or from obstinacy, but he'll never deceive you against
his conscience. He's telling the whole truth, you may believe it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you've given me fresh courage,</q>
Mitya responded in a quivering voice.
</p>

<p>
As to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she
did not know what sum it was, but had heard him tell several people
that he had three thousand with him. And to the question where he
got the money, she said that he had told her that he had <q>stolen</q>
it from Katerina Ivanovna, and that she had replied to that that
he hadn't stolen it, and that he must pay the money back next day.
On the prosecutor's asking her emphatically whether the money
he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent
yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, she declared
that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that
was how she understood him.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed
her impulsively that she might at once return to the town
and that if he could be of any assistance to her, with horses for
example, or if she would care for an escort, he ... would be&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you sincerely,</q> said Grushenka, bowing to him, <q>I'm
going with this old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with
me, and meanwhile, if you'll allow me, I'll wait below to hear what
you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful,
but only for a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a
strange physical weakness. His eyes were closing with fatigue.
The examination of the witnesses was, at last, over. They proceeded
to a final revision of the protocol. Mitya got up, moved
from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large
chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place
and the time.
</p>

<p>
He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been
stationed long ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a
<pb n='572'/><anchor id='Pg572'/>
pair of horses, through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in
November, and the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as
soon as it touched the earth. And the peasant drove him smartly,
he had a fair, long beard. He was not an old man, somewhere about
fifty, and he had on a gray peasant's smock. Not far off was a
village, he could see the black huts, and half the huts were burnt
down, there were only the charred beams sticking up. And as
they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road,
a lot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a
sort of brownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman,
who looked forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long
thin face. And in her arms was a little baby crying. And her
breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in
them. And the child cried and cried, and held out its little bare
arms, with its little fists blue from cold.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are they crying? Why are they crying?</q> Mitya asked, as
they dashed gayly by.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's the babe,</q> answered the driver, <q>the babe weeping.</q>
</p>

<p>
And Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, <q>the
babe,</q> and he liked the peasant's calling it a <q>babe.</q> There seemed
more pity in it.
</p>

<p>
<q>But why is it weeping?</q> Mitya persisted stupidly, <q>why are its
little arms bare? Why don't they wrap it up?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The babe's cold, its little clothes are frozen and don't warm it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why is it? Why?</q> foolish Mitya still persisted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, they're poor people, burnt out. They've no bread. They're
begging because they've been burnt out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no,</q> Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. <q>Tell me
why it is those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor?
Why is the babe poor? Why is the steppe barren? Why don't they
hug each other and kiss? Why don't they sing songs of joy? Why
are they so dark from black misery? Why don't they feed the
babe?</q>
</p>

<p>
And he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and
senseless, yet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in
that way. And he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never
known before, was rising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that
he wanted to do something for them all, so that the babe should
<pb n='573'/><anchor id='Pg573'/>
weep no more, so that the dark-faced, dried-up mother should not
weep, that no one should shed tears again from that moment, and
he wanted to do it at once, at once, regardless of all obstacles, with
all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.
</p>

<p>
<q>And I'm coming with you. I won't leave you now for the rest
of my life, I'm coming with you,</q> he heard close beside him
Grushenka's tender voice, thrilling with emotion. And his heart
glowed, and he struggled forward towards the light, and he longed
to live, to live, to go on and on, towards the new, beckoning light,
and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!
</p>

<p>
<q>What! Where?</q> he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up
on the chest, as though he had revived from a swoon, smiling
brightly. Nikolay Parfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting
that he should hear the protocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya
guessed that he had been asleep an hour or more, but he did not hear
Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was suddenly struck by the fact that
there was a pillow under his head, which hadn't been there when he
had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?</q> he
cried, with a sort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as
though some great kindness had been shown him.
</p>

<p>
He never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the
peasant witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch's little secretary, had
compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head; but his
whole soul was quivering with tears. He went to the table and said
that he would sign whatever they liked.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've had a good dream, gentlemen,</q> he said in a strange voice,
with a new light, as of joy, in his face.
</p>

<head>Chapter IX. They Carry Mitya Away</head>

<p>
When the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch
turned solemnly to the prisoner and read him the <q>Committal,</q>
setting forth, that in such a year, on such a day, in such
a place, the investigating lawyer of such-and-such a district court,
<pb n='574'/><anchor id='Pg574'/>
having examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya) accused of this and of
that (all the charges were carefully written out) and having considered
that the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges made
against him, had brought forward nothing in his defense, while the
witnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such
testify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such
articles of the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order
to preclude so-and-so (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit
and judgment he be detained in such-and-such a prison, which he
hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this
same <q>Committal</q> to the deputy prosecutor, and so on, and so on.
</p>

<p>
In brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a
prisoner, and that he would be driven at once to the town, and there
shut up in a very unpleasant place. Mitya listened attentively, and
only shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, gentlemen, I don't blame you. I'm ready.... I understand
that there's nothing else for you to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be
escorted at once by the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch,
who happened to be on the spot....
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay,</q> Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable
feeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, we're all cruel, we're all monsters, we all make men
weep, and mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be
settled here, now, of all I am the lowest reptile! I've sworn to
amend, and every day I've done the same filthy things. I understand
now that such men as I need a blow, a blow of destiny to
catch them as with a noose, and bind them by a force from without.
Never, never should I have risen of myself! But the thunderbolt
has fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my public shame,
I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps I shall
be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am not
guilty of my father's blood. I accept my punishment, not because
I killed him, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps I really
might have killed him. Still I mean to fight it out with you. I
warn you of that. I'll fight it out with you to the end, and then
God will decide. Good-by, gentlemen, don't be vexed with me for
having shouted at you during the examination. Oh, I was still
<pb n='575'/><anchor id='Pg575'/>
such a fool then.... In another minute I shall be a prisoner, but
now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri Karamazov offers you
his hand. Saying good-by to you, I say it to all men.</q>
</p>

<p>
His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay
Parfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden,
almost nervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya
instantly noticed this, and started. He let his outstretched hand
fall at once.
</p>

<p>
<q>The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,</q> Nikolay Parfenovitch
faltered, somewhat embarrassed. <q>We will continue it in the town,
and I, for my part, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in
your defense.... As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
I've always been disposed to regard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate
than guilty. All of us here, if I may make bold to speak
for all, we are all ready to recognize that you are, at bottom, a young
man of honor, but, alas, one who has been carried away by certain
passions to a somewhat excessive degree....</q>
</p>

<p>
Nikolay Parfenovitch's little figure was positively majestic by
the time he had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another
minute this <q>boy</q> would take his arm, lead him to another corner,
and renew their conversation about <q>girls.</q> But many quite irrelevant
and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner
when he is being led out to execution.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see <emph>her</emph> to say
<q>good-by</q> for the last time?</q> asked Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it's impossible except
in the presence of&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few
words, and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka
made a deep bow to Mitya.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow
you for ever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless,
though you've been your own undoing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my
love.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went
<pb n='576'/><anchor id='Pg576'/>
out. He was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch
on him. At the bottom of the steps to which he had driven up
with such a dash the day before with Andrey's three horses, two
carts stood in readiness. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set
man with a wrinkled face, was annoyed about something, some
sudden irregularity. He was shouting angrily. He asked Mitya
to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.
</p>

<p>
<q>When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a
different face,</q> thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was
a crowd of people, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch
came down the steps too. All stared at Mitya.
