but for its being left on the floor, no one in the world would have
known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it, and
therefore of the prisoner's having stolen it. And so that torn scrap
of paper is, by the prosecutor's own admission, the sole proof on
which the charge of robbery rests, <q>otherwise no one would have
known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.</q> But is the
mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof
that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?
Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the
envelope. But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask
you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen
the notes two days before the catastrophe. Then why not imagine
that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient and
hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration, may have
whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out
the notes. <q>What's the use of the envelope?</q> he may have asked
himself. <q>She won't believe the notes are there, but when I show
her the thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more
impression, you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.</q> And
so he tears open the envelope, takes out the money, and flings the
envelope on the floor, conscious of being the owner and untroubled
by any fears of leaving evidence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this
theory and such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if
anything of the sort could have taken place, the charge of robbery
falls to the ground; if there was no money, there was no theft of it.
If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had
been money in it, why may I not maintain the opposite, that the
envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it
by its owner?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch
<pb n='827'/><anchor id='Pg827'/>
took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the
police searched the house? In the first place, part of the money
was found in the cash-box, and secondly, he might have taken it
out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of
it, to give or send it away; he may have changed his idea, his plan
of action completely, without thinking it necessary to announce the
fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is the barest possibility
of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so positively
accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and
of having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on
the domain of romance. If it is maintained that something has
been stolen, the thing must be produced, or at least its existence
must be proved beyond doubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly
more than a boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger,
went in broad daylight into a moneychanger's shop with an ax, and
with extraordinary, typical audacity killed the master of the shop
and carried off fifteen hundred roubles. Five hours later he was
arrested, and, except fifteen roubles he had already managed to spend,
the whole sum was found on him. Moreover, the shopman, on his
return to the shop after the murder, informed the police not only
of the exact sum stolen, but even of the notes and gold coins of
which that sum was made up, and those very notes and coins were
found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and genuine
confession on the part of the murderer. That's what I call evidence,
gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch
the money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present
case? And yet it is a question of life and death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering
money; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles&mdash;where
did he get the money? But the very fact that only fifteen
hundred could be found, and the other half of the sum could nowhere
be discovered, shows that that money was not the same, and
had never been in any envelope. By strict calculation of time it
was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight
from those women servants to Perhotin's without going home, and
that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in company
and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and
<pb n='828'/><anchor id='Pg828'/>
hidden half in the town. It's just this consideration that has led the
prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at
Mokroe. Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen?
Isn't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic?
And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the whole charge of
robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case what could have
become of the other fifteen hundred roubles? By what miracle could
they have disappeared, since it's proved the prisoner went nowhere
else? And we are ready to ruin a man's life with such tales!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the
fifteen hundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without
money before that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner
has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that
money, and if you will have it so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing
can be more probable than that statement, and more consistent with
the temper and spirit of the prisoner. The prosecutor is charmed
with his own romance. A man of weak will, who had brought
himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his
betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it
up, but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two
days and taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a
month. All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone
that brooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened
quite differently? What if you've been weaving a romance, and
about quite a different kind of man? That's just it, you have
invented quite a different man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on
one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month
before the catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half.
But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been
shown in court already. Besides, in another man's hand a crust
always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that
money; they all judged simply at sight. And the witness Maximov
has testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his hand. You
see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two-edged weapon. Let
me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by
Katerina Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post.
<pb n='829'/><anchor id='Pg829'/>
But the question is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in
such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now?
The first statement made by the young lady on the subject was different,
perfectly different. In the second statement we heard only
cries of resentment and revenge, cries of long-concealed hatred.
And the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly,
gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of evidence
may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare
not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch
on it either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and
high-principled person, such as that highly respected young lady
unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in
court to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive
of ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given
not impartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that
a revengeful woman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may
well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult and humiliation of
her offering him the money. No, it was offered in such a way that
it was possible to take it, especially for a man so easy-going as the
prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive shortly from his father
the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was owing to him. It
was unreflecting of him, but it was just his irresponsible want of
reflection that made him so confident that his father would give him
the money, that he would get it, and so could always dispatch the
money entrusted to him and repay the debt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day
have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That's
not his character, he tells us, he couldn't have had such feelings.
But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried
out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at
once. Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature, fluctuating between
two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent
craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if something
strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is love&mdash;that
new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he
needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress.
If she were to say to him, <q>I am yours, I won't have Fyodor Pavlovitch,</q>
then he must have money to take her away. That was more
<pb n='830'/><anchor id='Pg830'/>
important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand
it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from&mdash;what is
there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in
case of emergency?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner
the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that
he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner,
loved. <q>If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn't give the money,</q> he thought,
<q>I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina
Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried
round his neck, and say, <q>I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.</q>
So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that
sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he shouldn't unpick the
little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why should you
deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of honor,
granted that it's misplaced, granted it's often mistaken, yet it exists
and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments
reach a climax, and those same two questions torture his
fevered brain more and more: <q>If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where
can I find the means to go off with Grushenka?</q> If he behaved
wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the taverns in the course
of that month, it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained
beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions became so
acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his younger
brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles, but
without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating
the old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect
of getting it from any one; his father would not give it him
after that beating.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the
upper part of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his
brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still
he would remain a scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use
that means, that he wouldn't have the character, that he wouldn't
have the will-power to do it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse
to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so genuinely
<pb n='831'/><anchor id='Pg831'/>
and sincerely, so spontaneously and convincingly? And why, on the
contrary, does he force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice,
in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner
wrote that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous
proof of the prisoner having committed robbery! <q>I shall
beg from every one, and if I don't get it I shall murder my father
and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under
his mattress as soon as Ivan has gone.</q> A full program of the murder,
we are told, so it must have been he. <q>It has all been done as he
wrote,</q> cries the prosecutor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and written
in great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from
what he has heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the
envelope himself; and thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you
prove that he did it? Did the prisoner take the envelope from under
the pillow, did he find the money, did that money exist indeed?
And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off, if you remember?
He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out where she was,
the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry out
a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act
of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a
jealous fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered
him he seized the money, too. But did he murder him after
all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man
cannot be accused of robbery, if it's impossible to state accurately
what he has stolen; that's an axiom. But did he murder him without
robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved? Isn't that,
too, a romance?</q>

<head>Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either</head>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a
man's life is at stake and that you must be careful. We have
heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to-day he hesitated to
<pb n='832'/><anchor id='Pg832'/>
accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the
crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was
produced in court to-day. <q>All was done as written.</q> But, I repeat
again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely to find out where
she was. That's a fact that can't be disputed. Had she been at
home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at
her side, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter.
He ran unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very
likely he did not even remember his drunken letter. <q>He snatched
up the pestle,</q> they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice
of psychology was built on that pestle&mdash;why he was bound to look
at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on. A
very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that
pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from
which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away
in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner's eye, and he
would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and
then he would certainly not have killed any one. How then can I
look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and
two days before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter,
he was quiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because
a Karamazov could not help quarreling, forsooth! But my
answer to that is, that, if he was planning such a murder in accordance
with his letter, he certainly would not have quarreled even with
a shopman, and probably would not have gone into the tavern at
all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement,
seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard, and that
not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,
the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can
use it. As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month,
don't we often hear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns
shout, <q>I'll kill you</q>? but they don't murder any one. And that
fatal letter&mdash;isn't that simply drunken irritability, too? Isn't that
simply the shout of the brawler outside the tavern, <q>I'll kill you!
I'll kill the lot of you!</q> Why not, why could it not be that? What
reason have we to call that letter <q>fatal</q> rather than absurd? Because
his father has been found murdered, because a witness saw the
<pb n='833'/><anchor id='Pg833'/>
prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his hand, and
was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything was
done as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not <q>absurd,</q>
but <q>fatal.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Now, thank God! we've come to the real point: <q>since he was
in the garden, he must have murdered him.</q> In those few words:
<q>since he <emph>was</emph>, then he <emph>must</emph></q> lies the whole case for the
prosecution. He was there, so he must have. And what if there is no <emph>must</emph>
about it, even if he was there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence&mdash;the
coincidences&mdash;are really suggestive. But examine all these facts
separately, regardless of their connection. Why, for instance, does
the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner's statement
that he ran away from his father's window? Remember the
sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the
respectful and <q>pious</q> sentiments which suddenly came over the murderer.
But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of
religious awe, if not of filial respect? <q>My mother must have been
praying for me at that moment,</q> were the prisoner's words at the
preliminary inquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced
himself that Madame Svyetlov was not in his father's house. <q>But
he could not convince himself by looking through the window,</q>
the prosecutor objects. But why couldn't he? Why? The window
opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some word might have
been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which showed
the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume everything
as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A
thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest
imagination.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly
was in the house, therefore he killed him.</q> Now about that
door, gentlemen of the jury.... Observe that we have only the
statement of one witness as to that door, and he was at the time
in such a condition, that&mdash; But supposing the door was open; supposing
the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an instinct of self-defense,
natural in his position; supposing he did go into the house&mdash;well,
what then? How does it follow that because he was there he
committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through the
rooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him;
<pb n='834'/><anchor id='Pg834'/>
but as soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he
may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had
not killed his father. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped
from the temptation to kill his father, because he had a clear conscience
and was rejoicing at not having killed him, that he was
capable of a pure feeling, the feeling of pity and compassion, and
leapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of Grigory after
he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the
dreadful state of the prisoner's mind at Mokroe when love again lay
before him calling him to new life, while love was impossible for
him because he had his father's bloodstained corpse behind him and
beyond that corpse&mdash;retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed
him love, which he explained, according to his method, talking
about his drunken condition, about a criminal being taken to execution,
about it being still far off, and so on and so on. But again I
ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not invented a new personality? Is
the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment
of love and of dodges to escape punishment, if his hands were
really stained with his father's blood? No, no, no! As soon as it
was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her
side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must have
felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed
himself, if he had his father's murder on his conscience. Oh, no!
he would not have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the
prisoner: the savage, stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor
is inconsistent with his character. He would have killed
himself, that's certain. He did not kill himself just because <q>his
mother's prayers had saved him,</q> and he was innocent of his father's
blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that night at Mokroe only
about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man would recover,
that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not have
to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?
What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But we shall be told at once again, <q>There is his father's corpse!
If he ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?</q>
Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who
murdered him, if not he? There's no one to put in his place.</q>
</p>

<pb n='835'/><anchor id='Pg835'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually
true that there is no one else at all? We've heard the prosecutor
count on his fingers all the persons who were in that house that
night. They were five in number; three of them, I agree, could not
have been responsible&mdash;the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and
his wife. There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the
prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov
because he had no one else to fix on, that had there been a
sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would have abandoned
the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have
accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not
draw the very opposite conclusion? There are two persons&mdash;the
prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my
client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And you
have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov
from all suspicion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It's true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his
two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who
accuse him: there are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion,
an obscure report, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence
of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit,
inconclusive. In the first place we have precisely on the day of the
catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor,
for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful defense. Then
Smerdyakov's sudden suicide on the eve of the trial. Then the
equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the elder of the
prisoner's brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has to-day
produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer.
Oh, I fully share the court's and the prosecutor's conviction
that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement
may really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save
his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man. But again
Smerdyakov's name is pronounced, again there is a suggestion of
mystery. There is something unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps
it may one day be explained. But we won't go into that now.
Of that later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime,
I might make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov
<pb n='836'/><anchor id='Pg836'/>
drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while
I admire his talent I cannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov,
I have seen him and talked to him, and he made a very different
impression on me. He was weak in health, it is true; but in
character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor
has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the timidity
on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity about
him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme mistrustfulness
concealed under a mask of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïveté</foreign>,
and an intelligence of
considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him
for weak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left
him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature,
excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made
some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and
would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of
<q>stinking Lizaveta.</q> He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory
and his wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed
and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming
a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn't the means
to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely
high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to
good clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself
to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence
of this), he might well have resented his position, compared
with that of his master's legitimate sons. They had everything, he
nothing. They had all the rights, they had the inheritance, while
he was only the cook. He told me himself that he had helped Fyodor
Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The destination of
that sum&mdash;a sum which would have made his career&mdash;must have
been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in
new rainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.)
Oh, beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of
money at once! And it was the first time he had seen so much
money in the hands of one man. The sight of the rainbow-colored
notes may have made a morbid impression on his imagination, but
with no immediate results.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched
for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov's
<pb n='837'/><anchor id='Pg837'/>
guilt, and asked us in particular what motive he had in
feigning a fit. But he may not have been feigning at all, the fit
may have happened quite naturally, but it may have passed off
quite naturally, and the sick man may have recovered, not completely
perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as happens with
epileptics.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have
committed the murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment.
He might have waked up from deep sleep (for he was only
asleep&mdash;an epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep) at that
moment when the old Grigory shouted at the top of his voice <q>Parricide!</q>
That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov
whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment: he
might naturally have waked up an hour before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no
definite motive towards the sound to see what's the matter. His
head is still clouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep;
but, once in the garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he
hears terrible news from his master, who would be, of course, glad
to see him. His mind sets to work at once. He hears all the details
from his frightened master, and gradually in his disordered brain
there shapes itself an idea&mdash;terrible, but seductive and irresistibly
logical. To kill the old man, take the three thousand, and throw
all the blame on to his young master. A terrible lust of money,
of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security from detection.
Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often
when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers
who have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And
Smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his plan. With what
weapon? Why, with any stone picked up in the garden. But what
for, with what object? Why, the three thousand which means a
career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting myself&mdash;the money
may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to
find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money&mdash;the
torn envelope on the floor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory
that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the
envelope on the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would
have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as
<pb n='838'/><anchor id='Pg838'/>
I listened that I was hearing something very familiar, and, would
you believe it, I have heard that very argument, that very conjecture,
of how Karamazov would have behaved, precisely two days
before, from Smerdyakov himself. What's more, it struck me at the
time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him;
that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy
it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate
the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented
prosecutor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I shall be asked, <q>What about the old woman, Grigory's wife?
She heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.</q> Yes, she heard
it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who
complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a
dog in the yard. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped
once or twice in the night. And that's natural. If any one is
asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but
instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a groan, he
wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two
hours later&mdash;three times altogether in the night. Next morning
the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning
all night and keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to
him: the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember, he
only remembers the moments of waking, so he feels he has been
waked up all night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess
in his last letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step
and not to both? But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and
the suicide may not have felt penitence, but only despair. Despair
and penitence are two very different things. Despair may be vindictive
and irreconcilable, and the suicide, laying his hands on himself,
may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had
envied all his life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice!
What is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find
the error in my reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And
if there is but a shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my
propositions, do not condemn him. And is there only a shade? I
swear by all that is sacred, I fully believe in the explanation of the
murder I have just put forward. What troubles me and makes me
<pb n='839'/><anchor id='Pg839'/>
indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution
against the prisoner, there is not a single one certain and
irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation
of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the
blood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt,
the dark night resounding with the shout <q>Parricide!</q> and the old
man falling with a broken head. And then the mass of phrases,
statements, gestures, shouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can
so bias the mind; but, gentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds?
Remember, you have been given absolute power to bind and to
loose, but the greater the power, the more terrible its responsibility.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now,
but suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my
luckless client had stained his hands with his father's blood. This
is only hypothesis, I repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his
innocence. But, so be it, I assume that my client is guilty of
parricide. Even so, hear what I have to say. I have it in my heart
to say something more to you, for I feel that there must be a great
conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive my referring to
your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to be
truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!</q>
</p>

<p>
At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause.
The last words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity
that every one felt that he really might have something to
say, and that what he was about to say would be of the greatest
consequence. But the President, hearing the applause, in a loud
voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were repeated.
Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch began in a voice full of
feeling quite unlike the tone he had used hitherto.

<head>Chapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought</head>

<p>
<q>It's not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client
with ruin, gentlemen of the jury,</q> he began, <q rend='pre'>what is really
damning for my client is one fact&mdash;the dead body of his father.
<pb n='840'/><anchor id='Pg840'/>
Had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the
charge in view of the triviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic
character of the evidence, if you examine each part of it
separately; or, at least, you would have hesitated to ruin a man's
life simply from the prejudice against him which he has, alas! only
too well deserved. But it's not an ordinary case of murder, it's a
case of parricide. That impresses men's minds, and to such a degree
that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes
less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind. How
can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he committed the murder
and gets off unpunished? That is what every one, almost involuntarily,
instinctively, feels at heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Yes, it's a fearful thing to shed a father's blood&mdash;the father who
has begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over
my illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness,
and has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a
father&mdash;that's inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a
father&mdash;a real father? What is the meaning of that great word?
What is the great idea in that name? We have just indicated in
part what a true father is and what he ought to be. In the case
in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts
are aching&mdash;in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov,
did not correspond to that conception of a father to which
we have just referred. That's the misfortune. And indeed some
fathers are a misfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather
more closely: we must shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury,
considering the importance of the decision you have to make. It's
our particular duty not to shrink from any idea, like children or
frightened women, as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent
(and he was my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several
times, <q>Oh, I will not yield the defense of the prisoner to the
lawyer who has come down from Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend
also!</q> He exclaimed that several times, but forgot to mention
that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three years so grateful
for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who had been
kind to him, as a child in his father's house, might not such a man
well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his
<pb n='841'/><anchor id='Pg841'/>
father's back-yard, <q>without boots on his feet and with his little
trousers hanging by one button</q>&mdash;to use the expression of the kind-hearted
doctor, Herzenstube?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at
this misfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did
my client meet with when he arrived here, at his father's house, and
why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled,
he is wild and unruly&mdash;we are trying him now for that&mdash;but
who is responsible for his life? Who is responsible for his
having received such an unseemly bringing up, in spite of his excellent
disposition and his grateful and sensitive heart? Did any one
train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by study? Did any
one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was left to
the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted perhaps
to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand
times perhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away
the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with
all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to forgive his
father! And what awaited him? He was met by cynical taunts,
suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard nothing but revolting
talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy, and
at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with his own
money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!
And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and
cruelty of his son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated
him, bought up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into
prison.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce,
unruly, and uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently
indeed, exceedingly tender-hearted, only they don't express
it. Don't laugh, don't laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor
laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving Schiller&mdash;loving
the sublime and beautiful! I should not have laughed at that
in his place. Yes, such natures&mdash;oh, let me speak in defense of such
natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood&mdash;these natures often
thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in contrast to
themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity&mdash;they thirst for it unconsciously.
Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully
<pb n='842'/><anchor id='Pg842'/>
capable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated
love. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in
such natures. But they cannot hide their passions&mdash;sometimes very
coarse&mdash;and that is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is
unseen. Their passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a
noble and lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks
a new life, seeks to correct himself, to be better, to become noble
and honorable, <q>sublime and beautiful,</q> however much the expression
has been ridiculed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client's
engagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard
just now was not evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and
revengeful woman, and it was not for her&mdash;oh, not for her!&mdash;to
reproach him with treachery, for she has betrayed him! If she had
had but a little time for reflection she would not have given such
evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client is not a monster,
as she called him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: <q>I
am the Good Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for
his sheep, so that not one of them might be lost.</q> Let not a man's
soul be lost through us!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I asked just now what does <q>father</q> mean, and exclaimed that it
was a great word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly,
gentlemen, and I venture to call things by their right names:
such a father as old Karamazov cannot be called a father and does
not deserve to be. Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity,
an impossibility. Love cannot be created from nothing: only God
can create something from nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,</q> the apostle writes,
from a heart glowing with love. It's not for the sake of my client
that I quote these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers.
Who has authorized me to preach to fathers? No one. But as a
man and a citizen I make my appeal&mdash;<foreign rend='italic'>vivos
voco!</foreign> We are not long
on earth, we do many evil deeds and say many evil words. So let us
all catch a favorable moment when we are all together to say a
good word to each other. That's what I am doing: while I am in
this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for nothing is
this tribune given us by the highest authority&mdash;all Russia hears us!
<pb n='843'/><anchor id='Pg843'/>
I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud
to all fathers: <q>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.</q> Yes,
let us first fulfill Christ's injunction ourselves and only then venture
to expect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but
enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies,
and we have made them our enemies ourselves. <q>What measure
ye mete it shall be measured unto you again</q>&mdash;it's not I who say that,
it's the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they measure
to you. How can we blame children if they measure us according
to our measure?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having
secretly given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of
which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft,
behind some bricks. It was opened and inside was found the body
of a new-born child which she had killed. In the same box were
found the skeletons of two other babies which, according to her own
confession, she had killed at the moment of their birth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She
gave birth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would
any one venture to give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be
bold, gentlemen, let us be audacious even: it's our duty to be so at
this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like
the Moscow women in Ostrovsky's play, who are scared at the sound
of certain words. No, let us prove that the progress of the last few
years has touched even us, and let us say plainly, the father is not
merely he who begets the child, but he who begets it and does his
duty by it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other interpretation
of the word <q>father,</q> which insists that any father, even
though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children,
still remains my father simply because he begot me. But this
is, so to say, the mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend
with my intellect, but can only accept by faith, or, better to say,
<emph>on faith</emph>, like many other things which I do not understand, but
which religion bids me believe. But in that case let it be kept outside
the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of actual life, which
has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us great duties and
obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be humane&mdash;Christian, in
<pb n='844'/><anchor id='Pg844'/>
fact&mdash;we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions justified by
reason and experience, which have been passed through the crucible
of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though in
dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not
ill-treat and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not
only mystic, but rational and philanthropic....</q>
</p>

<p>
There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of
the court, but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring
them to let him finish without interruption. The court relapsed
into silence at once. The orator went on.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up
and begin to reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot,
and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction. The
sight of an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting
questions to a young creature, especially when he compares him with
the excellent fathers of his companions. The conventional answer
to this question is: <q>He begot you, and you are his flesh and blood,
and therefore you are bound to love him.</q> The youth involuntarily
reflects: <q>But did he love me when he begot me?</q> he asks, wondering
more and more. <q>Was it for my sake he begot me? He did not
know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,
perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me
a propensity to drunkenness&mdash;that's all he's done for me.... Why
am I bound to love him simply for begetting me when he has cared
nothing for me all my life after?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but
do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. <q>Drive
nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window,</q> and, above
all, let us not be afraid of words, but decide the question according
to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas.
How shall it be decided? Why, like this. Let the son stand before
his father and ask him, <q>Father, tell me, why must I love you?
Father, show me that I must love you,</q> and if that father is able
to answer him and show him good reason, we have a real, normal,
parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on a rational,
responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he does
not, there's an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him,
and the son has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even
<pb n='845'/><anchor id='Pg845'/>
an enemy. Our tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a
school of true and sound ideas.</q>
</p>

<p>
(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost
frantic applause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a
good half of it applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded.
Shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery,
where the ladies were sitting. Handkerchiefs were waved. The
President began ringing his bell with all his might. He was obviously
irritated by the behavior of the audience, but did not venture
to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of high position,
old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially reserved
seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their handkerchiefs.
So that when the noise died down, the President confined
himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and Fetyukovitch,
excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which
so much has been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and
stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten
him. I insist most emphatically it was not for money he ran to
his father's house: the charge of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved
before. And it was not to murder him he broke into the house,
oh, no! If he had had that design he would, at least, have taken
the precaution of arming himself beforehand. The brass pestle he
caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it. Granted
that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that
he made his way in&mdash;I've said already that I do not for a moment
believe that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment.
Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that's holy, if it had not been his
father, but an ordinary enemy, he would, after running through the
rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there, have
made off, post-haste, without doing any harm to his rival. He would
have struck him, pushed him away perhaps, nothing more, for he
had no thought and no time to spare for that. What he wanted
to know was where she was. But his father, his father! The mere
sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood, had been
his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was enough!
A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly, clouding
his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse
<pb n='846'/><anchor id='Pg846'/>
of madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly
and unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging
the violation of its eternal laws.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But the prisoner even then did not murder him&mdash;I maintain
that, I cry that aloud!&mdash;no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst
of indignant disgust, not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he
would kill him. Had he not had this fatal pestle in his hand, he
would have only knocked his father down perhaps, but would not
have killed him. As he ran away, he did not know whether he had
killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder
is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be
called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide
by prejudice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul;
did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we
convict and punish him, he will say to himself: <q>These people
have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing
to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me
a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have
not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me
to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe
no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked.
They are cruel and I will be cruel.</q> That is what he will say, gentlemen
of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will
only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will
curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it. At the same
time you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man,
for he will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most
awful punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to
save him and regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your
mercy! You will see, you will hear how he will tremble and be
horror-struck. <q>How can I endure this mercy? How can I endure
so much love? Am I worthy of it?</q> That's what he will exclaim.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart,
gentlemen of the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts
for a great and loving action, it will melt and mount upwards.
There are souls which, in their limitation, blame the whole world.
<pb n='847'/><anchor id='Pg847'/>
But subdue such a soul with mercy, show it love, and it will curse
its past, for there are many good impulses in it. Such a heart will
expand and see that God is merciful and that men are good and
just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse and
the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say
then, <q>I am quits,</q> but will say, <q>I am guilty in the sight of all men
and am more unworthy than all.</q> With tears of penitence and
poignant, tender anguish, he will exclaim: <q>Others are better than
I, they wanted to save me, not to ruin me!</q> Oh, this act of mercy
is so easy for you, for in the absence of anything like real evidence
it will be too awful for you to pronounce: <q>Yes, he is guilty.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man!
Do you hear, do you hear that majestic voice from the past century
of our glorious history? It is not for an insignificant person like
me to remind you that the Russian court does not exist for the punishment
only, but also for the salvation of the criminal! Let other
nations think of retribution and the letter of the law, we will cling
to the spirit and the meaning&mdash;the salvation and the reformation
of the lost. If this is true, if Russia and her justice are such, she
may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to scare us with your
frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside in disgust.
Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia will move
calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of my
client, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice. You will defend
it, you will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch
over it, that it is in good hands!</q>

<p>
This was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm
of the audience burst like an irresistible storm. It was
out of the question to stop it: the women wept, many of the men
wept too, even two important personages shed tears. The President
submitted, and even postponed ringing his bell. The suppression of
such an enthusiasm would be the suppression of something sacred,
<pb n='848'/><anchor id='Pg848'/>
as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself was genuinely
touched.
</p>

<p>
And it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to
make certain objections. People looked at him with hatred. <q>What?
What's the meaning of it? He positively dares to make objections,</q>
the ladies babbled. But if the whole world of ladies, including
his wife, had protested he could not have been stopped at that
moment. He was pale, he was shaking with emotion, his first
phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath, could hardly
speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered himself. Of
this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But
what is this defense if not one romance on the top of another? All
that was lacking was poetry. Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for
his mistress, tears open the envelope and throws it on the floor. We
are even told what he said while engaged in this strange act. Is
not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we that he had
taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded
idiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society
for his illegitimate birth&mdash;isn't this a romance in the Byronic
style? And the son who breaks into his father's house and murders
him without murdering him is not even a romance&mdash;this is a sphinx
setting us a riddle which he cannot solve himself. If he murdered
him, he murdered him, and what's the meaning of his murdering
him without having murdered him&mdash;who can make head or tail of
this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true
and sound ideas and from this tribune of <q>sound ideas</q> is heard a
solemn declaration that to call the murder of a father <q>parricide</q> is
nothing but a prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every
child is to ask his father why he is to love him, what will become
of us? What will become of the foundations of society? What will
become of the family? Parricide, it appears, is only a bogy of Moscow
merchants' wives. The most precious, the most sacred guarantees
for the destiny and future of Russian justice are presented to us
in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an object&mdash;to obtain
the justification of something which cannot be justified. <q>Oh,
crush him by mercy,</q> cries the counsel for the defense; but that's all
<pb n='849'/><anchor id='Pg849'/>
the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is
crushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking
only for the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity
in the honor of the parricide to commemorate his exploit among
future generations? Religion and the Gospel are corrected&mdash;that's
all mysticism, we are told, and ours is the only true Christianity
which has been subjected to the analysis of reason and common
sense. And so they set up before us a false semblance of Christ!
<q>What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you again,</q> cried
the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that Christ teaches
us to measure as it is measured to us&mdash;and this from the tribune of
truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve
of making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance
with what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which
may be of use to produce a certain effect&mdash;all to serve the purpose!
But what Christ commands us is something very different: He bids
us beware of doing this, because the wicked world does this, but we
ought to forgive and to turn the other cheek, and not to measure
to our persecutors as they measure to us. This is what our God has
taught us and not that to forbid children to murder their fathers
is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of truth and good
sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for the
defense deigns to call only <q>the crucified lover of humanity,</q> in opposition
to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, <q>For Thou art
our God!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
At this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous
speaker, begging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds,
and so on, as presidents always do in such cases. The audience, too,
was uneasy. The public was restless: there were even exclamations
of indignation. Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only
mounted the tribune to lay his hand on his heart and, with an
offended voice, utter a few words full of dignity. He only touched
again, lightly and ironically, on <q>romancing</q> and <q>psychology,</q>
and in an appropriate place quoted, <q>Jupiter, you are angry, therefore
you are wrong,</q> which provoked a burst of approving laughter
in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like Jupiter.
Then, <foreign rend='italic'>à propos</foreign> of
the accusation that he was teaching the young
generation to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with
<pb n='850'/><anchor id='Pg850'/>
great dignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutor's
charge of uttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch
hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he had expected
in this court to be secure from accusations <q>damaging to
my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.</q> But at these words
the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch concluded his
speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court. And
Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, <q>crushed for
good.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said
very little. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally.
The look of strength and independence with which he had entered
in the morning had almost disappeared. He seemed as though he
had passed through an experience that day, which had taught him
for the rest of his life something very important he had not understood
till then. His voice was weak, he did not shout as before.
In his words there was a new note of humility, defeat and submission.
</p>

<p>
<q>What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment
has come for me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end
has come to an erring man! But, before God, I repeat to you, I am
innocent of my father's blood! For the last time I repeat, it wasn't
I killed him! I was erring, but I loved what is good. Every instant
I strove to reform, but I lived like a wild beast. I thank the
prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I did not
know; but it's not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is
mistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but
it's not true that I killed my father, and he needn't have supposed
it. And don't believe the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my
heart is heavy. If you spare me, if you let me go, I will pray for
you. I will be a better man. I give you my word before God I
will! And if you will condemn me, I'll break my sword over my
head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob me of my
God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen ...
spare me!</q>
</p>

<p>
He almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly
articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the
questions and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.
</p>

<pb n='851'/><anchor id='Pg851'/>

<p>
But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire
for consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last
charge to the jury was rather feeble. <q>Be impartial, don't be influenced
by the eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments.
Remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you,</q>
and so on and so on.
</p>

<p>
The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get
up, move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh
themselves at the buffet. It was very late, almost one o'clock in
the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no
one could think of repose. All waited with sinking hearts; though
that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a state
of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled. An
acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves
for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must own
there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an
acquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while
some were simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch
himself was confident of his success. He was surrounded
by people congratulating him and fawning upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are,</q> he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, <q>there
are invisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the
jury. One feels during one's speech if they are being formed. I
was aware of them. They exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind
at rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What will our peasants say now?</q> said one stout, cross-looking,
pock-marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching
a group of gentlemen engaged in conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks
among them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, there are clerks,</q> said a member of the district council,
joining the group.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal,
a juryman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a man with brains.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But he never speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is no great talker, but so much the better. There's no need
<pb n='852'/><anchor id='Pg852'/>
for the Petersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg
himself. He's the father of twelve children. Think of that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word, you don't suppose they won't acquit him?</q>
one of our young officials exclaimed in another group.
</p>

<p>
<q>They'll acquit him for certain,</q> said a resolute voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!</q> cried the
official. <q>Suppose he did murder him&mdash;there are fathers and fathers!
And, besides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have
done nothing but swing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old
man down. But it was a pity they dragged the valet in. That was
simply an absurd theory! If I'd been in Fetyukovitch's place, I
should simply have said straight out: <q>He murdered him; but he is
not guilty, hang it all!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what he did, only without saying, <q>Hang it all!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,</q> put in a
third voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town
who had cut the throat of her lover's lawful wife.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That makes no difference. She began cutting it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid,
wasn't it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Splendid!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And about mysticism, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, drop mysticism, do!</q> cried some one else; <q>think of Ippolit
and his fate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes
out to-morrow for Mitya's sake.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is she here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What an idea! If she'd been here she'd have scratched them out
in court. She is at home with toothache. He he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He he he!</q>
</p>

<p>
In a third group:
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should not be surprised if he turns the <q>Metropolis</q> upside down
to-morrow. He will be drinking for ten days!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, the devil!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil's bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if
not here?</q>
</p>

<pb n='853'/><anchor id='Pg853'/>

<p>
<q>Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it's not the
thing to break your father's head with a pestle! Or what are we
coming to?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his
purpose.</q>
</p>
