<p>
<q>I used to wash him in his tub. He's insulted me,</q> repeated
Grigory.
</p>

<p>
<q>Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him away perhaps he'd have
murdered him. It wouldn't take much to do for Æsop, would it?</q>
whispered Ivan to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>God forbid!</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should He forbid?</q> Ivan went on in the same whisper, with
a malignant grimace. <q>One reptile will devour the other. And
serve them both right, too.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha shuddered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I won't let him be murdered as I didn't just now.
Stay here, Alyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard. My head's begun
to ache.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went to his father's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind
the screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened
his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering
and meditating. All at once his face betrayed extraordinary
excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha,</q> he whispered apprehensively, <q>where's Ivan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood
on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his
nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead
there was a rather large crimson bruise.
</p>

<p>
<q>What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm
afraid of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're
the only one I'm not afraid of....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My
angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She won't marry him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!</q>
</p>

<p>
The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more
comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>
Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively
glittered in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just
now,</q> he said. <q>Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll
let you go back to the monastery.... I was joking this morning,
don't be angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha,
comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me the truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You're still asking whether she has been here or not?</q> Alyosha
said sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to
Grushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her;
see for yourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh?
What? Can you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If I see her I'll ask her,</q> Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, she won't tell you,</q> the old man interrupted, <q>she's a rogue.
She'll begin kissing you and say that it's you she wants. She's a deceitful,
shameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you mustn't!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, father, and it wouldn't be suitable, it wouldn't be right
at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where was he sending you just now? He shouted <q>Go</q> as he
ran away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Katerina Ivanovna.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For money? To ask her for money?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No. Not for money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He's no money; not a farthing. I'll settle down for the night,
and think things over, and you can go. Perhaps you'll meet her....
Only be sure to come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be
sure to. I have a word to say to you to-morrow. Will you come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When you come, pretend you've come of your own accord to ask
after me. Don't tell any one I told you to. Don't say a word to
Ivan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall
never forget it. I've a word to say to you to-morrow&mdash;but I must
think about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And how do you feel now?</q>
</p>

<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>

<p>
<q>I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly
well!</q>
</p>

<p>
Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at
the gateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his
note-book. Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was
conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,</q>
said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete
surprise to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow,</q> answered Alyosha, <q>I
may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you're going to her now, anyway? For that <q>compliments
and farewell,</q></q> said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part
of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say
that he&mdash;well, in fact&mdash;takes his leave of her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, how will all this horror end between father and
Dmitri?</q> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle
out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old
man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look
at other men and decide which is worthy to live?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often
decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And
as for rights&mdash;who has not the right to wish?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not for another man's death?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since
all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring
to what I said just now&mdash;that one reptile will devour the other?
In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable
of shedding Æsop's blood, murdering him, eh?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my
mind. I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks, if only for that,</q> smiled Ivan. <q>Be sure, I should always
defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in
this case. Good-by till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't
look on me as a villain,</q> he added with a smile.
</p>

<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>

<p>
They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha
felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and
that he had certainly done this with some definite motive.

<p>
Alyosha left his father's house feeling even more exhausted
and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind
too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid
to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea
from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He
felt something bordering upon despair, which he had never known
till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the
fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his father
and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had
himself been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them
face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy,
terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It
appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so
than Alyosha could have supposed before. There was something
positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him,
which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he felt
for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women?
Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna's
in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind.
On the contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find
guidance from her. Yet to give her this message was obviously
more difficult than before. The matter of the three thousand was
decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and
losing his last hope, might sink to any depth. He had, moreover,
told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just
taken place with his father.
</p>

<p>
It was by now seven o'clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha
entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street
occupied by Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
two aunts. One of them, a woman of little education, was that
aunt of her half-sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her
in her father's house when she came from boarding-school. The
other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence, though in
straitened circumstances. It was said that they both gave way
in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept them
with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no
one but her benefactress, the general's widow, who had been kept
by illness in Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice
a week a full account of all her doings.
</p>

<p>
When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened
the door to him to take his name up, it was evident that they were
already aware of his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the
window. At least, Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying
footsteps and rustling skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had
run out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such
excitement. He was conducted however to the drawing-room at
once. It was a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at all
in provincial style. There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and
little tables. There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on
the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window.
It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made out a silk mantle
thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just been
sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups
of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another
with sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and
frowned. But at that instant the portière was raised, and with
rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out
both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight. At the
same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them
on the table.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God! At last you have come too! I've been simply
praying for you all day! Sit down.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when,
three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina
Ivanovna's special request, to be introduced to her. There had been
no conversation between them at that interview, however. Supposing
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the
time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha had been silent, but he had
seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck by the imperiousness,
proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl. And all that
was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He
thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with
her pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in
the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his
brother might well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could
not be loved for long. He expressed this thought almost plainly
to Dmitri when, after the visit, his brother besought and insisted
that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll be happy with her, but perhaps&mdash;not tranquilly happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They
don't yield to fate. So you think I shan't love her for ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won't
always be happy with her.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry
with himself for having yielded to his brother's entreaties and put
such <q>foolish</q> ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as
awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed
too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman. It
was with the more amazement that he felt now, at the first glance
at Katerina Ivanovna as she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been
utterly mistaken. This time her face was beaming with spontaneous
good-natured kindliness, and direct warm-hearted sincerity. The
<q>pride and haughtiness,</q> which had struck Alyosha so much before,
was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy and a sort of
bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the first glance,
at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in relation to
the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she perhaps
already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite
of that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the
future. Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in
his thoughts. He was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides
all this, he noticed at her first words that she was in great
excitement, an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost
approaching ecstasy.
</p>

<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>

<p>
<q>I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole
truth&mdash;from you and no one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have come,</q> muttered Alyosha confusedly, <q>I&mdash;he sent me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything&mdash;everything!</q>
cried Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. <q>Wait a
moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I'll tell you why I've been so longing
to see you. You see, I know perhaps far more than you do yourself,
and there's no need for you to tell me anything. I'll tell you what I
want from you. I want to know your own last impression of him.
I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely even (oh, as
coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and of
his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps
be better than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does
not want to come to me. Do you understand what I want from
you? Now, tell me simply, tell me every word of the message he
sent you with (I knew he would send you).</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He told me to give you his compliments&mdash;and to say that he
would never come again&mdash;but to give you his compliments.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His compliments? Was that what he said&mdash;his own expression?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps
he did not use the right word?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me
two or three times not to forget to say so.</q>
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your
help. I'll tell you what I think, and you must simply say whether
it's right or not. Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in
passing, without insisting on your repeating the words, without
emphasizing them, that would be the end of everything! But if he
particularly insisted on those words, if he particularly told you not
to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he was in excitement,
beside himself. He had made his decision and was frightened at it.
He wasn't walking away from me with a resolute step, but leaping
headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply
bravado.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes!</q> cried Alyosha warmly. <q>I believe that is it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And, if so, he's not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay!
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
Did he not tell you anything about money&mdash;about three thousand
roubles?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He did speak about it, and it's that more than anything that's
crushing him. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing
matters now,</q> Alyosha answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope
in his heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape
and salvation for his brother. <q>But do you know about the money?</q>
he added, and suddenly broke off.
</p>

<p>
<q>I've known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire,
and heard long ago that the money had not arrived. He
hadn't sent the money, but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that
he was still in need of money. My only object in all this was that
he should know to whom to turn, and who was his true friend.
No, he won't recognize that I am his truest friend; he won't know
me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I've been tormented all
the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed
to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel
ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people's knowing,
but not of my knowing. He can tell God everything without
shame. Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready
to bear for his sake? Why, why doesn't he know me? How dare
he not know me after all that has happened? I want to save him
for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed. And here he fears
that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn't afraid to be open
with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don't deserve the
same?</q>
</p>

<p>
The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must tell you,</q> Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, <q>what
happened just now between him and my father.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to
get the money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and
after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take
his compliments and farewell. <q>He went to that woman,</q> Alyosha
added softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you suppose that I can't put up with that woman?
Does he think I can't? But he won't marry her,</q> she suddenly
laughed nervously. <q>Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov?
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
It's passion, not love. He won't marry her because she
won't marry him.</q> Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely.
</p>

<p>
<q>He may marry her,</q> said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
</p>

<p>
<q>He won't marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you
know that? Do you know that?</q> Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed
suddenly with extraordinary warmth. <q>She is one of the most fantastic
of fantastic creatures. I know how bewitching she is, but I
know too that she is kind, firm and noble. Why do you look at
me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are wondering at
my words, perhaps you don't believe me? Agrafena Alexandrovna,
my angel!</q> she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the next
room, <q>come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He
knows all about our affairs. Show yourself to him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,</q>
said a soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.
</p>

<p>
The portière was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming,
came up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha.
He fixed his eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she
was, that awful woman, the <q>beast,</q> as Ivan had called her half an
hour before. And yet one would have thought the creature standing
before him most simple and ordinary, a good-natured, kind woman,
handsome certainly, but so like other handsome ordinary women!
It is true she was very, very good-looking with that Russian beauty
so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall woman,
though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was exceptionally
tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were, noiseless, movements,
softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her voice. She
moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step, but
noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She
sank softly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk
dress, and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders
in a costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old,
and her face looked exactly that age. She was very white in the
face, with a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The modeling of her
face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle
forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower
lip was at least twice as full, and looked pouting. But her magnificent,
abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have
made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd
in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long
after. What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of
childlike good nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look
of childish delight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight
and seeming to expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding
curiosity. The light in her eyes gladdened the soul&mdash;Alyosha
felt that. There was something else in her which he could not
understand, or would not have been able to define, and which yet
perhaps unconsciously affected him. It was that softness, that
voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that catlike noiselessness.
Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl could be seen
full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her figure
suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in somewhat
exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs
of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this
fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of
thirty, would <q>spread</q>; that the face would become puffy, and that
wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the
eyes; the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps&mdash;in fact,
that it was the beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so
often met with in Russian women. Alyosha, of course, did not
think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he wondered with
an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she drawled
in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently
feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation
of the syllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that
showed bad education and a false idea of good manners. And yet
this intonation and manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost
incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression
of her face, the soft, babyish joy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna
at once made her sit down in an arm-chair facing Alyosha, and
ecstatically kissed her several times on her smiling lips. She seemed
quite in love with her.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the first time we've met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she said
rapturously. <q>I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to
her, but I'd no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>
knew we should settle everything together&mdash;everything. My heart
told me so&mdash;I was begged not to take the step, but I foresaw it
would be a way out of the difficulty, and I was not mistaken.
Grushenka has explained everything to me, told me all she means
to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness and brought us peace
and joy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,</q> drawled
Grushenka in her sing-song voice, still with the same charming
smile of delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch!
Disdain you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks
as though it were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and
more. Look how she laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one's
heart good to see the angel.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running
down him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am
not at all worthy of your kindness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not worthy! She's not worthy of it!</q> Katerina Ivanovna cried
again with the same warmth. <q>You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
we're fanciful, we're self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our
little heart. We're noble, we're generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let
me tell you. We have only been unfortunate. We were too ready
to make every sacrifice for an unworthy, perhaps, or fickle man.
There was one man&mdash;one, an officer too, we loved him, we sacrificed
everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago, and he has
forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has written,
he is coming here, and, do you know, we've loved him, none but
him, all this time, and we've loved him all our life! He will come,
and Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she's
been wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her
favor? Only that bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her
father, her friend, her protector. He found her then in despair, in
agony, deserted by the man she loved. She was ready to drown herself
then, but the old merchant saved her&mdash;saved her!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a
great hurry about everything,</q> Grushenka drawled again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
defend you? Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that
charming soft little hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It
has brought me happiness and has lifted me up, and I'm going to
kiss it, outside and inside, here, here, here!</q>
</p>

<p>
And three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather
fat, hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand
with a charming musical, nervous little laugh, watched the <q>sweet
young lady,</q> and obviously liked having her hand kissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps there's rather too much rapture,</q> thought Alyosha. He
blushed. He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand
like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think I meant to make you blush?</q> said Katerina Ivanovna,
somewhat surprised. <q>Ah, my dear, how little you understand
me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young
lady. Maybe I'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart;
I will have my own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch
that day simply for fun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But now you'll save him. You've given me your word. You'll
explain it all to him. You'll break to him that you have long loved
another man, who is now offering you his hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no! I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you
kept talking about that. I didn't give you my word.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then I didn't quite understand you,</q> said Katerina Ivanovna
slowly, turning a little pale. <q>You promised&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, angel lady, I've promised nothing,</q> Grushenka interrupted
softly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression.
<q>You see at once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I
am compared with you. If I want to do a thing I do it. I may
have made you some promise just now. But now again I'm thinking:
I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much once&mdash;liked
him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him
to stay with me from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just now you said&mdash;something quite different,</q> Katerina Ivanovna
whispered faintly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, just now! But, you know. I'm such a soft-hearted, silly
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
creature. Only think what he's gone through on my account!
What if when I go home I feel sorry for him? What then?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never expected&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with
me! Now perhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now
you know my character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic
lady,</q> she said tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina
Ivanovna's hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you
did mine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours
three hundred times to be even with you. Well, but let that pass.
And then it shall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave
entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave. Let it be as God
wills, without any agreements and promises. What a sweet hand&mdash;what
a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you incredible
beauty!</q>
</p>

<p>
She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object
indeed of <q>being even</q> with her in kisses.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with
timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her
bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently
into her eyes; she still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted,
confiding expression, the same bright gayety.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's perhaps too naïve,</q> thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a
gleam of hope.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the <q>sweet hand.</q>
She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three
minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, angel lady,</q> she suddenly drawled in an even
more soft and sugary voice, <q>do you know, after all, I think I won't
kiss your hand?</q> And she laughed a little merry laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>As you please. What's the matter with you?</q> said Katerina
Ivanovna, starting suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand,
but I didn't kiss yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness
at Katerina Ivanovna.
</p>

<p>
<q>Insolent creature!</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from
her seat.
</p>

<p>
Grushenka too got up, but without haste.
</p>

<p>
<q>So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss
yours at all. And how he will laugh!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Vile slut! Go away!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming
for you, dear young lady, a word like that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away! You're a creature for sale!</q> screamed Katerina
Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face.
</p>

<p>
<q>For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for
money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.</q>
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but
Alyosha held her with all his strength.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll
go away&mdash;she'll go at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry,
and with them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go away,</q> said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the
sofa. <q>Alyosha, darling, see me home!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away&mdash;go away, make haste!</q> cried Alyosha, clasping his
hands imploringly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little story
to tell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha.
See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out
of the house, laughing musically.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and
was shaken with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I warned you,</q> said the elder of her aunts. <q>I tried to prevent
your doing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a
thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she's worse
than any of them. You are too self-willed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She's a tigress!</q> yelled Katerina Ivanovna. <q>Why did you hold
me, Alexey Fyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her&mdash;beaten her!</q>
</p>

<p>
She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did
not care to, indeed.
</p>

<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>

<p>
<q>She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha withdrew towards the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, my God!</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands.
<q>He! He! He could be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he
told that creature what happened on that fatal, accursed day! <q>You
brought your beauty for sale, dear young lady.</q> She knows it!
Your brother's a scoundrel, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn't find a word.
His heart ached.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful, it's awful for
me! To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don't
condemn me. Forgive me. I don't know what I shall do with myself
now!</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept
as she did. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
</p>

<p>
<q>The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame
Hohlakov; it's been left with us since dinner-time.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it,
almost unconsciously, into his pocket.
</p>

<head>Chapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined</head>

<p>
It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the
town to the monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road,
at that hour deserted. It was almost night, and too dark to see
anything clearly at thirty paces ahead. There were cross-roads
half-way. A figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the
cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-roads the figure
moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:
</p>

<p>
<q>Your money or your life!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So it's you, Mitya,</q> cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled
however.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha ha ha! You didn't expect me? I wondered where to wait
for you. By her house? There are three ways from it, and I might
have missed you. At last I thought of waiting here, for you had to
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
pass here, there's no other way to the monastery. Come, tell me
the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But what's the matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing, brother&mdash;it's the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri!
Father's blood just now.</q> (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on
the verge of tears for a long time, and now something seemed to
snap in his soul.) <q>You almost killed him&mdash;cursed him&mdash;and
now&mdash;here&mdash;you're
making jokes&mdash;<q>Your money or your life!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what of that? It's not seemly&mdash;is that it? Not suitable in
my position?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No&mdash;I only&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what
clouds, what a wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting
for you. And as God's above, I suddenly thought, why go on in
misery any longer, what is there to wait for? Here I have a willow,
a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist them into a rope in a minute,
and braces besides, and why go on burdening the earth, dishonoring
it with my vile presence? And then I heard you coming&mdash;Heavens,
it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So there is
a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little
brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only
one I love in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that
moment that I thought, <q>I'll fall on his neck at once.</q> Then a stupid
idea struck me, to have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted,
like a fool, <q>Your money!</q> Forgive my foolery&mdash;it was only nonsense,
and there's nothing unseemly in my soul.... Damn it all,
tell me what's happened. What did she say? Strike me, crush me,
don't spare me! Was she furious?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There&mdash;I
found them both there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Both? Whom?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna's.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dmitri was struck dumb.
</p>

<p>
<q>Impossible!</q> he cried. <q>You're raving! Grushenka with her?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he
went in to Katerina Ivanovna's. He was ten minutes telling his
story. He can't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively,
but he seemed to make it clear, not omitting any word or action
of significance, and vividly describing, often in one word, his own
<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>
sensations. Dmitri listened in silence, gazing at him with a terrible
fixed stare, but it was clear to Alyosha that he understood it all,
and had grasped every point. But as the story went on, his face
became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He scowled, he clenched
his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more rigid, more concentrated,
more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible rapidity, his
wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips parted,
and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous
laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he
could not speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>So she wouldn't kiss her hand! So she didn't kiss it; so she ran
away!</q> he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight
it might have been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. <q>So
the other one called her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought
to be flogged on a scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That's just
what I think; she ought to have been long ago. It's like this,
brother, let her be punished, but I must get better first. I understand
the queen of impudence. That's her all over! You saw her
all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She's magnificent in
her own line! So she ran home? I'll go&mdash;ah&mdash;I'll run to her!
Alyosha, don't blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But Katerina Ivanovna!</q> exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>I see her, too! I see right through her, as I've never done before!
It's a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is,
of the five! What a thing to do! That's just like Katya, who was
not afraid to face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly
insult on a generous impulse to save her father! But the pride, the
recklessness, the defiance of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say
that aunt tried to stop her? That aunt, you know, is overbearing,
herself. She's the sister of the general's widow in Moscow, and even
more stuck-up than she. But her husband was caught stealing
government money. He lost everything, his estate and all, and the
proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn't raised them since. So
she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn't listen to her! She
thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will give way
to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and
she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault
is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka's hand first, on purpose,
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by Grushenka, that's
to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her own delusion&mdash;because
it was <emph>her</emph> dream, <emph>her</emph> delusion! Alyosha, darling, how
did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up your
cassock and run? Ha ha ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted
Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she
flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in
secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that
insult?</q>
</p>

<p>
What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as
it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's
humiliation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bah!</q> Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with
his hand. He only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told
him of the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: <q>Your brother is
a scoundrel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that <q>fatal day,</q>
as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time
at Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was
sobbing. I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's
image, and Grushenka understood it. She understood it all then. I
remember, she cried herself.... Damn it all! But it's bound to
be so now.... Then she cried, but now <q>the dagger in the heart</q>!
That's how women are.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked down and sank into thought.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!</q> he said suddenly,
in a gloomy voice. <q>It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm
a scoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort.
Come, that's enough. Good-by. It's no use talking! It's not
amusing. You go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see
you again except as a last resource. Good-by, Alexey!</q>
</p>

<p>
He warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down, without
raising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly
towards the town.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away
so abruptly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!</q> cried Dmitri,
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
suddenly turning back. <q>Look at me. Look at me well. You see
here, here&mdash;there's terrible disgrace in store for me.</q> (As he said
<q>here,</q> Dmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air, as
though the dishonor lay precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a
pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his neck.) <q>You know me now,
a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've never
done anything before and never shall again, anything that can compare
in baseness with the dishonor which I bear now at this very
minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass, though
I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it through, note
that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I shan't stop
it. I told you everything just now, but I didn't tell you this, because
even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if I do,
I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I
shan't pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear
witness that I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction!
No need to explain. You'll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley
and the she-devil. Good-by. Don't pray for me, I'm not
worth it. And there's no need, no need at all.... I don't need it!
Away!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards
the monastery.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?</q> he
wondered wildly. <q>Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I
shall look him up. I shall make a point of it. What does he mean?</q>
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the
hermitage. The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted
at that hour. There was a tremor in his heart as he went into
Father Zossima's cell.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the
world? Here was peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion,
there was darkness in which one lost one's way and went
astray at once....</q>
</p>

<p>
In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Païssy, who
came every hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt
with alarm that he was getting worse and worse. Even his usual
discourse with the brothers could not take place that day. As a
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>
rule every evening after service the monks flocked into Father
Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their sins of the day, their
sinful thoughts and temptations; even their disputes, if there had
been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder absolved, reconciled,
exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them. It was
against this general <q>confession</q> that the opponents of <q>elders</q> protested,
maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament of
confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different thing.
They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such confessions
attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led
to sin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the
elder, and went against their own will because every one went, and
for fear they should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People
said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, <q>I'll confess
I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,</q>
simply in order to have something to say. Alyosha knew that this
actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among
the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from
relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read
by him before those to whom they were addressed.
</p>

<p>
It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in
good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance.
But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much
that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more
experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that
<q>for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation,
such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of
great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and
repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering
the monastery&mdash;their proper place is in the world. Even in the
temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no
good taking it too much into account.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,</q> Father Païssy
whispered to Alyosha, as he blessed him. <q>It's difficult to rouse
him. And he must not be roused. He waked up for five minutes,
sent his blessing to the brothers, and begged their prayers for him
at night. He intends to take the sacrament again in the morning.
He remembered you, Alexey. He asked whether you had gone
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
away, and was told that you were in the town. <q>I blessed him for
that work,</q> he said, <q>his place is there, not here, for awhile.</q> Those
were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with
anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it
that he has decided that you shall spend some time in the world?
He must have foreseen something in your destiny! Understand,
Alexey, that if you return to the world, it must be to do the duty
laid upon you by your elder, and not for frivolous vanity and
worldly pleasures.</q>
</p>

<p>
Father Païssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father
Zossima was dying, though he might live another day or two.
Alyosha firmly and ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to
his father, the Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not
leave the monastery next day, but would remain with his elder to
the end. His heart glowed with love, and he reproached himself
bitterly for having been able for one instant to forget him whom
he had left in the monastery on his deathbed, and whom he honored
above every one in the world. He went into Father Zossima's bedroom,
knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder, who
slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing
and a peaceful face.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had
received his guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay
down on the hard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used
as a bed, bringing nothing but a pillow. The mattress, about which
his father had shouted to him that morning, he had long forgotten
to lie on. He took off his cassock, which he used as a covering. But
before going to bed, he fell on his knees and prayed a long time.
In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to lighten his darkness
but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which always visited his
soul after the praise and adoration, of which his evening prayer
usually consisted. That joy always brought him light untroubled
sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the little
pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina Ivanovna's.

<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she wrote, <q rend='pre'>I am writing to you without
any one's knowledge, even mamma's, and I know how wrong it is.
But I cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung
up in my heart, and this no one but us two must know for a time.

say, does not blush, but I assure you it's not true and that it's
blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha, I love you, I've
loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when you
were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you
