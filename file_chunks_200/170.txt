<p>
<q>Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his
mother!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is dying to-day,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or
some one, about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am
I can't see him! The whole town is in excitement, they are all
suspense. But now&mdash;do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, that's lucky,</q> cried Alyosha. <q>Then I shall see her here.
She told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know, I know all. I've heard exactly what happened yesterday&mdash;and
the atrocious behavior of that&mdash;creature.
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>C'est tragique</foreign>,
and if I'd been in her place I don't know what I should have done.
And your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?&mdash;my
goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am forgetting, only fancy;
your brother is in there with her, not that dreadful brother who
was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he is
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
sitting with her talking; they are having a serious conversation. If
you could only imagine what's passing between them now&mdash;it's
awful, I tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale of
horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.
They both recognize it and revel in it. I've been watching for you!
I've been thirsting for you! It's too much for me, that's the worst
of it. I'll tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of
something else, the most important thing&mdash;I had quite forgotten
what's most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in hysterics?
As soon as she heard you were here, she began to be hysterical!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Maman</foreign>, it's you who are
hysterical now, not I,</q> Lise's voice
caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice
sounded as though she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost
to control it. Alyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise
was peeping through it, but that he could not see.
</p>

<p>
<q>And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make
me hysterical too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has
been so ill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for
the morning and for Herzenstube to come. He says that he can
make nothing of it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes
and says that he can make nothing of it. As soon as you approached
the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and insisted on being
wheeled back into this room here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, I didn't know he had come. It wasn't on his account
I wanted to be wheeled into this room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch
was coming. She was on the look-out for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My darling mamma, it's not at all clever of you. But if you
want to make up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma,
you'd better tell our honored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he
has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened
yesterday and although every one is laughing at him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who
laughs at him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can't do
without him. Oh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what's the matter with you, mamma, darling?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>
night of fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting,
everlasting, that's the worst of it! Everything, in fact, everything....
Even that miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how
it has shattered me, that miracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And
that tragedy in the drawing-room, it's more than I can bear, I warn
you. I can't bear it. A comedy, perhaps, not a tragedy. Tell me,
will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he? Oh, my God!
What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes and see
that it's all nonsense, all nonsense.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should be very grateful,</q> Alyosha interrupted suddenly, <q>if
you could give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have
hurt it, and it's very painful.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked
with blood. Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!</q>
</p>

<p>
But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha's finger through the crack, she
flung the door wide open.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, come here,</q> she cried, imperiously. <q>No nonsense now!
Good heavens, why did you stand there saying nothing about it all
this time? He might have bled to death, mamma! How did you
do it? Water, water! You must wash it first of all, simply hold it
in cold water to stop the pain, and keep it there, keep it there....
Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin. But do make
haste,</q> she finished nervously. She was quite frightened at the sight
of Alyosha's wound.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shouldn't we send for Herzenstube?</q> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, you'll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will
come and say that he can make nothing of it! Water, water!
Mamma, for goodness' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such
a slowcoach and never can come quickly! Make haste, mamma, or
I shall die.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's nothing much,</q> cried Alyosha, frightened at this
alarm.
</p>

<p>
Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some lint, mamma, for mercy's sake, bring some lint and that
muddy caustic lotion for wounds, what's it called? We've got
some. You know where the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
in the right-hand cupboard, there's a big bottle of it there with the
lint.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don't scream and
don't fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it.
Where did you get such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting
for.
</p>

<p>
<q>First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like
this?</q> she asked Alyosha, quickly. <q>And then I'll talk to you about
something quite different. Well?</q>
</p>

<p>
Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother's absence was
precious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic
meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise
clasped her hands at his story.
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?</q>
she cried angrily, as though she had a right to control him. <q>You
are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy!
But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me
all about it, for there's some mystery in it. Now for the second
thing, but first a question: does the pain prevent you talking about
utterly unimportant things, but talking sensibly?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course not, and I don't feel much pain now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's because your finger is in the water. It must be changed
directly, for it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice
from the cellar and another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can
speak; will you give me the letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey
Fyodorovitch&mdash;be quick, for mamma will be back in a minute and
I don't want&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't got the letter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You've
got it in that pocket. I've been regretting that joke all night.
Give me back the letter at once, give it me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've left it at home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you can't consider me as a child, a little girl, after that silly
joke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me
the letter, if you really haven't got it&mdash;bring it to-day, you must,
you must.</q>
</p>

<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>

<p>
<q>To-day I can't possibly, for I am going back to the monastery
and I shan't come and see you for the next two days&mdash;three or four
perhaps&mdash;for Father Zossima&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very
much?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I didn't laugh at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because I believed all you said.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are insulting me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would
come to pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the
monastery. Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when
you reach the legal age we will be married. I shall love you. Though
I haven't had time to think about it, I believe I couldn't find a
better wife than you, and Father Zossima tells me I must marry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,</q> laughed Lise,
flushing crimson.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll wheel you about myself, but I'm sure you'll get well by
then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are mad,</q> said Lise, nervously, <q>to make all this nonsense
out of a joke! Here's mamma, very <foreign rend='italic'>à propos</foreign>, perhaps.
Mamma, how slow you always are, how can you be so long! And
here's Yulia with the ice!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, Lise, don't scream, above all things don't scream. That
scream drives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in
another place? I've been hunting and hunting&mdash;I do believe you
did it on purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I couldn't tell that he would come with a bad finger, or
else perhaps I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma,
you begin to say really witty things.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling
for Alexey Fyodorovitch's sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey
Fyodorovitch, what's killing me is no one thing in particular, not
Herzenstube, but everything together, that's what is too much
for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,</q> Lise
laughed gayly. <q>Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma.
That's simply Goulard's water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>
the name now, but it's a splendid lotion. Would you believe it,
mamma, on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street,
and it was a boy bit his finger, isn't he a child, a child himself? Is
he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he wants to be
married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn't it be funny,
wouldn't it be awful?</q>
</p>

<p>
And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly
at Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing?
It's quite out of place&mdash;and perhaps the boy was rabid.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your
boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad
and bite any one near him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey
Fyodorovitch! I couldn't have done it. Do you still feel the pain?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It's nothing much now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't feel afraid of water?</q> asked Lise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, that's enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick
talking of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once
Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here, Alexey
Fyodorovitch, she simply rushed at me, she's dying to see you,
dying!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can't go just now, he is
in too much pain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all, I can go quite well,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>What! You are going away? Is that what you say?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, when I've seen them, I'll come back here and we can talk
as much as you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at
once, for I am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as
I can.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don't
trouble to come and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your
monastery and a good riddance. I want to sleep, I didn't sleep all
night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would
sleep!</q> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know what I've done.... I'll stay another three minutes,
five if you like,</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>

<p>
<q>Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a
monster.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too
capricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one
has with nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep
after seeing you. How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how
fortunate it is!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it,
mamma.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> Madame
Hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid
whisper. <q>I don't want to suggest anything, I don't want to lift
the veil, you will see for yourself what's going on. It's appalling.
It's the most fantastic farce. She loves your brother, Ivan, and she
is doing her utmost to persuade herself she loves your brother,
Dmitri. It's appalling! I'll go in with you, and if they don't turn
me out, I'll stay to the end.</q>

<head>Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room</head>

<p>
But in the drawing-room the conversation was already over.
Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute.
At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan
Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale,
and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve
a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha.
During the preceding month it had been several times suggested
to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina
Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant <q>to carry her off</q>
from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous,
though it worried him extremely. He loved both his
brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri
had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan
was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In
what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha
had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna
had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed
it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was
incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri,
and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such
a passion.
</p>

<p>
But during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had
struck him. The word <q>lacerating,</q> which Madame Hohlakov had
just uttered, almost made him start, because half waking up towards
daybreak that night he had cried out <q>Laceration, laceration,</q>
probably applying it to his dream. He had been dreaming all night
of the previous day's scene at Katerina Ivanovna's. Now Alyosha
was impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and persistent assertion
that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and only deceived
herself through some sort of pose, from <q>self-laceration,</q> and tortured
herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied
duty of gratitude. <q>Yes,</q> he thought, <q>perhaps the whole truth
lies in those words.</q> But in that case what was Ivan's position?
Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna's
must dominate, and she could only dominate some one like Dmitri,
and never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri might at last submit to her
domination <q>to his own happiness</q> (which was what Alyosha would
have desired), but Ivan&mdash;no, Ivan could not submit to her, and
such submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha could not
help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and reflections
flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room. Another
idea, too, forced itself upon him: <q>What if she loved neither
of them&mdash;neither Ivan nor Dmitri?</q>
</p>

<p>
It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his
own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him
during the last month. <q>What do I know about love and women
and how can I decide such questions?</q> he thought reproachfully,
after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was impossible not to
think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense
importance in his brothers' lives and that a great deal
depended upon it.
</p>

<p>
<q>One reptile will devour the other,</q> Ivan had pronounced the
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>
day before, speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan
looked upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was
it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had,
of course, escaped Ivan unawares yesterday, but that only made it
more important. If he felt like that, what chance was there of
peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new grounds for hatred
and hostility in their family? And with which of them was Alyosha
to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them?
He loved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst
of these conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this
maze, and Alyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty, because
his love was always of an active character. He was incapable of
passive love. If he loved any one, he set to work at once to help
him. And to do so he must know what he was aiming at; he must
know for certain what was best for each, and having ascertained
this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of a definite
aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all
sides. <q>It was lacerating,</q> as was said just now. But what could he
understand even in this <q>laceration</q>? He did not understand the
first word in this perplexing maze.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to
Ivan, who had already got up to go, <q>A minute! Stay another
minute! I want to hear the opinion of this person here whom I
trust absolutely. Don't go away,</q> she added, addressing Madame
Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down beside her, and Madame
Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear
friends,</q> she began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine
tears of suffering, and Alyosha's heart warmed to her at once.
<q>You, Alexey Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable
scene, and saw what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch,
he did. What he thought of me yesterday I don't know. I
only know one thing, that if it were repeated to-day, this minute, I
should express the same feelings again as yesterday&mdash;the same feelings,
the same words, the same actions. You remember my actions,
Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them</q> ... (as
she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). <q>I must tell you that
I can't get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don't even
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
know whether I still love <emph>him</emph>. I feel <emph>pity</emph> for him, and that
is a poor sign of love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I
shouldn't be sorry for him now, but should hate him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha
shuddered inwardly. <q>That girl is truthful and sincere,</q> he
thought, <q>and she does not love Dmitri any more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's true, that's true,</q> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait, dear. I haven't told you the chief, the final decision I
came to during the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a
terrible one&mdash;for me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to
change it&mdash;nothing. It will be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful
and generous adviser, the one friend I have in the world,
Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep insight into the heart, approves
and commends my decision. He knows it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I approve of it,</q> Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive
my calling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch,
too, to tell me before my two friends whether I am right.
I feel instinctively that you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are
a dear brother to me),</q> she said again ecstatically, taking his cold
hand in her hot one, <q>I foresee that your decision, your approval, will
bring me peace, in spite of all my sufferings, for, after your words,
I shall be calm and submit&mdash;I feel that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know what you are asking me,</q> said Alyosha, flushing.
<q>I only know that I love you and at this moment wish for your
happiness more than my own!... But I know nothing about
such affairs,</q> something impelled him to add hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
<q>In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief
thing is honor and duty and something higher&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;but
higher perhaps even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible
feeling in my heart, and it compels me irresistibly. But it
may all be put in two words. I've already decided, even if he marries
that&mdash;creature,</q> she began solemnly, <q>whom I never, never can
forgive, <emph>even then I will not abandon him</emph>. Henceforward I will
never, never abandon him!</q> she cried, breaking into a sort of pale,
hysterical ecstasy. <q>Not that I would run after him continually,
get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away to another
town&mdash;where you like&mdash;but I will watch over him all my life&mdash;I
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
will watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy
with that woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let
him come to me and he will find a friend, a sister.... Only a
sister, of course, and so for ever; but he will learn at least that that
sister is really his sister, who loves him and has sacrificed all her life
to him. I will gain my point. I will insist on his knowing me and
confiding entirely in me, without reserve,</q> she cried, in a sort of
frenzy. <q>I will be a god to whom he can pray&mdash;and that, at least,
he owes me for his treachery and for what I suffered yesterday
through him. And let him see that all my life I will be true to him
and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue and betraying
me. I will&mdash;I will become nothing but a means for his happiness,
or&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;an instrument, a machine for his happiness,
and that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may
see that all his life! That's my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully
approves me.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea
with more dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried
and crude. It was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed
that she was still smarting from yesterday's insult, and that her pride
craved satisfaction. She felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened,
an unpleasant look came into her eyes. Alyosha at once saw
it and felt a pang of sympathy. His brother Ivan made it worse
by adding:
</p>

<p>
<q>I've only expressed my own view,</q> he said. <q>From any one
else, this would have been affected and overstrained, but from you&mdash;no.
Any other woman would have been wrong, but you are
right. I don't know how to explain it, but I see that you are absolutely
genuine and, therefore, you are right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But that's only for the moment. And what does this moment
stand for? Nothing but yesterday's insult.</q> Madame Hohlakov obviously
had not intended to interfere, but she could not refrain
from this very just comment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite so, quite so,</q> cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously
annoyed at being interrupted, <q>in any one else this moment
would be only due to yesterday's impression and would be only a
moment. But with Katerina Ivanovna's character, that moment
will last all her life. What for any one else would be only a
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
promise is for her an everlasting burdensome, grim perhaps, but
unflagging duty. And she will be sustained by the feeling of this
duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna, will henceforth
be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your own
heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will
be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment
of a bold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate
in any case, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of
it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make
you resigned to everything else.</q>
</p>

<p>
This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with
intention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke
ironically and with intention.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!</q> Madame Hohlakov cried
again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know
what you will say!</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears.
Alyosha got up from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's nothing, nothing!</q> she went on through her tears. <q>I'm upset,
I didn't sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends
as you and your brother I still feel strong&mdash;for I know&mdash;you two
will never desert me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow&mdash;perhaps to-morrow&mdash;and
to leave you for a long time&mdash;And, unluckily, it's unavoidable,</q>
Ivan said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>To-morrow&mdash;to Moscow!</q> her face was suddenly contorted;
<q>but&mdash;but, dear me, how fortunate!</q> she cried in a voice suddenly
changed. In one instant there was no trace left of her tears. She
underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha.
Instead of a poor, insulted girl, weeping in a sort of <q>laceration,</q>
he saw a woman completely self-possessed and even exceedingly
pleased, as though something agreeable had just happened.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,</q> she
corrected herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. <q>Such a
friend as you are could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy
at losing you.</q> She rushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his
hands, pressed them warmly. <q>But what is fortunate is that you
will be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
all the horror of my present position. You can speak with complete
openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will know
how to do that. You can't think how wretched I was yesterday
and this morning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful
letter&mdash;for one can never tell such things in a letter.... Now it
will be easy for me to write, for you will see them and explain
everything. Oh, how glad I am! But I am only glad of that,
believe me. Of course, no one can take your place.... I will run
at once to write the letter,</q> she finished suddenly, and took a step
as though to go out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so
desperately anxious to hear?</q> cried Madame Hohlakov. There was
a sarcastic, angry note in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I had not forgotten that,</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to
a sudden standstill, <q>and why are you so antagonistic at such a
moment?</q> she added, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. <q>What
I said, I repeat. I must have his opinion. More than that, I must
have his decision! As he says, so it shall be. You see how anxious
I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch.... But what's the
matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!</q> Alyosha
cried suddenly in distress.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? What?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You
said that on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not
glad of that but sorry to be&mdash;losing a friend. But that was acting,
too&mdash;you were playing a part&mdash;as in a theater!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a theater? What? What do you mean?</q> exclaimed Katerina
Ivanovna, profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him,
you persist in telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is going,</q>
said Alyosha breathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not
sit down.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you talking about? I don't understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ...
I know I am not saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same,</q>
Alyosha went on in the same shaking and broken voice. <q>What I
see is that perhaps you don't love Dmitri at all ... and never
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>
have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri, too, has never loved
you ... and only esteems you.... I really don't know how I
dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody
here will tell the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What truth?</q> cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical
ring in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll tell you,</q> Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though
he were jumping from the top of a house. <q>Call Dmitri; I will fetch
him&mdash;and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan's
and join your hands. For you're torturing Ivan, simply because you
love him&mdash;and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through
<q>self-laceration</q>&mdash;with an unreal love&mdash;because you've persuaded
yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha broke off and was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot&mdash;that's what
you are!</q> Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her
lips were moving with anger.
</p>

<p>
Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,</q> he said, with an expression
Alyosha had never seen in his face before&mdash;an expression of
youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling. <q>Katerina
Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the time that
I cared for her&mdash;though I never said a word of my love to her&mdash;she
knew, but she didn't care for me. I have never been her friend
either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my friendship.
She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revenged
with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually
receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that
first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult&mdash;that's what her
heart is like! She has talked to me of nothing but her love for
him. I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina Ivanovna, you
really love him. And the more he insults you, the more you love
him&mdash;that's your <q>laceration.</q> You love him just as he is; you love
him for insulting you. If he reformed, you'd give him up at once
and cease to love him. But you need him so as to contemplate continually
your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity. And
it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a great deal of humiliation
and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride....
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>
I am too young and I've loved you too much. I know that I ought
not to say this, that it would be more dignified on my part simply
to leave you, and it would be less offensive for you. But I am going
far away, and shall never come back.... It is for ever. I don't
want to sit beside a <q>laceration.</q>... But I don't know how to
speak now. I've said everything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna;
you can't be angry with me, for I am a hundred times more
severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never see
you again. Good-by! I don't want your hand. You have tortured
me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this moment.
I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand. <q>Den
Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,</q></q> he added, with a forced smile,
showing, however, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he
knew him by heart&mdash;which Alyosha would never have believed.
He went out of the room without saying good-by even to his hostess,
Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha clasped his hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan!</q> he cried desperately after him. <q>Come back, Ivan! No,
nothing will induce him to come back now!</q> he cried again, regretfully
realizing it; <q>but it's my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan
spoke angrily, wrongly. Unjustly and angrily. He must come back
here, come back,</q> Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an
angel,</q> Madame Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to
Alyosha. <q>I will do my utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from
going.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha,
but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble
notes in her hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,</q> she
began, addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice,
as though nothing had happened. <q>A week&mdash;yes, I think it was a
week ago&mdash;Dmitri Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust
action&mdash;a very ugly action. There is a low tavern here, and in it he
met that discharged officer, that captain, whom your father used
to employ in some business. Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his
temper with this captain, seized him by the beard and dragged him
out into the street and for some distance along it, in that insulting
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>
fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a child, who is at
the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for
his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while every one
laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot
think without indignation of that disgraceful action of <emph>his</emph> ...
one of those actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be
capable in his anger ... and in his passions! I can't describe it
even.... I can't find my words. I've made inquiries about his
victim, and find he is quite a poor man. His name is Snegiryov. He
did something wrong in the army and was discharged. I can't tell
you what. And now he has sunk into terrible destitution, with
his family&mdash;an unhappy family of sick children, and, I believe, an
insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to
work as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought
if you ... that is I thought ... I don't know. I am so confused.
You see, I wanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,
to go to him, to find some excuse to go to them&mdash;I mean to that
captain&mdash;oh, goodness, how badly I explain it!&mdash;and delicately,
carefully, as only you know how to</q> (Alyosha blushed), <q>manage
to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles. He will be
sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,
rather, what do I mean? You see it's not by way of compensation
to prevent him from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to),
but simply a token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch's betrothed, not from himself.... But you
know.... I would go myself, but you'll know how to do it ever
so much better. He lives in Lake Street, in the house of a woman
called Kalmikov.... For God's sake, Alexey Fyodorovitch, do it
for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired. Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
She turned and disappeared behind the portière so quickly that
Alyosha had not time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak.
He longed to beg her pardon, to blame himself, to say something,
for his heart was full and he could not bear to go out of the room
without it. But Madame Hohlakov took him by the hand and drew
him along with her. In the hall she stopped him again as before.
</p>

<p>
<q>She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,
generous,</q> she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. <q>Oh, how I love
her, especially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything!
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, you didn't know, but I must tell you,
that we all, all&mdash;both her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even&mdash;have
been hoping and praying for nothing for the last month but that
she may give up your favorite Dmitri, who takes no notice of her
and does not care for her, and may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch&mdash;such
an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her more than
anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring it about,
and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But she has been crying&mdash;she has been wounded again,</q> cried
Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Never trust a woman's tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never
for the women in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, you are spoiling him,</q> Lise's little voice cried from behind
the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,</q> Alyosha
repeated unconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse
for his indiscretion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel.
I am ready to say so a thousand times over.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel?</q> Lise's voice was
heard again.
</p>

<p>
<q>I somehow fancied all at once,</q> Alyosha went on as though he
had not heard Lise, <q>that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid
thing.... What will happen now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To whom, to whom?</q> cried Lise. <q>Mamma, you really want
to be the death of me. I ask you and you don't answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the moment the maid ran in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ...
hysterics.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the matter?</q> cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety.
<q>Mamma, I shall be having hysterics, and not she!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream, don't persecute me. At
your age one can't know everything that grown-up people know.
I'll come and tell you everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy
on us! I am coming, I am coming.... Hysterics is a good sign,
Alexey Fyodorovitch; it's an excellent thing that she is hysterical.
That's just as it ought to be. In such cases I am always against
the woman, against all these feminine tears and hysterics. Run and
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>
say, Yulia, that I'll fly to her. As for Ivan Fyodorovitch's going
away like that, it's her own fault. But he won't go away. Lise, for
mercy's sake, don't scream! Oh, yes; you are not screaming. It's I
am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted, delighted,
delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how
young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he
said all that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>savant</foreign>, and all of a sudden he behaved so
warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine,
like you.... And the way he repeated that German verse, it was
just like you! But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch,
make haste to carry out her commission, and then make haste back.
Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy's sake, don't keep
Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would
have opened the door to see Lise.
</p>

<p>
<q>On no account,</q> cried Lise. <q>On no account now. Speak
through the door. How have you come to be an angel? That's
the only thing I want to know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't dare to go away like that!</q> Lise was beginning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lise, I have a real sorrow! I'll be back directly, but I have a
great, great sorrow!</q>
</p>

<p>
And he ran out of the room.

<head>Chapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage</head>

<p>
He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been
before. He had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what?
In a love-affair. <q>But what do I know about it? What can I tell
about such things?</q> he repeated to himself for the hundredth time,
flushing crimson. <q>Oh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame
is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly
have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me
to reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>
together?</q> Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join
their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. <q>Though I acted
quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,</q> he concluded
suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Katerina Ivanovna's commission took him to Lake Street, and his
brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street.
Alyosha decided to go to him in any case before going to the captain,
though he had a presentiment that he would not find his
brother. He suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his
way now, but he must find him anyhow. Time was passing: the
thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute
from the time he set off from the monastery.
</p>

<p>
There was one point which interested him particularly about
Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the captain's
son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying,
the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy
who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had
done to hurt him. Now Alyosha felt practically certain of this,
though he could not have said why. Thinking of another subject
was a relief, and he resolved to think no more about the <q>mischief</q>
he had done, and not to torture himself with remorse, but to do what
he had to do, let come what would. At that thought he was completely
comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he
felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought
from his father's, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker,
his son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at
Alyosha. <q>He hasn't slept here for the last three nights. Maybe
he has gone away,</q> the old man said in answer to Alyosha's persistent
inquiries. Alyosha saw that he was answering in accordance
with instructions. When he asked whether he were not at Grushenka's
or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke so freely on purpose),
all three looked at him in alarm. <q>They are fond of him,
they are doing their best for him,</q> thought Alyosha. <q>That's good.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little
house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street,
and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary
cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening into the
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the
house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer
to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood
that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door
across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to be a simple
cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open the
door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew
from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family. <q>Either
they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are
waiting for me to open the door. I'd better knock first,</q> and he
knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval of
perhaps ten seconds.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who's there?</q> shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.
</p>

<p>
Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He
found himself in a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it
was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there
were several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove.
From the stove to the window on the left was a string running
across the room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was a
bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with
knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print-covered
pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other
there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was
screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this
curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The
rough square table of plain wood had been moved into the middle
window. The three windows, which consisted each of four tiny
greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and were close shut, so
that the room was not very light and rather stuffy. On the table
was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs, a half-eaten
piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.
</p>

<p>
A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was
sitting on a chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and
yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she
was ill. But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in the
poor woman's eyes&mdash;a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty
pride. And while he was talking to her husband, her big brown
eyes moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
and questioning expression. Beside her at the window stood a young
girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but very neatly
dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in. Beside
the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad
sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled
<q>with withered legs,</q> as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches
stood in the corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle
eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man
of forty-five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried eggs. He
was spare, small and weakly built. He had reddish hair and a
scanty light-colored beard, very much like a wisp of tow (this
comparison and the phrase <q>a wisp of tow</q> flashed at once into
Alyosha's mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).
It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there
was no other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he
leapt up from the bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping
his mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to
come to!</q> the girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man
spun round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited
and breaking voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,</q> he turned
again to Alyosha, <q>what has brought you to&mdash;our retreat?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had
seen him. There was something angular, flurried and irritable
about him. Though he had obviously just been drinking, he was not
drunk. There was extraordinary impudence in his expression, and
yet, strange to say, at the same time there was fear. He looked like
a man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to
it, and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself.
Or, better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is
horribly afraid you will hit him. In his words and in the intonation
of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor, at times
spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting from one
tone to another. The question about <q>our retreat</q> he had asked as
it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close
to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed
in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>
checked trousers of an extremely light color, long out of fashion,
and of very thin material. They were so crumpled and so short
that he looked as though he had grown out of them like a boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Alexey Karamazov,</q> Alyosha began in reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>I quite understand that, sir,</q> the gentleman snapped out at
once to assure him that he knew who he was already. <q>I am Captain
Snegiryov, sir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led
you&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with
you&mdash;if only you allow me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That's what
they used to say in the old comedies, <q>kindly be seated,</q></q> and with
a rapid gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden
chair, not upholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of
the room; then, taking another similar chair for himself, he sat down
facing Alyosha, so close to him that their knees almost touched.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian
infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though
I might not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my
life I've learnt to say <q>sir.</q> It's a word you use when you've come
down in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's very true,</q> smiled Alyosha. <q>But is it used involuntarily
or on purpose?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I didn't
use the word <q>sir</q> all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water
I began to say <q>sir.</q> It's the work of a higher power. I see you are
interested in contemporary questions, but how can I have excited
your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise
of hospitality?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I've come&mdash;about that business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>About what business?</q> the captain interrupted impatiently.
</p>

<p>
<q>About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,</q>
Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
<q>What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About
my <q>wisp of tow,</q> then?</q> He moved closer so that his knees positively
knocked against Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed
like a thread.
</p>

<p>
<q>What wisp of tow?</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is come to complain of me, father!</q> cried a voice familiar
to Alyosha&mdash;the voice of the schoolboy&mdash;from behind the curtain.
<q>I bit his finger just now.</q> The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha
saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and
the chair in the corner under the ikons. The boy lay covered by
his coat and an old wadded quilt. He was evidently unwell, and,
judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a fever. He looked at
Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home and could
not be touched.
</p>

<p>
<q>What! Did he bite your finger?</q> The captain jumped up
from his chair. <q>Was it your finger he bit?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There
were six of them against him alone. I went up to him, and he
threw a stone at me and then another at my head. I asked him
what I had done to him. And then he rushed at me and bit my
finger badly, I don't know why.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll thrash him, sir, at once&mdash;this minute!</q> The captain jumped
up from his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ...
I don't want him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And do you suppose I'd thrash him? That I'd take my Ilusha
and thrash him before you for your satisfaction? Would you
like it done at once, sir?</q> said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha,
as though he were going to attack him. <q>I am sorry about your
finger, sir; but instead of thrashing Ilusha, would you like me to
chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to
satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers would be
enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won't ask for the
fifth one too?</q> He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every
feature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely
defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think I understand it all now,</q> said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,
still keeping his seat. <q>So your boy is a good boy, he loves
his father, and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant....
Now I understand it,</q> he repeated thoughtfully. <q>But my brother
