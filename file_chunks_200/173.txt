of the people. The case of Richard is interesting
because it's national. Though to us it's absurd to cut off a man's
head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>
we have our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical
pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines
in Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes,
<q>on its meek eyes,</q> every one must have seen it. It's peculiarly Russian.
He describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too
heavy a load and cannot move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely,
beats it at last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication
of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over and over again. <q>However
weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.</q> The nag strains,
and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature on its weeping,
on its <q>meek eyes.</q> The frantic beast tugs and draws the load,
trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort
of unnatural spasmodic action&mdash;it's awful in Nekrassov. But that's
only a horse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars
have taught us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it.
But men, too, can be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman
and his wife beat their own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven.
I have an exact account of it. The papa was glad that the birch was
covered with twigs. <q>It stings more,</q> said he, and so he began stinging
his daughter. I know for a fact there are people who at every
blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases
progressively at every blow they inflict. They beat for a
minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more
savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it
gasps, <q>Daddy! daddy!</q> By some diabolical unseemly chance the case
was brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people
have long called a barrister <q>a conscience for hire.</q> The counsel
protests in his client's defense. <q>It's such a simple thing,</q> he says,
<q>an everyday domestic event. A father corrects his child. To our
shame be it said, it is brought into court.</q> The jury, convinced by
him, give a favorable verdict. The public roars with delight that
the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn't there! I would have
proposed to raise a subscription in his honor! Charming pictures.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But I've still better things about children. I've collected a
great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little
girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, <q>most worthy
and respectable people, of good education and breeding.</q> You see,
I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people,
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>
this love of torturing children, and children only. To all other types
of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like
cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting
children, even fond of children themselves in that sense.
It's just their defenselessness that tempts the tormentor, just the
angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal,
that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of course, a demon
lies hidden&mdash;the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the
screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off the
chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease,
and so on.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture
by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her,
kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they
went to greater refinements of cruelty&mdash;shut her up all night in the
cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken
up at night (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound
sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her face
and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her
mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor
child's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who
can't even understand what's done to her, should beat her little aching
heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her
meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you
understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice?
Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted?
Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he
could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that
diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole
world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to <q>dear, kind
God</q>! I say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they
have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But
these little ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not
yourself. I'll leave off if you like.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind. I want to suffer too,</q> muttered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so characteristic,
and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian
antiquities. I've forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>
in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century, and
long live the Liberator of the People! There was in those days a
general of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates, one
of those men&mdash;somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then&mdash;who, retiring
from the service into a life of leisure, are convinced that
they've earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects. There
were such men then. So our general, settled on his property of two
thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor neighbors
as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of
hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys&mdash;all mounted,
and in uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw
a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general's favorite hound.
<q>Why is my favorite dog lame?</q> He is told that the boy threw a
stone that hurt the dog's paw. <q>So you did it.</q> The general looked
the child up and down. <q>Take him.</q> He was taken&mdash;taken from
his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that morning the
general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his dependents,
dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting
parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in
front of them all stands the mother of the child. The child is
brought from the lock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day,
a capital day for hunting. The general orders the child to be undressed;
the child is stripped naked. He shivers, numb with terror,
not daring to cry.... <q>Make him run,</q> commands the general.
<q>Run! run!</q> shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... <q>At him!</q>
yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the child.
The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother's
eyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable
of administering his estates. Well&mdash;what did he deserve? To be
shot? To be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak,
Alyosha!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To be shot,</q> murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a
pale, twisted smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo!</q> cried Ivan, delighted. <q>If even you say so.... You're
a pretty monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart,
Alyosha Karamazov!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What I said was absurd, but&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's just the point, that <q>but</q>!</q> cried Ivan. <q>Let me tell you,
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>
novice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world
stands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass
in it without them. We know what we know!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you know?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand nothing,</q> Ivan went on, as though in delirium.
<q>I don't want to understand anything now. I want to stick to the
fact. I made up my mind long ago not to understand. If I try
to understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have
determined to stick to the fact.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you trying me?</q> Alyosha cried, with sudden distress.
<q>Will you say what you mean at last?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to. You
are dear to me, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up
to your Zossima.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer.
Of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked
from its crust to its center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed
my subject on purpose. I am a bug, and I recognize in all humility
that I cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is. Men
are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they
wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though they knew
they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity them. With
my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is that
there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows
effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level&mdash;but
that's only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can't consent
to live by it! What comfort is it to me that there are none
guilty and that cause follows effect simply and directly, and that
I know it?&mdash;I must have justice, or I will destroy myself. And not
justice in some remote infinite time and space, but here on earth, and
that I could see myself. I have believed in it. I want to see it, and
if I am dead by then, let me rise again, for if it all happens without
me, it will be too unfair. Surely I haven't suffered, simply that I,
my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the soil of the future
harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my own eyes
the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace
his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly understands
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>
what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are
built on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the
children, and what am I to do about them? That's a question I
can't answer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers
of questions, but I've only taken the children, because in their case
what I mean is so unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer
to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children to do with it,
tell me, please? It's beyond all comprehension why they should suffer,
and why they should pay for the harmony. Why should they,
too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future?
I understand solidarity in sin among men. I understand solidarity
in retribution, too; but there can be no such solidarity with
children. And if it is really true that they must share responsibility
for all their fathers' crimes, such a truth is not of this world and is
beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that the
child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn't
grow up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh,
Alyosha, I am not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an
upheaval of the universe it will be, when everything in heaven and
earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has
lived cries aloud: <q>Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.</q>
When the mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to the
dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears, <q>Thou art just, O Lord!</q>
then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all
will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I can't
accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take
my own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen
that if I live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps,
may cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the
child's torturer, <q>Thou art just, O Lord!</q> but I don't want to cry
aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself,
and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether. It's not worth
the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast
with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated
tears to <q>dear, kind God</q>! It's not worth it, because those
tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can be no
harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them? Is
it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good
can hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And
what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I
want to embrace. I don't want more suffering. And if the sufferings
of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary
to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth
such a price. I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor
who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her
forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for
the immeasurable suffering of her mother's heart. But the sufferings
of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive
the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is
so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there
in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive
and could forgive? I don't want harmony. From love for humanity
I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged
suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering
and unsatisfied indignation, <emph>even if I were wrong</emph>. Besides, too high
a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much
to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket,
and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as
possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept,
Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's rebellion,</q> murmured Alyosha, looking down.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,</q> said Ivan earnestly.
<q>One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me
yourself, I challenge you&mdash;answer. Imagine that you are creating
a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in
the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential
and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature&mdash;that baby
beating its breast with its fist, for instance&mdash;and to found that edifice
on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on
those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I wouldn't consent,</q> said Alyosha softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building
it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of
the unexpiated blood of a little victim? And accepting it would
remain happy for ever?</q>
</p>

<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>

<p>
<q>No, I can't admit it. Brother,</q> said Alyosha suddenly, with
flashing eyes, <q>you said just now, is there a being in the whole world
who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? But there
is a Being and He can forgive everything, all and for all, because
He gave His innocent blood for all and everything. You have forgotten
Him, and on Him is built the edifice, and it is to Him they
cry aloud, <q>Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten
Him; on the contrary I've been wondering all the time how
it was you did not bring Him in before, for usually all arguments
on your side put Him in the foreground. Do you know, Alyosha&mdash;don't
laugh! I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste
another ten minutes on me, I'll tell it to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You wrote a poem?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, no, I didn't write it,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>and I've never written
two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose
and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You
will be my first reader&mdash;that is listener. Why should an author
forego even one listener?</q> smiled Ivan. <q>Shall I tell it to you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am all attention,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>My poem is called <q>The Grand Inquisitor</q>; it's a ridiculous thing,
but I want to tell it to you.</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor</head>

<p>
<q>Even this must have a preface&mdash;that is, a literary preface,</q>
laughed Ivan, <q rend='pre'>and I am a poor hand at making one. You
see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that
time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry
to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante,
in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to
give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the
angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those
days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo's <hi rend='italic'>Notre Dame de
Paris</hi> an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>
in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor
of the birth of the dauphin. It was called <hi rend='italic'>Le bon jugement de la
très sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie</hi>, and she appears herself on the
stage and pronounces her <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bon jugement</foreign>.
Similar plays, chiefly from the Old Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too,
up to the times of Peter the Great. But besides plays there were
all sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world, in which
the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when
required. In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating,
copying, and even composing such poems&mdash;and even under
the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of course, from
the Greek), <hi rend='italic'>The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell</hi>, with
descriptions as bold as Dante's. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel
Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners
and their punishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy
set of sinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom
of the lake so that they can't swim out, and <q>these God forgets</q>&mdash;an
expression of extraordinary depth and force. And so Our
Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the throne of God and begs
for mercy for all in hell&mdash;for all she has seen there, indiscriminately.
Her conversation with God is immensely interesting. She beseeches
Him, she will not desist, and when God points to the hands and feet
of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, <q>How can I forgive His
tormentors?</q> she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all the angels
and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all
without distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite
of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the
sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting,
<q>Thou art just, O Lord, in this judgment.</q> Well, my poem would
have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time. He comes
on the scene in my poem, but He says nothing, only appears and
passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed since He promised to come
in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet wrote, <q>Behold, I
come quickly</q>; <q>Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither
the Son, but the Father,</q> as He Himself predicted on earth. But
humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love.
Oh, with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased
to see signs from heaven.</q>
</p>

<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>No signs from heaven come to-day</l>
<l>To add to what the heart doth say.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is
true there were many miracles in those days. There were saints
who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to
their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But
the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among
men of the truth of these miracles. And just then there appeared
in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. <q>A huge star like
to a torch</q> (that is, to a church) <q>fell on the sources of the waters
and they became bitter.</q> These heretics began blasphemously denying
miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more
ardent in their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as
before, awaited His coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to
suffer and die for Him as before. And so many ages mankind had
prayed with faith and fervor, <q>O Lord our God, hasten Thy coming,</q>
so many ages called upon Him, that in His infinite mercy He
deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He had
come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits,
as is written in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute
faith in the truth of his words, bore witness that
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,</l>
<l>Weary and worn, the Heavenly King</l>
<l>Our mother, Russia, came to bless,</l>
<l>And through our land went wandering.</l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
And that certainly was so, I assure you.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people,
to the tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him
like children. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible
time of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to
the glory of God, and <q>in the splendid <foreign rend='italic'>auto da
fé</foreign> the wicked heretics
were burnt.</q> Oh, of course, this was not the coming in which
He will appear according to His promise at the end of time in all
His heavenly glory, and which will be sudden <q>as lightning flashing
from east to west.</q> No, He visited His children only for a moment,
and there where the flames were crackling round the heretics.
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>
In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in that human
shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteen centuries
ago. He came down to the <q>hot pavements</q> of the southern
town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, <foreign
lang='la' rend='italic'>ad majorem gloriam Dei</foreign>,
been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent
<foreign rend='italic'>auto da fé</foreign>, in the presence of the king, the
court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming ladies of the
court, and the whole population of Seville.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one
recognized Him. That might be one of the best passages in the
poem. I mean, why they recognized Him. The people are irresistibly
drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him,
follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile
of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, light
and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people,
stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands
to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact
with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd,
blind from childhood, cries out, <q>O Lord, heal me and I shall see
Thee!</q> and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man
sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet.
Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. <q>It is
He&mdash;it is He!</q> all repeat. <q>It must be He, it can be no one but
Him!</q> He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment
when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin.
In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent
citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. <q>He will raise your
child,</q> the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming
to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of
the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. <q>If it is Thou,
raise my child!</q> she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession
halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks
with compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, <q>Maiden,
arise!</q> and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and
looks round, smiling with wide-open wondering eyes, holding a
bunch of white roses they had put in her hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that
moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the
<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>
cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a
withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of
light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was
the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman
Church&mdash;at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old, monk's cassock.
At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and
slaves and the <q>holy guard.</q> He stops at the sight of the crowd and
watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the
coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens.
He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire.
He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is
his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and
trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes
way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay
hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down
to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the
people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to
the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy
Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed
by the dark, burning, <q>breathless</q> night of Seville. The air is <q>fragrant
with laurel and lemon.</q> In the pitch darkness the iron door
of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself
comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at
once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or
two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on
the table and speaks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Is it Thou? Thou?</q> but receiving no answer, he adds at once,
<q>Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know
too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add
anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou
come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou
knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be to-morrow? I
know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou
or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee
and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very
people who have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest
sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest
Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,</q> he added with thoughtful
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>
penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?</q> Alyosha,
who had been listening in silence, said with a smile. <q>Is it simply
a wild fantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man&mdash;some impossible
<foreign rend='italic'>quiproquo</foreign>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Take it as the last,</q> said Ivan, laughing, <q>if you are so corrupted
by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic. If
you like it to be a case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,</q>
he went on, laughing, <q>the old man was ninety, and he might well
be crazy over his set idea. He might have been struck by the appearance
of the Prisoner. It might, in fact, be simply his ravings,
the delusion of an old man of ninety, over-excited
by the <foreign rend='italic'>auto da fé</foreign>
of a hundred heretics the day before. But does it matter to us after
all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy? All that
matters is that the old man should speak out, should speak openly of
what he has thought in silence for ninety years.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not
say a word?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's inevitable in any case,</q> Ivan laughed again. <q>The old
man has told Him He hasn't the right to add anything to what He
has said of old. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of
Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. <q>All has been given by
Thee to the Pope,</q> they say, <q>and all, therefore, is still in the Pope's
hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all. Thou
must not meddle for the time, at least.</q> That's how they speak and
write too&mdash;the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read it myself in the
works of their theologians. <q>Hast Thou the right to reveal to us
one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come?</q>
my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. <q>No,
Thou hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said
of old, and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst
exalt when Thou wast on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew
will encroach on men's freedom of faith; for it will be manifest
as a miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than
anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago. Didst Thou not
often say then, <q>I will make you free</q>? But now Thou hast seen
these <q>free</q> men,</q> the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile.
<q>Yes, we've paid dearly for it,</q> he goes on, looking sternly at Him,
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>
<q>but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen
centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is
ended and over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over for
good? Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be
wroth with me. But let me tell Thee that now, to-day, people are
more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom, yet they
have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet.
But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst? Was this
Thy freedom?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't understand again,</q> Alyosha broke in. <q>Is he ironical, is
he jesting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his
Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done
so to make men happy. <q>For now</q> (he is speaking of the Inquisition,
of course) <q>for the first time it has become possible to think of the
happiness of men. Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels
be happy? Thou wast warned,</q> he says to Him. <q>Thou hast had
no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst not listen to
those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men
might be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst
hand on the work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established
by Thy word, Thou hast given to us the right to bind and
to unbind, and now, of course, Thou canst not think of taking it
away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder us?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what's the meaning of <q>no lack of admonitions and warnings</q>?</q>
asked Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and
non-existence,</q>
the old man goes on, <q rend='pre'>the great spirit talked with Thee in
the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he <q>tempted</q>
Thee. Is that so? And could anything truer be said than what he
revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject, and
what in the books is called <q>the temptation</q>? And yet if there
has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle, it took place on
that day, on the day of the three temptations. The statement of
those three questions was itself the miracle. If it were possible to
imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions
of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books, and that we
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>
had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to do so had gathered
together all the wise men of the earth&mdash;rulers, chief priests,
learned men, philosophers, poets&mdash;and had set them the task to invent
three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but
express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history
of the world and of humanity&mdash;dost Thou believe that all the
wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth
and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to
Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness? From
those questions alone, from the miracle of their statement, we can
see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence,
but with the absolute and eternal. For in those three questions the
whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together
into one whole, and foretold, and in them are united all the unsolved
historical contradictions of human nature. At the time it could not
be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that fifteen
hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three
questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly
fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>Judge Thyself who was right&mdash;Thou or he who questioned
Thee then? Remember the first question; its meaning, in other
words, was this: <q>Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going
with empty hands, with some promise of freedom which men in
their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand,
which they fear and dread&mdash;for nothing has ever been more insupportable
for a man and a human society than freedom. But seest
Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness? Turn
them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of
sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest Thou
withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.</q> But Thou wouldst
not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking,
what is that freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread?
Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou
know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth
will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome
Thee, and all will follow him, crying, <q>Who can compare with this
beast? He has given us fire from heaven!</q> Dost Thou know that
the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>
sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only
hunger? <q>Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!</q> that's what
they'll write on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and
with which they will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood
will rise a new building; the terrible tower of Babel will be built
again, and though, like the one of old, it will not be finished, yet
Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short
the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come back
to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower. They will
seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall
be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to us,
<q>Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't
given it!</q> And then we shall finish building their tower, for he
finishes the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them
in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never,
never can they feed themselves without us! No science will give
them bread so long as they remain free. In the end they will lay
their freedom at our feet, and say to us, <q>Make us your slaves, but
feed us.</q> They will understand themselves, at last, that freedom
and bread enough for all are inconceivable together, for never, never
will they be able to share between them! They will be convinced,
too, that they can never be free, for they are weak, vicious, worthless
and rebellious. Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven,
but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes
of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if for the
sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is
to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures
who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread
for the sake of the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens
of thousands of the great and strong, while the millions, numerous
as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love Thee, must exist only
for the sake of the great and strong? No, we care for the weak
too. They are sinful and rebellious, but in the end they too will
become obedient. They will marvel at us and look on us as gods, because
we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so
dreadful and to rule over them&mdash;so awful it will seem to them to be
free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule
them in Thy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
Thee come to us again. That deception will be our suffering, for we
shall be forced to lie.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>This is the significance of the first question in the
wilderness, and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom
which Thou hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies
hid the great secret of this world. Choosing <q>bread,</q> Thou wouldst
have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity&mdash;to
find some one to worship. So long as man remains free he strives
for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to
worship. But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute,
so that all men would agree at once to worship it. For these
pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other
can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and
worship; what is essential is that all may be <emph>together</emph> in it. This
craving for <emph>community</emph> of worship is the chief misery of every man
individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For
the sake of common worship they've slain each other with the
sword. They have set up gods and challenged one another, <q>Put
away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and
your gods!</q> And so it will be to the end of the world, even when
gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols
just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but have known,
this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject the
one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow
down to Thee alone&mdash;the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast
rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold
what Thou didst further. And all again in the name of freedom!
I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find
some one quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom
with which the ill-fated creature is born. But only one who can
appease their conscience can take over their freedom. In bread there
was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread, and man will
worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if some
one else gains possession of his conscience&mdash;oh! then he will cast
away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience.
In that Thou wast right. For the secret of man's being is
not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable
conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>
on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth,
though he had bread in abundance. That is true. But what happened?
Instead of taking men's freedom from them, Thou didst
make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man prefers
peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of
good and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom
of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,
instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience
of man at rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional,
vague and enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond
the strength of men, acting as though Thou didst not love them at
all&mdash;Thou who didst come to give Thy life for them! Instead of
taking possession of men's freedom, Thou didst increase it, and burdened
the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever.
Thou didst desire man's free love, that he should follow Thee freely,
enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the rigid ancient
law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is
good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his
guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even
Thy image and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful
burden of free choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth
is not in Thee, for they could not have been left in greater confusion
and suffering than Thou hast caused, laying upon them so many
cares and unanswerable problems.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for
the destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it.
Yet what was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers
alone, able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience
of these impotent rebels for their happiness&mdash;those forces are miracle,
mystery and authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast
set the example for doing so. When the wise and dread spirit set
Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee, <q>If Thou
wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself
down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up lest he
fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou
art the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in
Thy Father.</q> But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself
down. Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and well, like God;
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>
but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods? Oh, Thou
didst know then that in taking one step, in making one movement
to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have
lost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces
against that earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise
spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are
there many like Thee? And couldst Thou believe for one moment
that men, too, could face such a temptation? Is the nature
of men such, that they can reject miracle, and at the great
moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing
spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?
Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books,
would be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the
earth, and Thou didst hope that man, following Thee, would cling
to God and not ask for a miracle. But Thou didst not know that
when man rejects miracle he rejects God too; for man seeks not so
much God as the miraculous. And as man cannot bear to be without
the miraculous, he will create new miracles of his own for himself,
and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft, though he
might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou
didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee,
mocking and reviling Thee, <q>Come down from the cross and we will
believe that Thou art He.</q> Thou didst not come down, for again
Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and didst crave faith
given freely, not based on miracle. Thou didst crave for free love
and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has
overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highly of men
therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by nature.
Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon
them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is
weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he,
can he do what Thou didst? By showing him so much respect,
Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him, for Thou didst ask far
too much from him&mdash;Thou who hast loved him more than Thyself!
Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less of him. That
would have been more like love, for his burden would have been
lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now
rebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>
pride of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting
and barring out the teacher at school. But their childish delight will
end; it will cost them dear. They will cast down temples and
drench the earth with blood. But they will see at last, the foolish
children, that, though they are rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable
to keep up their own rebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears,
they will recognize at last that He who created them rebels must
have meant to mock at them. They will say this in despair, and
their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make them more
unhappy still, for man's nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in the
end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and
unhappiness&mdash;that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear
so much for their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in
image, that he saw all those who took part in the first resurrection
and that there were of each tribe twelve thousand. But if there
were so many of them, they must have been not men but gods.
They had borne Thy cross, they had endured scores of years in the
barren, hungry wilderness, living upon locusts and roots&mdash;and Thou
mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of
free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy name. But remember
that they were only some thousands; and what of the rest? And
how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not endure
what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that
it is unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply
come to the elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and
we cannot understand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right
to preach a mystery, and to teach them that it's not the free judgment
of their hearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which
they must follow blindly, even against their conscience. So we have
done. We have corrected Thy work and have founded it upon
<emph>miracle</emph>, <emph>mystery</emph> and <emph>authority</emph>. And men rejoiced
that they were again led like sheep, and that the terrible gift that had brought them
such suffering was, at last, lifted from their hearts. Were we right
teaching them this? Speak! Did we not love mankind, so meekly
acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly lightening their burden,
and permitting their weak nature even sin with our sanction? Why
hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look
silently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
don't want Thy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for
me to hide anything from Thee? Don't I know to Whom I am
speaking? All that I can say is known to Thee already. And is it
for me to conceal from Thee our mystery? Perhaps it is Thy will
to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not working with
Thee, but with <emph>him</emph>&mdash;that is our mystery. It's long&mdash;eight
centuries&mdash;since we have been on <emph>his</emph> side and not on Thine. Just
eight centuries ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn,
that last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of
the earth. We took from him Rome and the sword of Cæsar, and
proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth, though hitherto we
have not been able to complete our work. But whose fault is that?
Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has begun. It has long to
await completion and the earth has yet much to suffer, but we
shall triumph and shall be Cæsars, and then we shall plan the universal
happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then
the sword of Cæsar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst
Thou accepted that last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst
have accomplished all that man seeks on earth&mdash;that is, some one to
worship, some one to keep his conscience, and some means of uniting
all in one unanimous and harmonious ant-heap, for the craving
for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men. Mankind
as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state. There
have been many great nations with great histories, but the more
highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for they
felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide
union. The great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans,
whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue
its people, and they too were but the unconscious expression of the
same craving for universal unity. Hadst Thou taken the world and
Cæsar's purple, Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and
have given universal peace. For who can rule men if not he who
holds their conscience and their bread in his hands? We have taken
the sword of Cæsar, and in taking it, of course, have rejected Thee
and followed <emph>him</emph>. Oh, ages are yet to come of the confusion of
free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having begun
to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,
with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>
feet and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon
the beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written, <q>Mystery.</q>
But then, and only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come
for men. Thou art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the
elect, while we give rest to all. And besides, how many of those
elect, those mighty ones who could become elect, have grown weary
waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will transfer the powers
of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp, and
end by raising their <emph>free</emph> banner against Thee. Thou didst Thyself
lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will no
more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we
shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce
their freedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right
or shall we be lying? They will be convinced that we are right,
for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to
which Thy freedom brought them. Freedom, free thought and
science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face
to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of
them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious
but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and
unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: <q>Yes,
you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back
to you, save us from ourselves!</q></q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the
bread made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without
any miracle. They will see that we do not change the stones to
bread, but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from
our hands than for the bread itself! For they will remember only
too well that in old days, without our help, even the bread they
made turned to stones in their hands, while since they have come
back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in their hands.
Too, too well will they know the value of complete submission!
And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to
blame for their not knowing it?&mdash;speak! Who scattered the flock
and sent it astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come
together again and will submit once more, and then it will be once
for all. Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of
weak creatures such as they are by nature. Oh, we shall persuade
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>
them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst lift them up and
thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them that they
are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike
happiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will
look to us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They
will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be
proud at our being so powerful and clever, that we have been able
to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions. They
will tremble impotently before our wrath, their minds will grow
fearful, they will be quick to shed tears like women and children,
but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter
and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes, we shall set
them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their life
like a child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance. Oh,
we shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they
will love us like children because we allow them to sin. We shall
tell them that every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission,
that we allow them to sin because we love them, and the
punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves. And we shall take
it upon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviors who have
taken on themselves their sins before God. And they will have no
secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them to live with their
wives and mistresses, to have or not to have children&mdash;according to
whether they have been obedient or disobedient&mdash;and they will submit
to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of their
conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer
for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will
save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure
at present in making a free decision for themselves. And all will be
happy, all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand
who rule over them. For only we, we who guard the mystery, shall
be unhappy. There will be thousands of millions of happy babes,
and a hundred thousand sufferers who have taken upon themselves
the curse of the knowledge of good and evil. Peacefully they will
die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and beyond the grave
they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the secret, and
for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven
and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world,
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
it certainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that
Thou wilt come again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen,
the proud and strong, but we will say that they have only saved
themselves, but we have saved all. We are told that the harlot
who sits upon the beast, and holds in her hands the <emph>mystery</emph>, shall
be put to shame, that the weak will rise up again, and will rend her
royal purple and will strip naked her loathsome body. But then I
will stand up and point out to Thee the thousand millions of happy
children who have known no sin. And we who have taken their
sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and say:
<q>Judge us if Thou canst and darest.</q> Know that I fear Thee not.
Know that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on
roots and locusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast
blessed men, and I too was striving to stand among Thy elect, among
the strong and powerful, thirsting <q>to make up the number.</q> But
I awakened and would not serve madness. I turned back and joined
the ranks of those <emph>who have corrected Thy work</emph>. I left the proud
and went back to the humble, for the happiness of the humble.
What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will be
built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock
who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about
the pile on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For
if any one has ever deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I
shall burn Thee. <hi rend='italic'>Dixi.</hi></q></q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with
excitement; when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly
moved and seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but
restrained himself. Now his words came with a rush.
</p>

<p>
<q>But ... that's absurd!</q> he cried, flushing. <q>Your poem is in
praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him&mdash;as you meant it to be. And
who will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand
it? That's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church....
That's Rome, and not even the whole of Rome, it's false&mdash;those are
the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!... And
there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor.
What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who are
these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>
for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen?
We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not
what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They
are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world
in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that's
their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about
it.... It's simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination&mdash;something
like a universal serfdom with them as masters&mdash;that's
all they stand for. They don't even believe in God perhaps.
Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, stay,</q> laughed Ivan, <q>how hot you are! A fantasy you
say, let it be so! Of course it's a fantasy. But allow me to say: do
you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last
centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly
gain? Is that Father Païssy's teaching?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, on the contrary, Father Païssy did once say something
rather the same as you ... but of course it's not the same, not a
bit the same,</q> Alyosha hastily corrected himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>A precious admission, in spite of your <q>not a bit the same.</q> I
ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile
material gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed
by great sorrow and loving humanity? You see, only suppose
that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing
but filthy material gain&mdash;if there's only one like my old
Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made
frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and perfect.
But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyes were
opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain
perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction
that millions of God's creatures have been created as a mockery,
that they will never be capable of using their freedom, that these
poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower, that
it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his dream
of harmony. Seeing all that he turned back and joined&mdash;the clever
people. Surely that could have happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Joined whom, what clever people?</q> cried Alyosha, completely
carried away. <q>They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries
and secrets.... Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
secret. Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, that's his secret!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It's perfectly
true, it's true that that's the whole secret, but isn't that suffering,
at least for a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the
desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity?
In his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the
advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of
life for the feeble, unruly, <q>incomplete, empirical creatures created
in jest.</q> And so, convinced of this, he sees that he must follow the
counsel of the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction,
and therefore accept lying and deception, and lead men consciously
to death and destruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that
they may not notice where they are being led, that the poor blind
creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy. And
note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose ideal the old
man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that tragic?
And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army <q>filled
with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain</q>&mdash;would not
one such be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such
standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of
the Roman Church with all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea.
I tell you frankly that I firmly believe that there has always been
such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement.
Who knows, there may have been some such even among the Roman
Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man
who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found
even now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by
chance but by agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for
the guarding of the mystery, to guard it from the weak and the
unhappy, so as to make them happy. No doubt it is so, and so it
must be indeed. I fancy that even among the Masons there's something
of the same mystery at the bottom, and that that's why the
Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity
of the idea, while it is so essential that there should be one flock
and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea I might
be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are perhaps a Mason yourself!</q> broke suddenly from
Alyosha. <q>You don't believe in God,</q> he added, speaking this time
<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>
very sorrowfully. He fancied besides that his brother was looking
at him ironically. <q>How does your poem end?</q> he asked, suddenly
looking down. <q>Or was it the end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking
he waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence
weighed down upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened
intently all the time, looking gently in his face and evidently not
wishing to reply. The old man longed for Him to say something,
however bitter and terrible. But He suddenly approached the
old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips.
That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His lips moved.
He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: <q>Go, and come
no more ... come not at all, never, never!</q> And he let Him out
into the dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And the old man?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his
idea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you with him, you too?</q> cried Alyosha, mournfully.
</p>

<p>
Ivan laughed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, it's all nonsense, Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of a
senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do
you take it so seriously? Surely you don't suppose I am going
straight off to the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His
work? Good Lord, it's no business of mine. I told you, all I want
is to live on to thirty, and then ... dash the cup to the ground!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the
blue sky, and the woman you love! How will you live, how will
you love them?</q> Alyosha cried sorrowfully. <q>With such a hell in
your heart and your head, how can you? No, that's just what you
are going away for, to join them ... if not, you will kill yourself,
you can't endure it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a strength to endure everything,</q> Ivan said with a
cold smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>What strength?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The strength of the Karamazovs&mdash;the strength of the Karamazov
baseness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption,
yes?</q>
</p>

<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>

<p>
<q>Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall
escape it, and then&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That's
impossible with your ideas.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the Karamazov way, again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Everything is lawful,</q> you mean? Everything is lawful, is
that it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase, which so offended
Miüsov&mdash;and which Dmitri pounced upon so naïvely, and paraphrased!</q>
he smiled queerly. <q>Yes, if you like, <q>everything is lawful</q>
since the word has been said. I won't deny it. And Mitya's
version isn't bad.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha looked at him in silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought that going away from here I have you at least,</q> Ivan
said suddenly, with unexpected feeling; <q>but now I see that there
is no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula,
<q>all is lawful,</q> I won't renounce&mdash;will you renounce me for that,
yes?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's plagiarism,</q> cried Ivan, highly delighted. <q>You stole
that from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it's time
we were going, both of us.</q>
</p>

<p>
They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of
the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, Alyosha,</q> Ivan began in a resolute voice, <q>if I am really
able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering
you. It's enough for me that you are somewhere here, and
I shan't lose my desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take
it as a declaration of love if you like. And now you go to the
right and I to the left. And it's enough, do you hear, enough. I
mean even if I don't go away to-morrow (I think I certainly shall
go) and we meet again, don't say a word more on these subjects.
I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you specially,
never speak to me again,</q> he added, with sudden irritation; <q>it's all
exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn't it? And
I'll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want
to <q>dash the cup to the ground,</q> wherever I may be I'll come to have
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
one more talk with you, even though it were from America, you
may be sure of that. I'll come on purpose. It will be very interesting
to have a look at you, to see what you'll be by that time. It's
rather a solemn promise, you see. And we really may be parting
for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he
is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry with me for
having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more; that's right, now
go.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back.
It was just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the
parting had been very different. The strange resemblance flashed
like an arrow through Alyosha's mind in the distress and dejection
of that moment. He waited a little, looking after his brother. He
suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right
shoulder looked lower than his left. He had never noticed it before.
But all at once he turned too, and almost ran to the monastery. It
was nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened; something new was
growing up in him for which he could not account. The wind had
risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines murmured
gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse.
He almost ran. <q>Pater Seraphicus&mdash;he got that name from somewhere&mdash;where
from?</q> Alyosha wondered. <q>Ivan, poor Ivan, and
when shall I see you again?... Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes,
that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he will save me&mdash;from him and for
ever!</q>
</p>

<p>
Several times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving
Ivan so completely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that
morning, only a few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him
and not to give up doing so, even should he be unable to return to
the monastery that night.

<p>
And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's house. But, strange to say, he was overcome by
insufferable depression, which grew greater at every step he took
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>
towards the house. There was nothing strange in his being depressed;
what was strange was that Ivan could not have said what
